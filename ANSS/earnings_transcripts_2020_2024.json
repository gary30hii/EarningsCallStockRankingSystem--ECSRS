With us today are Ajei Gopal, Senior Executive Officer; Maria Shields, SVP and Chief Financial Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Senior Vice President; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks. Ma'am, you may begin.\nAnnette Arribas: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our fiscal year 2020 Form 10-K have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results and business update, as well as our initial Q1 and fiscal year 2021 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. We note that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Additionally, the company\u2019s reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information. During this call and in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures is included in this morning\u2019s earnings release materials and related Form 8-K. Before I turn the call over to Ajei, I would now like to let everybody know that we are continuing to make progress towards our environmental, social and governance roadmap. Earlier this year, we published our first product hand print use case focused on electric vehicles, illustrating how ANSYS solutions play a critical role in solving many of the industry's challenges. Additionally, we published our non-financial materiality assessment, which will guide our ESG strategy, as well as the human capital infographic highlighting key aspects of our ANSYS culture and talent management. All of this information is available in the sustainability section of our Investor Relations website. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in a 50-year history. We beat up financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, earnings per share, and cash flow. Q4 saw stronger than expected sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters greater than expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased, albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million. On total, that includes eight deals in the eight figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a five-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide and added newly acquired ANSYS technology, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors, and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and as a testament to ANSYS market leadership. As we have consistently said, our years have become increasingly backend loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed our sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong Q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV, which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth, a whole of 10% in constant currency. The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May, 2020 call, with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers, including closing the three largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multi-physics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics, as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers. Moving to products. We advanced a strategy of pervasive simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 Release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology together with ever increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multi-physics portfolio and our simulation platform, including an ANSYS Cloud where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job and ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock where customers can now incorporate ANSYS mechanicals random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime. Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today engineers can analyze these systems using one of two suboptimal techniques, either individual components simulation with manual combination, which can be air pro [ph] or a one-size-fits-all-approach, which can result in long simulation times. Using ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion's game-changing technology an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component. And then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung electronics is using HFSS Mesh Fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics jives uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable. Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combined mission simulation and analysis from AGI with components and system level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer and time mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money, and other crucial resources. This week, we announced the relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior, and as a key enabler for aerospace applications amongst others. PTC, another partner continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted one such deal at SharkNinja, which added Creo Simulation Live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with that spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record Q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high-end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base, with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily backend loaded, similar to, or even slightly more pronounced than 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers are cut back during the pandemic will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for underinvestment in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that served to increase the post-pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic in the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home and that they can use simulation to successfully develop products, even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post-pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy, product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multi-physics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time-to-market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. Next the pandemic seems to push customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products, such as electric vehicles and lightweight fuel efficient aircraft engines as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multi-physics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post-pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long-term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you accounting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to a status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1st, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent, and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria, as CFO on March 1st. With her experience in the tech sector, as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will direct and oversee our M&A function, as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace. She was CFO at Infour and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions and finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development, including a CFO of IBM software middleware business and a cloud business. I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria?\nMaria Shields: Thank you, Ajei. I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past four years. Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights, and then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add all the cadence and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. You're focused on execution, collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year, across both operational and financial fronts, despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December and the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24% and operating margins and EPS results that were both well above the high-end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model, particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add it consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results, as we closed out 2020 or driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million of which 83% was from recurrent sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in leased license revenue. For the time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid-up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yield is 38% constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in leased license sales combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high-end of our Q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96, which also finished well above the high-end of our guidance. We illustrated our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations, it totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection, as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. This translates to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50-year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers, and partners. Now, let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Maria. First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. Together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty. The one ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is one of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of return to normal business operations post the pandemic, our guidance range is continued to be wider than those we have historically provided pre-pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year, with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately $25 million. While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and they continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses, as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately 90%, with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will take up slightly in 2021 towards historical levels. We continue and to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur, while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies, as well as R&D and certain digital transformation projects, as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth.  We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1st, and it factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately one negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high-end of our Q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth, and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew 9%. Our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation as essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. Our full year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020, which was seen any overachievement above the high-end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a 2% headwind to 2021 ACV growth. Although, the environment remained fluid and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post-COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1,790 million to $1,875 million, which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency and EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41% and Q1 2021 operating margins in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30% For full year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1,750 million to $1,825 million, which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed toward the fourth quarter. We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in the range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of requests for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts, as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lower than full year 2021 outlook. Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document.  I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of a team who has delivered such outstanding results, despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to need to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jackson Ader from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I guess we should start off with Maria, heartfelt congratulations on your 90th call and it's -- we're sad to see you go from the CFO role, but glad that sticking around with ANSYS and welcome to Nicole. First question though is for Ajei and your comments about the TAM growth pre-and-post-pandemic. So, can we just get a little bit more color? Is this expectations for all the different components of the TAM, the core simulation, and then the growth opportunities in the IoT and electrification and others, or were you talking specifically about just maybe one or two components of that total TAM mix?\nAjei Gopal: Hey, Jackson, thanks for the question. So, my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which we set at -- which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke off were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic, and certainly with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So, we expect to see that continue certainly even the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So, that's the tailwind. And the second one that we -- that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now, those are, -- I specifically call that telecommunications and consumer electronics, and those are areas which require multi-physics simulation analysis. So, it really reflects on the multi-physics nature about portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking.  But also the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincidence or there's a commonality here with the pandemic, but with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment, whether it's electric vehicles, which we identified and points to before, but also in other things like light-weighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so, this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and it's something that requires multi-physics simulation. So, that was the context of my comments, Jackson.\nJackson Ader: Gotcha. Okay. Great. And then a quick follow-up on the $26 million of ACV upside in the quarter. Was that comment -- Maria or Nicole, was that -- that this was -- ACV that was coming up from renewal maybe in 2021 and was pooled into 2020?\nMaria Shields: No. It was specifically just increments above what we had forecasted. There -- we -- in addition to very solid sales execution, we did see year-end budget flush, which we didn't see in Q4 of 2019, but we did see that this year, and I think some of it was just pent-up demand from perhaps Q2 and Q3 where people were on the sidelines. And when some of the enthusiasm around perhaps the second half of 2021 a return to some sense of normalcy and growth and the vaccines. I think that we just saw some enthusiasm in the customer base that we hadn't experienced in the earlier part of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question and also my best wishes to Maria. And hopefully, you won't be a stranger going forward. So this question for you Ajei. In terms of the shift to digital, and then I realize ANSYS Cloud is still small today. But just wondering how that might affect the adoption of ANSYS Cloud? And as we look ahead, would that be a positive from a monetization perspective relative to on-prem lease?\nAjei Gopal: Yeah. So, if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year, if you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud has continued to increase, and we've seen usage increasing by over a 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS Cloud and reached a much more efficient solution than they would have on premises. For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they show that they were able to reduce simulation runtimes by about 50%, which allowed obviously their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS Cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the Azure infrastructure in which is largely appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So, absolutely. ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that customers are taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud mechanical fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script, as well as things like new workload, like optics, SPEOS, VRX. So we're seeing the usage across all about physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license, so just moving as fast world that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on premises in their own data centers or in their own private clouds. And so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future.\nKen Wong: Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color that Ajei. And then, maybe also another one for you, Ajei. Just wondering if the chip shortage has had any impact on the RedHawk business or potentially change the buying behavior of any of your automotive or consumer electronics customers?\nAjei Gopal: No. I think you're talking about the semiconductor that the availability of manufacturing of semiconductor chips and the shortage of that, I think that has -- that's a sort of a different cycle in the design side. We continue to see demand, robust demand for our products, because there continues to be robust demand and growth in the -- in both semis and like electronics. So no negative impact at all, just the market tailwinds for usage of those technologies. And the fact is that as customers are going to a more and more advanced process knows the investments that we've made in RedHawk and in particular RedHawk-SC starting to pay off. And that obviously translates into more demand for our technology.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Valera from Needham and Company. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Valera: Thank you. And let me add my congratulations to Maria on a great run and your new role and welcome to Nicole. And with that, I just wanted to ask about the Asia-Pac business where you've seen some pretty meaningful underperformance relative to the rest of the business and other you cited any restriction due to COVID, but can't help, but contrast that with a really strong demand that the pure play EDA companies are seeing in Asia kind of exceptional strengths, especially out of China. And I'm going to fill that at least kind of the chip centric side of your business would be seeing that. So just wondering if you can kind of push into that area and give us a little sense of what's going on under the covers?\nMaria Shields: Yeah. So, Rich, what I'd say is some of Asia's performance is also influenced just like the other geographies relative to the timing of large deals. And so, if you take a look at 2019, there were some larger deals in Asia-Pacific that drove -- that drove some of the growth that we enjoyed in 2019. We have -- like many U.S.-based software companies, we have felt the impact of the sanctions on our business in China. And specifically China is one of those markets that still is a perpetual market for us, just because of the timing of when they get access to money. And then they tend to consume large quantities of licenses that will get them through to the next cycle. So, I think the combination of the underperformance in not only China due to sanctions, but we also saw underperformance in India during 2020, that also influenced what you saw in Asia-Pac's results. \nAjei Gopal: And I just point out that China is less than 5% of our overall business. I think something like 4%. So, it's a relatively small piece of a business overall. \nRichard Valera: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I know you've talked about the -- you've had some headwinds from COVID, particularly on the smaller customer side. Have you at all tried to quantify that what the headwind was in 2020?\nMaria Shields: Now, Rich, we can't do anything with precision around that. We just know that in seeing the performance of the channel versus the direct, the enterprise and strategic customers were much more willing to continue to invest through the cycle. And largely because they didn't have some of the liquidity issues that the SMB market that we saw.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning\nAjei Gopal: Morning.\nMaria Shields: Hello.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Thank you to Maria for all the help with the ramp and welcome to Nicole, as well. Maybe two questions here, if I may. One on the operating margin guidance expectations for next year. I think in the prepared script you called out some headwinds from the dilution for the acquisitions. I think that explains a good portion of maybe the delta versus consensus, but also wanted to understand maybe what you guys are doing in terms of SG&A, R&D, I think he added 300 people to your sales and marketing this year. Should we think that that kind of picks up as you take advantage of this TAM in front of you?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. Thanks, John. So, yes. So the AGI, as we've discussed in the remarks, contributed to about a point impact and it really accounts for a meaningful portion of the year here, expense growth. In the second half of last year, we onboarded about 300 people outside of acquisitions, and we ended up at about 4,800 people. In 2021, we continue to make targeted investments headcount, so we are going to continue to invest to grow. We are confident in the long-term outlook of the business. And -- but they're going to be more targeted and primarily in areas of R&D and to some degrees, the sales and operational roles, that support our digital transformation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, I'll direct my two questions to you. But first for Maria and on a personal note, it's been a fascinating quarter century. So thank you for that. Welcome Nicole. So, for Ajei, in the last call, we touched on the subject of your availability of and development of, what we call domain specific applications or industry solutions, perhaps the work you're doing with BMW in a simulation tool chain for automotive, as an example of that, plus AGI now, of course. The question is how are you anticipating the rollout of or adoption of what you suggested would be more and more industry solutions. So how was that factoring into your thinking on this ultimate the next couple of years? And then relatedly, over the last two or more years, the company has been depicting its technology roadmap, your eight long-term technology dimensions, each of which is interesting. But perhaps you could talk about the progress you've made on those or more specifically, which of those eight are perhaps priorities for 2021 and beyond in terms of internal investments, or how you think that might actually affect financial results? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: So, Jay, thanks for the questions. There's a lot -- there's a lot that we could go through and maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing a point technologies back when we started like structures, over the years we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions, as well as organic development. And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which -- it was profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry. And because we have all of these multi-physics capabilities integrated together and exposed in a platform, that makes it easier for our customers, as well as our own ace engineers to build industry specific or customer specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide, as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with the use of simulation as a tool, but also the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made you. You referenced one of them with respect to BMW. We made some announcements in the healthcare space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way that we were architecting our platforms and our capability. Now with respect to the long-term roadmap, I would refer you one of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is, AIML, where we've talked about the use of machine learning. We see that -- we continue to make investments in AIML capability, because we really see AIML as a orthogonal, but supportive technology to simulation. Simulation makes AIML better. The insights from AIML better and AIML can support insights from simulation. And you see this -- you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in a semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave it at that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gal Munda from Berenberg. Please go ahead with your question.\nGal Munda: Hey, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, I'd just like to touch a little bit on this trend that you continue to see in the larger deals. And maybe Ajei, can you talk a little bit about the predictability of those deals and what you've learned over the last few years, especially in terms of the sales cycles or the pipeline? It seems like the ability to be able to close those deals during the pandemic definitely shows that there's an increased activity. So, maybe just a little bit of color around how do say cyclists maybe have evolved over the last few years.\nAjei Gopal: So, Gal, thanks. Thanks for the question. So your question is really how we integrating with some of these larger customer then how we working with them. So, if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and we really started to accelerate them in the last couple of years. It was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid, where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid. And enterprise customers were deemed to be such not only because they had significant spending powers and had large and complex problems to solve, and therefore were spending a lot of money on R&D, but also because we had enterprise customers who were being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers dedicated account management, both on the technical side, as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us -- within some of these large customers that given us a great relationship and a very good understanding of what's going on, and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That coupled with -- the other comment I made about digital transformation, clearly this is an important area for customers. And in the digital transmission of that product lifecycle continues to be important.  The pandemic, as I mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest the customers that they needed to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some senses is a purist digital representation of a product. And so that was -- that's the second sort of broad thread about the recognition that people can be effective. Engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I did the third, and perhaps the most important is that look, at the end of the day simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help, help you accelerate product to market. That's one area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you can -- you don't have to build physical prototypes. You can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. So, when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years in planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value of that simulation that it provide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. Maria, a big congratulations to you and my welcome to Nicole. Ajei, I wanted to go back to -- just the comment and discussion on TAM growing faster. This trend towards system level engineering, it's happening across many of your end markets. It's a notable one. You just discussed how it compliments the ANSYS platform strategy. I would have expected that some of these developments would have been on the long-term planning roadmap.  So, I guess, the question is how, or why are these developing differently such that now it seems to be actually exceeding your expectations?\nAjei Gopal: Well, firstly, with respect to our analysis of the TAM, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, 2019, we did have a pretty comprehensive analysis of the TAM and where it is today and where it's going. And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which was -- which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product lifecycle. We talked about high growth solutions like, electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in non-traditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twin and so forth. And what we did when we presented that, as we pointed out that they were -- that there was more predictability on the basis, use cases off of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer term opportunity in particular simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twin, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variables depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies. And we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment off capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. So that's the way we were a couple of years ago.  The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my scripts have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- they pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that we believe represents an aggregate tailwind and acceleration of activities that may have taken place already. But those -- that's an acceleration. And when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure? How do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera? And you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of products. And as I said in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps, it's because of a broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives. Maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to eco-friendly set of product accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer come in a little bit earlier. So, I think that the core recognition and the elements of the market, the main what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So, I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard. We're not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question and best wishes to Maria and Nicole. I think in the past, ANSYS has talked about how R&D budgets are one of the first budgets to be restored out of the downturns. And ANSYS, as a company, typically sees kind of the inflection faster than maybe some of your peers in the industrial space. And I guess, with the throng Q4, you put up, 20% constant currency, organic ACV growth, large deals, budget flush, it would appear that certainly, you're seeing some strength here and some might see -- might argue, you're seeing some of these budgets come back online. But when I look at your guidance, it implies that ACV growth doesn't really get much better on an organic basis next year. So, I guess, what's driving that? Are there certain end markets or geos that you're seeing caution, or is it just conservatism? I know there's a CFO, with -- the CFO transition, just trying to understand, what would drive such a relatively cautious outlook given the strong results you put up here in the quarter. Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Tyler. Thanks for your question. So, let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say -- the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is the significant overachievement of ACV, and therefore revenue and the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a two point headwind to growth year-over-year. And so what we're seeing really -- what we found in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic, that things -- that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation. And then we are well-positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio over the past couple of years, because we've been investing through the pandemic to come out of it with a position of strength, that we're going to benefit from it. I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum and economic activity is being start to open up and governments continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so, we have visibility into the first quarter into the full year pipeline and the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more backend loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. So, from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we are around right now, but the situation is fluid and we'll continue engaging with you throughout the years updated as we know more.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Swanson from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatthew Swanson: Yeah. Thanks. This is Matt Swanson for Matt Hedberg. Maria, I'll just add on my congratulations. Nicole welcome. Look forward to working with you. A question for both of you. I mean, just given the strength of your here during this challenging pandemic, does it open up or change your philosophy at all around M&A, just thinking there might be some value and some opportunities for some companies that maybe weren't able to pair as well throughout this year? And maybe from a technology talking standpoint, maybe some time sensitivity around companies that might not be able to make it through this pandemic?\nMaria Shields: Yeah. So, Matt, what I'd say is, look, we always have an active pipeline of M&A. We've got a team that's dedicated and we're always looking for things that compliment the portfolio and that aligned with our strategy of pervasive simulation, and equally as important that align with our culture. We've been extremely successful in integrating these acquisitions over the past 20-plus years, because we look for companies that are like us that are dedicated to customer excellence, that are dedicated to advancing the technology and solving the world's most complicated problems. And so, we will absolutely continue to actively search for opportunities to add to the portfolio and to continue to maintain our leadership in this exciting space.\nMatthew Swanson: And then, Ajei, if I can just add a quick one for you. Could you just talk a little bit more about Moxie, which was announced last week? And then kind of more broadly, just -- I feel like in this environment and especially those high ROI solutions might be really compelling to your customers. Could you just talk a little bit about how that's playing into the demand process right now?\nAjei Gopal: So, Moxie -- again, I don't want to get too detailed here. But Moxie is a new capability that's being offered by AGI and essentially engineers -- it enables engineers to execute behavioral system L models in a virtual simulation environment, such as AGI's STK toolkit. And it's really to be able to analyze and validate the models to make sure that they can meet mission requirements. So, we're very excited about the technology. I think, it adds to our portfolio and our capabilities. And we can certainly talk more about the technical details perhaps at a later point.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we've reached the end of the allotted time for today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Ajei for any closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, operator. Q4 was an excellent quarter and a great ending to a strong 2020, all thanks to our one ANSYS team around the world. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our business, as well as our deep customer relationships. Several of those customers will discuss. They use as a simulation during our upcoming Simulation World, which was on April 20th to 21st of this year. This virtual event, the largest of its kind, to tens of thousands of customers, prospects students, press, and, of course, investors last year. This year Simulation World will feature customers such as Johnson & Johnson, HPE, Ferrari, Travel with Me [ph] and Northrop Grumman. You can register by attending simulationworld.com. Thank you for attending today's call and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's conference call. We thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maria Shields",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. I truly appreciate the kind words and your ongoing support and partnership over the past four years. Hello, everyone. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter, resulting in record financial performance for both the quarter and the year. I'll spend a few minutes walking through an overview of the Q4 financial highlights, and then I'll turn the call over to Nicole to add all the cadence and quantitative color around our initial outlook and key assumptions for the first quarter and full year 2021. Before I get into the details of our financial highlights, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire ANSYS team. You're focused on execution, collaboration and ongoing commitment to customer excellence enabled us to finish with both a record quarter and year, across both operational and financial fronts, despite the many uncertainties and disruptions that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also very excited about the closing of the AGI acquisition in early December and the positive progress that the teams have made on integration activities. We closed the quarter with total revenue of $628 million or constant currency growth of 24% and operating margins and EPS results that were both well above the high-end of our Q4 guidance. This is quite a testament to the strength and durability of the ANSYS business model, particularly when you consider the strong comparable of Q4 2019. Let me also add it consistent with every quarter of this past year, our revenue results, as we closed out 2020 or driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the quarter continue, with 20% constant currency growth in ACV to a total of $666 million of which 83% was from recurrent sources. This compares to 78% in last year's fourth quarter. This is a new record for Q4 with respect to both total ACV and the percentage that is attributable to recurring sources. Q4's revenue results reflect the continued trend in solid lease sales that we've been experiencing throughout 2020, with a record 54% constant currency increase in leased license revenue. For the time in 2020, in the fourth quarter, we reported a return to growth in the paid-up software license line with 11% growth in constant currency. This yield is 38% constant currency growth in our software license revenue. The increase in leased license sales combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q4 total of $967 million, an 11% increase over last year's comparable balance. The strong top line results combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline helped to drive a fourth quarter gross margin of 92% and an operating margin of 52%, which finished well above the high-end of our Q4 guidance. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q4 was 19.5%, in line with our expectations. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.96, which also finished well above the high-end of our guidance. We illustrated our cash and balance sheet position in the fourth quarter with cash flow from operations, it totaled $174 million, a 25% increase over last year's fourth quarter. The quarter's cash flow benefited from very strong receivables collection, as well as the deferral of certain tax payments into 2021. This translates to a new record of $547 million for the full year. We closed the year with a total of $913 million in cash and short-term investments, and a total debt balance of $798 million. Let me just close by saying that we are extremely fortunate to have finished 2020 with the best financial performance in our 50-year history. These results are a testament to the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the tenacity, dedication and hard work of our employees, customers, and partners. Now, let me turn the call over to Nicole, who will continue with the topic of guidance. Nicole? No. It was specifically just increments above what we had forecasted. There -- we -- in addition to very solid sales execution, we did see year-end budget flush, which we didn't see in Q4 of 2019, but we did see that this year, and I think some of it was just pent-up demand from perhaps Q2 and Q3 where people were on the sidelines. And when some of the enthusiasm around perhaps the second half of 2021 a return to some sense of normalcy and growth and the vaccines. I think that we just saw some enthusiasm in the customer base that we hadn't experienced in the earlier part of the year. Yeah. So, Rich, what I'd say is some of Asia's performance is also influenced just like the other geographies relative to the timing of large deals. And so, if you take a look at 2019, there were some larger deals in Asia-Pacific that drove -- that drove some of the growth that we enjoyed in 2019. We have -- like many U.S.-based software companies, we have felt the impact of the sanctions on our business in China. And specifically China is one of those markets that still is a perpetual market for us, just because of the timing of when they get access to money. And then they tend to consume large quantities of licenses that will get them through to the next cycle. So, I think the combination of the underperformance in not only China due to sanctions, but we also saw underperformance in India during 2020, that also influenced what you saw in Asia-Pac's results. Now, Rich, we can't do anything with precision around that. We just know that in seeing the performance of the channel versus the direct, the enterprise and strategic customers were much more willing to continue to invest through the cycle. And largely because they didn't have some of the liquidity issues that the SMB market that we saw. Hello. Yeah. So, Matt, what I'd say is, look, we always have an active pipeline of M&A. We've got a team that's dedicated and we're always looking for things that compliment the portfolio and that aligned with our strategy of pervasive simulation, and equally as important that align with our culture. We've been extremely successful in integrating these acquisitions over the past 20-plus years, because we look for companies that are like us that are dedicated to customer excellence, that are dedicated to advancing the technology and solving the world's most complicated problems. And so, we will absolutely continue to actively search for opportunities to add to the portfolio and to continue to maintain our leadership in this exciting space."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, capping off the most successful year in a 50-year history. We beat up financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including revenue, ACV, earnings per share, and cash flow. Q4 saw stronger than expected sales activity, which we believe was driven by a combination of deferred customer spending from earlier quarters greater than expected end of year customer budgets in the Americas and in EMEA, coupled with increased, albeit cautious optimism in the economy, thanks to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines and expected government stimulus activities. During Q4, we closed nearly 100 deals over $1 million. On total, that includes eight deals in the eight figures. One of those agreements was the second largest deal in the history of the company, a five-year $79 million contract with an enterprise customer. While economic conditions forces global company to reduce expenses across the business, it renewed and expanded its use of ANSYS core solver technology worldwide and added newly acquired ANSYS technology, including electronics reliability and dynamic analysis. This contract reflects the customer's long-term decision to standardize on ANSYS technology over other vendors, and to reduce its reliance on physical testing and as a testament to ANSYS market leadership. As we have consistently said, our years have become increasingly backend loaded due primarily to the timing of large deals. This steady progression has allowed our sales and operations teams to support an increasingly higher magnitude of business in the fourth quarter of each year. Our strong Q4 2020 execution drove record quarterly ACV, which was over $100 million higher than the previous largest quarter in Q4 of 2019. The strength and volume of business that we closed in Q4 resulted in annual ACV growth, a whole of 10% in constant currency. The year developed largely as we had predicted in our May, 2020 call, with regards to our performance by industry, geography and company size. During the year, we exceeded our expectations with enterprise customers, including closing the three largest deals in our history. That speaks to the importance of ANSYS' integrated multi-physics simulation capabilities that connect all the major physics, as well as to the trusted partnerships that we have built with our enterprise customers. Moving to products. We advanced a strategy of pervasive simulation with our recent delivery of ANSYS 2021 Release 1 to our customers. With R1, engineers can harness the advances in simulation technology together with ever increasing computing power to drive new levels of product innovation. This comprehensive release features advances across our entire integrated multi-physics portfolio and our simulation platform, including an ANSYS Cloud where customers can now scale beyond 1,000 cores for a single job and ANSYS Discovery, which now includes automated thermal analysis to predict fluid and solid thermal behaviors for electronic cooling and heat management devices. And ANSYS Sherlock where customers can now incorporate ANSYS mechanicals random vibration analysis into their design for reliability workflow, thereby improving product reliability and lifetime. Another key element of R1 is ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion. This breakthrough solution simplifies the development of modern electronic products, which are incredibly complex systems consisting of multiple interacting components. Today engineers can analyze these systems using one of two suboptimal techniques, either individual components simulation with manual combination, which can be air pro [ph] or a one-size-fits-all-approach, which can result in long simulation times. Using ANSYS HFSS Mesh Fusion's game-changing technology an engineer can solve each component at a level of fidelity most relevant for that component. And then HFSS automatically fuses the results. This virtually eradicates the costs and the risks of traditional methods, enabling engineers to efficiently design and optimize complex products. Samsung electronics is using HFSS Mesh Fusion to create optimal designs and to shrink design cycle times and costs for its next-generation flat screen televisions. The electronics jives uses this innovative technology to develop advanced designs that were previously unimaginable. Moving to M&A. In Q4, we closed our acquisition of Analytical Graphics, Inc., or AGI. With AGI, we will be able to address a broader market called digital mission engineering, which combined mission simulation and analysis from AGI with components and system level simulation from ANSYS. Based on a third-party market analysis and primary interviews with industry experts, we believe that the AGI acquisition increases ANSYS' total addressable market by $800 million. That market is being fueled by the replacement of open source code, unsustainable in-house code and the ongoing growth in the number of missions. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer and time mission, increasing the likelihood of success and saving them time, money, and other crucial resources. This week, we announced the relationship with Keysight, which connects AGI's mission analysis software with Keysight high fidelity RS systems modeling capability. This partnership builds on an existing relationship, which empowers engineers to evaluate mission level behavior, and as a key enabler for aerospace applications amongst others. PTC, another partner continues to see success with its OEM of ANSYS technology. In its most recent earnings call, PTC reported that Creo powered by ANSYS products grew bookings by more than 20% in the quarter. The company highlighted one such deal at SharkNinja, which added Creo Simulation Live to help spark innovation and decrease product development cycle times. As we look ahead to 2021, I'd like to reflect on the COVID-19 pandemic and put it in context of the ANSYS business. COVID had an adverse impact on our 2020 results most pronounced in Q2 and Q3 with some customers choosing to be cautious with that spending. However, our strong execution in the back half of the year, including the record Q4 performance, resulted in ACV above the high-end of our updated May guidance and within the originally established range for the year. We are seeing a continuation of Q4's cautious optimism in our customer base, with the expectation that the economic pressures of the pandemic will start to ease in the second half of 2021, but tempered by concerns with virus mutations and vaccine rollout schedules. The takeaway is that we're assuming greater uncertainty in the timing of sales activities than we would have had this been a non-COVID year. We are also planning for 2021 to be heavily backend loaded, similar to, or even slightly more pronounced than 2020. And we expect a wider range of outcomes in our full year projections as was the case in 2020. You will hear more about our guidance for 2021 shortly. Let me now move to the long-term to when the pandemic is behind us. While we are not in a position to quantify these considerations, I believe that some customers are cut back during the pandemic will increase spending in R&D and simulation to compensate for underinvestment in 2020. More important, however, I believe that we will see a number of tailwinds that served to increase the post-pandemic market growth rates as compared with our pre-pandemic projections. First, in a recent survey of nearly 900 executives and managers across industries, the firm McKinsey found the pandemic may have accelerated digital transformation by as much as a decade. I believe this is particularly relevant for our customers and that they will hasten their digital transformations post-pandemic in the process driving increased and deeper use of simulation. The pandemic proved that R&D engineers are effective when working from home and that they can use simulation to successfully develop products, even with no access to their physical labs. As companies move to hybrid work models post-pandemic, they must accelerate their digital transformations to replace legacy, product development processes with modern tools and techniques. Multi-physics simulation with its core value proposition of helping to accelerate time-to-market and to deliver cost savings will be key to these transformations. Next the pandemic seems to push customers to accelerate roadmaps and to innovate faster in areas such as telecommunications and consumer electronics. We are also seeing increased R&D in the creation of eco-friendly products, such as electric vehicles and lightweight fuel efficient aircraft engines as we discussed in our last earnings call. All of these products are sophisticated and complex and require integrated multi-physics simulation for design and development. That will continue to drive increased post-pandemic demand across our entire portfolio, including our newly acquired AGI mission offerings. To summarize, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, Q4 was an outstanding quarter, marked by record financial results. Looking long-term, we believe that the pandemic may actually cause our total addressable market to go faster than our pre-pandemic projections. This makes me confident that as the market leader ANSYS will be able to continue to drive strong and profitable long-term growth. Our next speaker is Maria Shields. As you may know, Maria has been our CFO since 1998. And for those of you accounting, that's 90 quarterly earnings calls. She's been instrumental in guiding ANSYS on a remarkable journey from our initial public offering in 1996 to a status today as a simulation industry leader. And it's very fitting that we have delivered record results in her last full quarter as CFO. On March 1st, she will transition into a new role of Senior Vice President of Administration, where she will focus on company culture, talent, and technology to help us operate at even greater efficiencies. Former board member, Nicole Anasenes will succeed Maria, as CFO on March 1st. With her experience in the tech sector, as well as the knowledge of ANSYS, Nicole hit the ground running since joining ANSYS full-time in December. In addition to the traditional CFO responsibilities, Nicole will direct and oversee our M&A function, as well as ANSYS' digital transformation. Nicole was CFO and COO at Squarespace. She was CFO at Infour and spent 17 years with IBM in various leadership positions and finance, mergers and acquisitions and market development, including a CFO of IBM software middleware business and a cloud business. I'll now turn the call over to Maria to discuss our Q4 and 2020 financials, and then to Nicole to give details around the 2021 outlook and assumptions for the year. Maria? Hey, Jackson, thanks for the question. So, my comments very specifically in the script on TAM, one was around the increase in TAM as a result of the AGI acquisition, which we set at -- which we said added about $800 million to our total addressable market. The other comments about tailwinds that I spoke off were more -- were harder to quantify. As I said in the script, the point about digital transformation is that we have seen customers embrace simulation more during the pandemic, and certainly with the recognition that their engineers could work from home effectively away from corporate labs, that's also been another tailwind for the use of simulation. So, we expect to see that continue certainly even the value proposition of simulation being able to drive product to market faster and save money. So, that's the tailwind. And the second one that we -- that I pointed to was, in certain areas, we've seen increased levels of investment. Now, those are, -- I specifically call that telecommunications and consumer electronics, and those are areas which require multi-physics simulation analysis. So, it really reflects on the multi-physics nature about portfolio, which I think was the question that you were asking.  But also the other interesting thing that we've noticed, which I pointed to in the comments is in the area of eco-friendly products. And I'm not sure if it's coincidence or there's a commonality here with the pandemic, but with the -- in that area, we've seen certainly increased levels of investment, whether it's electric vehicles, which we identified and points to before, but also in other things like light-weighting and eco-friendly aircraft engines and others. And so, this area continues to be also an area of increased growth and it's something that requires multi-physics simulation. So, that was the context of my comments, Jackson. Yeah. So, if your question -- the question was about ANSYS Cloud and I guess usage during the pandemic or during the last year, if you look at usage, the demand for ANSYS Cloud has continued to increase, and we've seen usage increasing by over a 100% between 2019 and 2020. And what's interesting, and I think I mentioned this in the last call as well, we've had customers who've used ANSYS Cloud and reached a much more efficient solution than they would have on premises. For example, Rockwell Automation, I think I mentioned, is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development process, and they show that they were able to reduce simulation runtimes by about 50%, which allowed obviously their engineers to solve problems more accurately. And the reason for that is because ANSYS Cloud is optimized for the ANSYS workload, and we've done some work to make sure that the Azure infrastructure in which is largely appropriate, and we can take advantage of the latest hardware and interconnect that Azure has available. So, absolutely. ANSYS Cloud is certainly something that customers are taking advantage of during this time. We've made the majority of our flagships available on ANSYS Cloud mechanical fluids, electromagnetics, et cetera. I just talked about the scale out that we have available there on the script, as well as things like new workload, like optics, SPEOS, VRX. So we're seeing the usage across all about physics, and we're obviously seeing greater usage. And that coupled with the flexibility that we have, which allows customers to bring their own license or bring their own hardware license or software license, so just moving as fast world that hybrid flexibility that we can afford, I think gives customers a lot of options. That being said, while we're excited about the cloud offering and we're very encouraged by the rapid progress, I think it's important to note that the majority of our customers today use ANSYS products on premises in their own data centers or in their own private clouds. And so ANSYS Cloud is obviously growing rapidly, but it's still a very small piece of our business today and for the foreseeable future. No. I think you're talking about the semiconductor that the availability of manufacturing of semiconductor chips and the shortage of that, I think that has -- that's a sort of a different cycle in the design side. We continue to see demand, robust demand for our products, because there continues to be robust demand and growth in the -- in both semis and like electronics. So no negative impact at all, just the market tailwinds for usage of those technologies. And the fact is that as customers are going to a more and more advanced process knows the investments that we've made in RedHawk and in particular RedHawk-SC starting to pay off. And that obviously translates into more demand for our technology. And I just point out that China is less than 5% of our overall business. I think something like 4%. So, it's a relatively small piece of a business overall. Morning. So, Jay, thanks for the questions. There's a lot -- there's a lot that we could go through and maybe in the interest of time, I'll just focus on a couple of things. When you think about our journey as a company, we've gone from providing a point technologies back when we started like structures, over the years we've brought together a comprehensive set of physics through a combination of acquisitions, as well as organic development. And now we have a full-fledged set of physics that are integrated together. And it's this integration capability across all of these physics that's profoundly important. And we've continued to add to that with materials technologies, for example, with optimization capabilities, et cetera. And that has led to the building up of our platform capability, which -- it was profoundly important to be able to address and provide that agility to support different industry. And because we have all of these multi-physics capabilities integrated together and exposed in a platform, that makes it easier for our customers, as well as our own ace engineers to build industry specific or customer specific solutions that take advantage of the core capabilities that we provide, as well as integrate with core components that might be available from outside of our own ecosystem. So that's been the direction that we're pursuing. Our technology is available both on-premises and in the cloud. And I think we have a very robust and a very strong technical underpinnings to be able to support not only the more traditional use case where you're dealing with the use of simulation as a tool, but also the use of simulation within as part of an integrated platform to deliver value added applications to customers. And you're seeing this in some of the announcements that we've made you. You referenced one of them with respect to BMW. We made some announcements in the healthcare space and others where we're working with partners who are able to provide application specific intelligence that wraps on top of our simulation solutions because of the way that we were architecting our platforms and our capability. Now with respect to the long-term roadmap, I would refer you one of those key elements is the platform. And obviously, we just talked about platform a second ago. Another area that perhaps might be interesting is, AIML, where we've talked about the use of machine learning. We see that -- we continue to make investments in AIML capability, because we really see AIML as a orthogonal, but supportive technology to simulation. Simulation makes AIML better. The insights from AIML better and AIML can support insights from simulation. And you see this -- you see these technologies and techniques already being incorporated into our products. You see this, for example, in a semiconductor portfolio, and you continue to see this integrated into other aspects of our products, whether it comes to usability, whether it comes to helping customers or helping engineers navigate the solution space and so forth. And we can obviously go into more details, but in the interest of time, let's just leave it at that. So, Gal, thanks. Thanks for the question. So your question is really how we integrating with some of these larger customer then how we working with them. So, if you recall, when we went through the go-to-market transformation that we spoke off a couple of years ago, and we really started to accelerate them in the last couple of years. It was around putting together a traditional customer pyramid, where we had enterprise customers at the top of the pyramid. And enterprise customers were deemed to be such not only because they had significant spending powers and had large and complex problems to solve, and therefore were spending a lot of money on R&D, but also because we had enterprise customers who were being supported by specialized teams. And so we would have -- we were able to allocate to these enterprise customers dedicated account management, both on the technical side, as well as the sales side to help navigate through the account. That process has been underway for a few years. When you -- and so that gives us -- within some of these large customers that given us a great relationship and a very good understanding of what's going on, and we've been able to help educate the customers about the capabilities that ANSYS can provide. That coupled with -- the other comment I made about digital transformation, clearly this is an important area for customers. And in the digital transmission of that product lifecycle continues to be important.  The pandemic, as I mentioned earlier, accelerated that and made it clear and manifest the customers that they needed to enable their engineers to be able to work from anywhere. And that's obviously possible through a digital thread and simulation in some senses is a purist digital representation of a product. And so that was -- that's the second sort of broad thread about the recognition that people can be effective. Engineers can be effective to taking advantage of the technology from wherever. I did the third, and perhaps the most important is that look, at the end of the day simulation provides tremendous value to customers. They are -- we've talked about this for a long time. We've said, look, we can help, help you accelerate product to market. That's one area, that drives top line revenue growth. And we've also said, we can help you save money. We can help you save money because you can -- you don't have to build physical prototypes. You can do the proverbial more with less. And that also resonates with customers, especially in tough economic times. So, when you put all of this stuff together, it's no wonder that we're seeing some large deals from customers. This is not accidental. This has been planned. This has been multi-years in planning to make sure that we build these relationships to help them with their digital transformation and to continue to drive investments in the portfolio and to continue to show the value of that simulation that it provide. Well, firstly, with respect to our analysis of the TAM, if you go back to our Investor Day from a couple of years ago, 2019, we did have a pretty comprehensive analysis of the TAM and where it is today and where it's going. And we talked about a number of areas. We talked about the core business. We talked about, which was -- which is the historical use of simulation and the design and validation phase of the product lifecycle. We talked about high growth solutions like, electric vehicles or electrification, autonomy, IoT, 5G. And then we talked about simulation being used in non-traditional use cases and things like predictive maintenance through digital twin and so forth. And what we did when we presented that, as we pointed out that they were -- that there was more predictability on the basis, use cases off of simulation as it's historically been. But in some of these longer term opportunity in particular simulation being used, for example, in predictive maintenance and digital twin, we pointed out that there was a significant amount of variables depending on the rate of adoption of digital technologies. And we talked about how that was being affected by assumptions you make about the pace and rate of deployment off capabilities that may have historically not used simulation. So that's the way we were a couple of years ago.  The observations that we've seen in the pandemic, as I said in my scripts have been very specifically on certain areas. The digital transformation comment is real. Customers are recognizing they need to spend more -- they pay more attention to the digital transformation. We've talked a lot about this on the call already. And so that we believe represents an aggregate tailwind and acceleration of activities that may have taken place already. But those -- that's an acceleration. And when you start to think about some of these other areas like electronics, consumer electronics, telecommunications, again, the pandemic caused people to think more about what does it mean for the communications infrastructure? How do I interact with my office working remotely, et cetera? And you started to see that level of interest in the end markets, which has obviously translated into increased demand in the electronics and high-tech vertical for us, which translates across to a number of products. And as I said in certain areas like green, it's not clear that it's directly related to the pandemic, but we continue to see increased focus on this. Perhaps, it's because of a broader recognition of the importance of ESG initiatives. Maybe it's because of the pandemic, but we're continuing to see more activities there. And again, this entire area of getting to eco-friendly set of product accelerates activities that might otherwise have taken longer come in a little bit earlier. So, I think that the core recognition and the elements of the market, the main what we had talked about, the question is timing. And as I said also in the call, it's hard for us to quantify what the effects of these tailwinds are going to be. So, I want to be very clear that we see this anecdotally, but it's hard. We're not quantifying the effects of these tailwinds at this point. So, Moxie -- again, I don't want to get too detailed here. But Moxie is a new capability that's being offered by AGI and essentially engineers -- it enables engineers to execute behavioral system L models in a virtual simulation environment, such as AGI's STK toolkit. And it's really to be able to analyze and validate the models to make sure that they can meet mission requirements. So, we're very excited about the technology. I think, it adds to our portfolio and our capabilities. And we can certainly talk more about the technical details perhaps at a later point. Thank you, operator. Q4 was an excellent quarter and a great ending to a strong 2020, all thanks to our one ANSYS team around the world. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our business, as well as our deep customer relationships. Several of those customers will discuss. They use as a simulation during our upcoming Simulation World, which was on April 20th to 21st of this year. This virtual event, the largest of its kind, to tens of thousands of customers, prospects students, press, and, of course, investors last year. This year Simulation World will feature customers such as Johnson & Johnson, HPE, Ferrari, Travel with Me [ph] and Northrop Grumman. You can register by attending simulationworld.com. Thank you for attending today's call and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria. First, I want to echo Maria's congratulations and gratitude to the entire ANSYS team for such an amazing 2020. Together, we delivered stellar outcomes in the face of unprecedented business uncertainty. The one ANSYS culture of teamwork and commitment to customer success that drove those results is one of the many reasons I am so thrilled to join the team. Looking into 2021, I want to share some of the key dynamics we have factored into our guidance. Due to the continued uncertainty about the timing and impact of return to normal business operations post the pandemic, our guidance range is continued to be wider than those we have historically provided pre-pandemic. We anticipate that the current environment will continue through the first half of the year and expect a recovery in the business environment during the second half of the year, with increased global economic stimulus and the global availability of vaccines. We continue to believe the impact will have a disproportionate effect on our small and medium sized customers versus larger customers throughout 2021. We estimate trade restrictions between the U.S. and China have adversely impact our annual sales by approximately $25 million. While the trade environment has been rapidly changing and they continue to do so under the new U.S. administration, our outlook factors in the existing trade restrictions and dynamics that are in place today. We are expecting to see a continued mix shift from perpetual licenses to lease licenses, as customers continue to find the flexibility of lease licensing and operating on the cloud more appealing. The reduced capital outlay associated with the leasing model is also more appealing to certain customers during a time of economic uncertainty. Our blended renewal rates across maintenance and leases have historically been approximately 90%, with the renewal rates on maintenance agreements being even higher. Our renewal rates have remained high with only a slight reduction as compared to our historical experience. And our assumptions are that they will take up slightly in 2021 towards historical levels. We continue and to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur, while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity that we see ahead. We have also maintained and intend to continue our commitment to invest in our acquired companies, as well as R&D and certain digital transformation projects, as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth.  We completed the acquisition of AGI on December 1st, and it factored the expected impact into guidance, which translates to approximately one negative point of margin. We expect this dilutive impact to be the most pronounced in the first year post acquisition, consistent with our past experiences and approach to integration. As we look ahead to 2021, we expect to see a very similar seasonal pattern as we've seen in prior years, with a disproportionately large Q4, driven by customer planning and year-end spending patterns. In Q4 2020, we saw an outsized shift in customer behavior in December relative to what has historically occurred. There was a significant and unexpected acceleration in customer decisions to both purchase and pay. We exceeded the high-end of our Q4 2020 guidance on ACV by $26 million with 20% constant currency growth, and full year 2020 cash flow guidance by $72 million and grew 9%. Our strong finish leaves us optimistic and reinforces our belief that customers view simulation as essential and will continue to invest in their own digital transformation. Our full year 2021 guidance reflects an improvement in momentum in both ACV and cash flow. However, some of the impact of that momentum started in December of 2020, which was seen any overachievement above the high-end of our guidance. While this momentum is positive, the dynamic also negatively affects 2021 growth comparisons for key financial metrics. For example, the $26 million of overachievement in ACV creates a 2% headwind to 2021 ACV growth. Although, the environment remained fluid and we are still in the midst of the pandemic, we believe that if post-COVID economic recovery and the current trade environment remains in line with our expectations, our long-term guidance of $2 billion ACV in 2022 is attainable. Now let me get to the specifics of our guidance. In full year 2021, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1,790 million to $1,875 million, which is growth of 6% to 11% or 3% to 8% in constant currency and EPS of $6.44 to $6.92. For Q1 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $360 million, which is 8% to 17% growth or 5% to 12% in constant currency and EPS of $0.73 to $0.90. Our outlook for full year 2021 is to maintain industry-leading operating margins, which we expect to be in the range of 40% to 41% and Q1 2021 operating margins in the range of 24% to 27.5%. The lower Q1 2021 operating margins reflect the seasonal nature of our business with a relatively lower revenue contribution in the quarter, similar to what we experienced in Q1 of last year with an operating margin below 30% For full year 2021, we expect ACV in the range of $1,750 million to $1,825 million, which translates to 8% to 13% growth or 6% to 11% in constant currency. As we mentioned earlier, we expect ACV to be highly skewed toward the fourth quarter. We are expecting to deliver full year operating cash flow in the range of $475 million to $515 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV and profitability. It considers the continued trend of requests for extended payment terms negotiated in new contracts, as well as the timing of certain early collections and deferred tax payments in 2020 that collectively raised full year 2020 cash flow and lower than full year 2021 outlook. Additional details related to the cash flow guidance and specific impact to full year 2020 and 2021 are more fully provided in our prepared remarks document. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q1 and full year 2021 are also contained in the prepared remarks document.  I am so proud of and thrilled to be part of a team who has delivered such outstanding results, despite so many macro headwinds and business disruptions during a time of personal hardship for many. I am confident that with this team, we will be able to continue to need to deliver on our strategy of pervasive simulation and help our customers achieve their innovation and sustainability goals Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Sure. Thanks, John. So, yes. So the AGI, as we've discussed in the remarks, contributed to about a point impact and it really accounts for a meaningful portion of the year here, expense growth. In the second half of last year, we onboarded about 300 people outside of acquisitions, and we ended up at about 4,800 people. In 2021, we continue to make targeted investments headcount, so we are going to continue to invest to grow. We are confident in the long-term outlook of the business. And -- but they're going to be more targeted and primarily in areas of R&D and to some degrees, the sales and operational roles, that support our digital transformation. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Tyler. Thanks for your question. So, let me characterize kind of some of the assumptions that we put into guidance. And I'd say -- the first thing I'd point out is what Maria spoke about, which is the significant overachievement of ACV, and therefore revenue and the rest of the P&L in the quarter. And so that overachievement on the ACV side alone is about a two point headwind to growth year-over-year. And so what we're seeing really -- what we found in the fourth quarter leaves us a lot of optimism that things -- once that we get through the capitulation of the pandemic, that things -- that there's a strong demand for simulation that customers are accelerating their digital transformation. And then we are well-positioned based on the investments we've made in the portfolio over the past couple of years, because we've been investing through the pandemic to come out of it with a position of strength, that we're going to benefit from it. I think what we're expecting to see and what's baked into the guidance is that generally speaking, the first half is going to continue to have its ups and downs really because of COVID uncertainty. And by the second half of the year, we expect to see more momentum and economic activity is being start to open up and governments continue to do the right thing to support economic development. And so, we have visibility into the first quarter into the full year pipeline and the guidance really reflects the strength of the pipeline. And like other years, we're expecting to see it more backend loaded from an ACV and a revenue perspective, driven by the timing of large multiyear deals and customer planning activities. So, from our perspective, sitting here in February, it's just a little difficult to predict such a significant level of overachievement that we saw in the fourth quarter, sitting where we are around right now, but the situation is fluid and we'll continue engaging with you throughout the years updated as we know more."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Senior Executive Officer; Maria Shields, SVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks. Please proceed.\nAnnette Arribas: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our third quarter Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter financial results and business update as well as our Q4 and updated fiscal year 2020 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. We note that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Additionally, the company\u2019s reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information. During the call and in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures is included in this morning\u2019s earnings release materials and related Form 8-K. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for ANSYS meeting or beating our financial guidance on all key metrics. Our performance demonstrates that our core value proposition of helping organizations increase that top line, while driving bottom line savings continues to resonate with the market. I\u2019m excited that the demand for ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics solutions is strong and growing. And it\u2019s furthering a strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle. Based on our year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline for the fourth quarter, we are increasing both the high-end and the midpoint of our 2020 guidance for ACV revenue and EPS. Maria will have the details in a few minutes. Our prepared remarks document has details about the quarter, but let me provide some regional perspective. We anticipate that the Americas will be our strongest region for the full year. From a quarterly perspective, Asia-Pacific was strong in Q3 with Japan leading the way, reflecting our ongoing progress towards multi-physics multi-year lease deals. We expect EMEA to show a good growth in Q4 driven by the timing of larger deals. During Q3, our enterprise and strategic account program continue to show strength with approximately 50% of our Q3 ACV coming from our top 100 customers. I\u2019m excited that we closed a five-year $72 million lease with a North American enterprise customer, our largest agreement in the quarter and the second largest in the history of the company. This deal results in ACV and revenue in Q3 and primarily in Q4 and comes after the almost $100 million sale that we announced last quarter. We still continued headwinds this quarter with small and medium businesses across geographies, consistent with what we have previously communicated. From an industry point of view, the high-tech, automotive and ground transportation, and aerospace and defense sectors continue to be our strongest performance for the full year. On our past calls, I have given some additional color around particular aspects of our business. Today, I will discuss our successes in the aerospace and defense vertical. A&D is ANSYS\u2019 second largest sector at about 18% of our trailing 12 months ACV. Although, the pandemic has impacted commercial air travel, we continue to see spending in the sector thanks to important strategic initiatives. These include eco-friendly fuel-efficient engines, Space 2.0 initiatives such as rocket design and satellite deployments and national defense. I would like to highlight two important Q3 deals in which companies will use ANSYS simulation to develop eco-friendly or aircraft engines. These companies are relying on ANSYS to improve engine efficiency, reduce engine weight, and avoid fuel inefficient over design. The first agreement was with Honeywell, which is using ANSYS simulation to automate its engineering workflows to maximize operational efficiency and drive process improvements. As a result, Honeywell will benefit from product wide traceability and reusability, while significantly cutting development cycle times. The second was with a major aircraft engine manufacturer that is investing $34 million over the next five years to standardize on ANSYS to achieve its vision of developing next generation engines at lower costs. Space 2.0 companies are democratizing space by launching satellites and astronauts into orbit. And they are embracing the use of simulation to develop better products and to make smarter decisions faster. Firefly Aerospace, one of the more than 1,000 companies that have benefited from the ANSYS startup program recently announced that it has realized about $15 million in savings from using our simulation for critical tasks leading to a design that can withstand the extreme conditions of liftoff flight and space travel. We are seeing ongoing investments in multi-physics simulation by government agencies and defense contractors, which are trying to solve next generation problems in the interest of national security. These organizations are turning to ANSYS, because of our simulation leadership and advanced multi-physics capabilities. In Q3, we saw investment from a large North American defense contractor for the design of an advanced aircraft optical sensor. To help calibrate sensor algorithms to reduce noise and blurriness due to high speed air flow, our team developed and deployed a fully coupled arrow optical solution. This competitive win was possible not only because of ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics leadership, but also because of the unparalleled accuracy of our products. ANSYS simulations eliminated eight weeks of testing for the company lowering test costs by 60% and increasing engineering productivity by up to 15% using the new workflow. We signed another multimillion dollar Q3 deal this time with a government agency to use ANSYS to design chips that are more secure. This organization is relying on an important multi-physics breakthrough by ANSYS R&D, in which simulation can be used to help chip design as prevent hard to detect side channel attacks, specifically the new ANSYS offering, which is deployed and runs on the customers secure private cloud, enables chip and system designers to simulate and measure their vulnerability to security attacks while the chip is being designed. As an aside, this organization was amongst the first customers to serve the needs of its users and prime contractors using an ANSYS private cloud that is ANSYS products deployed and running on a shared secured infrastructure. Let me move from customers to acquisitions. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire AGI a pioneer and leader in the analysis and simulation of missions, such as satellite launches, national defense and search and rescue operations. ANSYS has not traditionally participated in this area, which is growing due to the increasing number of missions. Historically, customer needs were partially addressed by commercial software with multiple applications all by in-house codes. AGI has a purpose built solution for mission analysis and simulation, and has become a leading firm in this area. By combining forces with AGI, we will be able to address a broader opportunity called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI and components and system level simulation from ANSYS. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer\u2019s entire mission, thereby increasing the likelihood of success and saving customers\u2019 time, money, and other crucial resources. You may remember that we formed a partnership with AGI last year. And one of the results of that alliance with the connection between its products and Ansys HFSS our flagship electromagnetic solver. Several large customers are using both companies\u2019 products together. One large prime contractor, for example, uses AGI software to track the radar visibility and signal availability between various mission assets and then employs Ansys HFSS to analyze the quality of that visibility and connectivity. Here\u2019s another example to make it more concrete. The use of simulation to plan the successful deployment of a new telecommunication satellite. First, AGI\u2019s mission and orbital simulation capabilities can help ensure that the launch and the orbit of the new satellites avoids the collision with other objects in space. Furthermore, the combination of AGI\u2019s capabilities and Ansys HFSS can simulate the relative position and communications capabilities of the satellites to other orbiting telecommunication satellites and to terrestrial base stations to help ensure that the satellite will perform as expected when deployed. We will be in a position to share more with you about our plans with AGI after the transaction closes. Before I turn the call over to Maria, I\u2019d like to discuss two important topics. The ANSYS Cloud offering, and our commitment to ESG. ANSYS Cloud, which enables our customers to access high-performance computing in the public cloud. It\u2019s critically important with so many customers continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. ANSYS Cloud is built on a close collaboration with Microsoft and its Azure platform. Today, ANSYS Cloud customers can use the majority of our mechanical, fluids and electromagnetics products on the latest and highest performance compute and networking infrastructure available in the market. Furthermore, ANSYS Cloud supports flexible consumption models, lowering the barrier to entry for customers. These include an elastic pay-as-you-go model that gives users SaaS access to ANSYS products and high performance computing infrastructure and Azure for greatest convenience.  A bring your own license model that allows customers to use their existing ANSYS lease licenses, thus preserving their existing investments, and a hybrid model that enables customers to mix and match elastic and lease licenses for greatest flexibility. The demand for ANSYS Cloud continues to increase with usage doubling in the last six months. For example, joint ANSYS Microsoft customer, Rockwell Automation is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development processes. The company has reduced simulation runtimes by 50%, enabling users to solve larger problems more accurately. Whilst, we are excited about our public cloud offering and encouraged by a rapid progress. It is important to note that the majority of our customers view ANSYS products on premises in their own data centers or in private cloud, such as the Government Agency, I mentioned earlier. As such, we expect our ANSYS Cloud offering will remain a relatively small piece of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, we are continuing to advance our environmental, social and governance programs. In Q3, we submitted our 2020 climate change report to CDP, which helps us identify our internal environmental risks and opportunities. This information is available on our Investor Relations website. We are also analyzing the benefits in environmental sustainability that our solutions enable for our customers and plan to make that information publicly available when ready. To summarize, Q3 was another strong quarter. Thanks to great execution from our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Our compelling value proposition of helping customers to decrease costs, while spurring topline growth continues to gain traction in the market. Those factors combined with our close customer relationships, the power of ANSYS products and the strength our pipeline gives us continued confidence as we work to deliver against our objectives to the remainder of 2020. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q3, as well as the details around our outlook and the assumption for the remainder of the year. Maria?\nMaria Shields: Thank you, Ajei. Hello everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by the team\u2019s ongoing focus on execution. I\u2019ll walk through an overview of the Q3 financial highlights and then add some additional qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for the final quarter of 2020. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment to again, say, thank you to the ANSYS team. As part of our efforts to keep employees safe and healthy, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the third quarter. And as we previously communicated, this will continue to be the case throughout the remainder of 2020. Our Q3 results reflect the stability of the ANSYS business model. Even in the backdrop of a prolonged global pandemic. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $369 million or constant currency revenue growth of 5% and operating margin and EPS results that were both about the high end of our Q3 guidance. Consistent with the first half of the year, our revenue in Q3 was driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the third quarter continue to be strong, with ACV of $305 million, of which 78% is coming from recurring sources. This is a new record for Q3, with respect to both total ACV and the percent that is attributable to recurring sources. Q3\u2019s results reflect the continued trends into strong lease sales that we\u2019ve been experiencing throughout 2020, with a 10% increase in lease license revenue. This combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 record total of $880 million, a 35% increase over last year\u2019s comparable balance. The solid topline results combined with our focus on fiscal discipline help to drive a third quarter gross margin of 89% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which finished above the high end of our Q3 guidance. In line with the plan that we communicated last quarter, we continue to manage our business and reduce level of discretionary spending, particularly in the category of business travel and entertainment. While we also continue to manage the business at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by 143 employees in the third quarter. The net result was third quarter EPS of a $1.36, which finished above high end of our guidance and which benefited from the combination of the solid revenue results and ongoing fiscal discipline. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5%, which is the rate that we expect for remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the third quarter with cash flow from operations that total of $94.5 million and we closed the quarter with a total of $845 million in cash and short-term investments. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current business climate. Now, let me move on to the topic of guidance. Coming off another strong finish in Q3, combined with our current outlook regarding the strengths of the pipeline of opportunities for the balance of 2020, we are increasing both the high-end and the mid-point of our ACV revenue and earnings outlook for the full year. Let me just add that we have excluded the impact of the AGI acquisition from our updated guidance, because the closing date is not certain. To the extent of the deal closes in the fourth quarter, as we expect the impact on our non-GAAP financial results will be immaterial. Now, let me move on to the specifics of our outlook. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $542 million to $582 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.67. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.610 billion to $1.650 billion or constant currency growth in a range of 5% to 7% and EPS in the range of $6.09 to $6.40. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.555 billion to $1.590 billion or constant currency ACV growth of 6% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a similar business environment in Q4 to what we experienced in Q3. That being said, we have a pipeline of enterprise customers with scheduled renewals for multi-year leases and with whom we are in active negotiation as part of their process of planning their R&D spend commitments for the remainder of the year and beyond. In line with what we\u2019ve experienced since the health crisis first began in late Q1, we expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our outlook for the remainder of the year, factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects an increase in sale and third-party commission, as we head into the largest ACV quarterly of the year. With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are maintaining our outlook for 2020 in the range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. We have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impacts of customer payments that will be delayed into 2021, because of extended payment terms negotiated on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. We\u2019re maintaining our estimate of these payments related negative impacts by 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. Our outlook on operating cash flow also takes into account, a recent unfavorable tax assessment, which we are estimating will have a negative impact of $10 million in 2020, the majority of which is expected to be recaptured in 2021\u2019s cash flow. Looking ahead to Q4, we\u2019re expecting operating margin in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%. And for the full year in line with our previous outlook, we\u2019re expecting to finish the year with industry leading operating margins in the range of 41% to 42%. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2021 guidance, once we finalize our 2021 annual planning process and close out 2020. We are very fortunate to finish Q3 with strong financial and operational results. These results are a testament to both resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the tenacity and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. In closing, we are also very excited about the pending acquisition of Analytical Graphics. As you saw in the recent press release announcing the deal, we will pay $700 million for AGI with its shareholders receiving 67% of the purchase price in cash and 33% in ANSYS common stock. We expect to finalize closing later in Q4. With respect to 2021, we expect the deal to contribute an additional $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue. And then it will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP EPS. This acquisition is yet another milestone in our continued deployment of capital to grow and expand our business and our leadership in this exciting and growing market. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi. Tyler, please proceed.\nTyler Radke: All right. Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you just a little bit more about the \u2013 your confidence level heading into Q4. It seems like from kind of the qualitative commentary are expecting somewhat of a continuation of the deal environment you saw in Q3. And if my math is right, it suggests that you\u2019re expecting to grow ACV stronger than I think mid-teens, which is stronger than you\u2019ve grown ACV and in a number of years. So maybe just talk about what\u2019s behind the confidence in such a strong Q4 forecast or the deals that got pushed out at Q3 that you expected to close in Q4. Just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline. Thank you.\nMaria Shields: Yes. So, Tyler, thank you for the questions. With respect to \u2013 I\u2019ll just comment on Q3. Q3 played out largely in line with what we had expected, no real surprises there. Q4, as we\u2019ve been saying, quite frankly, all year long, the year was going to be very back-end loaded. And that is just a result of all of the multi-year leases that are scheduled for renewal in Q4. And we have a high level of confidence based on not only what we\u2019ve been able to execute upon in the first nine months in a year, but more importantly, these are relationships with long standing customers of which we\u2019ve grown our footprint and the importance and criticality of simulation to their R&D and product life cycle. So we\u2019re highly confident and we know we\u2019ve got a great team and we\u2019ve demonstrated in the first nine months that we\u2019re able to engage with customers and to close large deals. And so that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline. We\u2019ve got good visibility into the quarter and compared to where we were in August, we\u2019ve obviously been in active conversations with a number of these customers. And so all of that is what gives us the confidence in the increased outlook that we put up this morning.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Ken, please proceed.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe \u2013 Ajei or Maria, maybe to put a final point on what\u2019s higher of asking. Just wondering, did you guys see anything in the underlying KPIs that gave you this higher confidence in terms of whether its pipeline conversion, sales cycles shortening and uptick in new business? This \u2013 from our end, with the macro still a little soft, we\u2019d just love to get a sense for kind of what you guys see internally that gives you this elevated confidence.\nMaria Shields: Yes. What I would say is, Ken, no different than what we\u2019ve seen all year. As I said, if you\u2019ve listened to the script, while we\u2019ve seen an impact in SMB and some of the new business, when it comes to these renewal, now that we\u2019ve shifted away from a perpetual model to a lease model, the reality is the customers need to make sure that we close those deals in Q4, so that they can continue to have access to the technology, that\u2019s critical to their R&D process. So it\u2019s the visibility, it\u2019s the ongoing relationship and it\u2019s the critical nature of what we provide to our customers that continue to give us confidence that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline and that Q4 is going to be \u2013 but, frankly, the largest quarter in the company\u2019s history.\nAjei Gopal: And from an operational execution perspective, just to add on to what Maria said, if you look at Q2, for example, we closed the largest deal in the history of the company, while everyone was working from home. At a time, when I think people had a much more bearish view of the situation with the coronavirus, as perhaps we\u2019re seeing in the market right now. And if you look at Q3, we just \u2013 as you heard in the comments, we announced a closing of a very large deal, the second largest in the history of the company, and once again, but people working from home. So that gives you some perspective for our ability to execute in this environment. And I\u2019d give you some perspective about the nature of the relationships that we have with a customer. And as Maria was saying, when we have these large deals, it is not just an opportunity for us to renew the existing business. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to sell more new ACV and new capabilities, and we\u2019re able to do that. And we\u2019ve demonstrated that through the year and we are \u2013 and that\u2019s the reason for our confidence in the fourth quarter.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jackson Ader of JPMorgan. Jackson, please proceed.\nJackson Ader: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up, Ajei, on the large deals, so you just mentioned, I think both of them in the second and third quarter was five-year deal. Is maybe the lengthening of contracts becoming something that you\u2019re seeing a key theme as you\u2019re getting these deals across the finish line? The backlog and combined backlog and long-term backlog and said revenue is that far more than revenue growth in the quarter? So just curious, if you\u2019re seeing lengthening contract terms from all areas of your business.\nMaria Shields: Yes. So Jackson, what I\u2019d say is, those five-year deals are still an anomaly. And what I say is, if you look at the particular customers that have decided to extend the five-year deals, some of them are already two or three cycles into these leases, these multi-year leases. And so they\u2019ve got a lot more confidence. And they also tend to be in verticals, where the product lifestyle \u2013 life cycles are much longer. And they\u2019ve been using simulation for much longer than some of the customers. So the combination of all those factors is what\u2019s really driving them to have the confidence to extend the term, so that they can plan accordingly and we can work with them on successful deployment of particularly new technologies that they\u2019re trying to roll out across their R&D teams.\nJackson Ader: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just a quick follow-up, given the election session, everybody\u2019s mind and maybe some talk about some infrastructure spending, how exposed do you guys feel that the ANSYS portfolio is to increase infrastructure spending here in the U.S.\nAjei Gopal: Well, look, I mean, I think the \u2013 what we\u2019ve given you in terms of guidance is essentially based on the view that we have into our pipeline and the forecast that we\u2019ve gotten from our team. So that\u2019s very concrete, it\u2019s not speculative based on potential directions that investment may or may not go. So we\u2019ll be giving us a very specific concrete way of thinking about our business. Obviously, if there continues to be more investment in areas where people are using more technology, more equipment that obviously translates into the tailwind for ANSYS, that\u2019s obviously the case. But we haven\u2019t factored in any hypothetical incremental investment in infrastructure for our Q4 analysis.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jason, please proceed.\nJason Celino: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The acquisition of AGI space seems to be a new frontier for you guys. But maybe can you talk about, maybe the split of recurring revenue for that business and have they any perpetual revenue or services and maybe how fast that company was growing before the upcoming acquisition. I know there\u2019s a lot of synergy, but maybe some background a little bit.\nMaria Shields: Yes. So Jason, I\u2019ll say is, it was a private company that perhaps U.S. GAAP was not exactly how they kept track of their books and records as we do as a public company. And we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time going back and trying to recreate what their GAAP results would look like. They were growing, they were profitable and absolutely, we are very excited about the opportunity to extend our presence in aerospace and defense. Particularly, as you think about, over the course of the next decade, we are lot of that spend is going to be coming from. I mean, the amount of investment that the private sector is putting into space is incredible and satellites and all of these mission critical systems, where the synergy between the technology that AGI has and our technology as demonstrated from the early successes we saw in our partnership. We\u2019re very excited about the long-term opportunity to marry that business with the ANSYS business and to expand our presence in that important and growing vertical.\nJason Celino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. Gal, please proceed.\nGal Munda: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I thought one, it was just kind of a follow-up on the deals that you\u2019re reviewing over the next quarter and the next few years. Can you just talk to us a little bit about the potential, when you negotiate these deals, how did they work hard in terms of the land and in terms of the uplift that you\u2019re seeing, maybe you can talk us for kind of a typical deal, if that \u2013 if such things exist? And are they linear in terms of spend? Or are you seeing kind of a ramp progression as clients expect to use more of your portfolio over time when the kind of larger contract is signed? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all that you can really apply to these deals, especially when you\u2019re dealing with larger customers, using multiple product lines. A lot of the opportunity within the account depends on the nature of the programs that customers have. In some cases, they have activities or programs where they\u2019re using simulation, and you can really see the growth of the use of simulation, and that\u2019s kind of factored into the way the deal is structured. And in some cases, in a multi-year deal. And in some cases, you\u2019ll see the desire not just to increase the number of users, but maybe to bring on a new technology and start to work and add a new technology capability to that. So it really \u2013 there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. But what we try to do when we sit down with our customers and work through the details of a multi-year deal is to really understand the demand dynamics within the customer. We usually have a pretty good sense of where the usage is. What they\u2019d like to try to accomplish, map that against our capabilities, and then that\u2019s how we find the basis of a conversation in the agreement.\nGal Munda: Got you. So just to kind of follow-up on that. Do you think that when you sign $70 million or $100 million deal, is that \u2013 is it a linear kind of expense? Or does it have the ACV itself doesn\u2019t just average out over the years because of the fact that they might be ramping up more over the years when you expect more users to come onboard, is that a fair assumption?\nAjei Gopal: I think, as I said, there\u2019s nothing that we can give you that that\u2019s standard for every single deal. It will vary on a deal-by-deal basis. And so the objective \u2013 our objective is to make sure that we can satisfy our customers\u2019 needs by getting them as much technology as they can take advantage of. And in many cases, you\u2019ll see customer usage varying on programs, and in some cases, wrapping up. And so that\u2019s really reflected in this. I cannot tell you on a one-size-fits-all because it\u2019s very bespoke on a case-by-case basis.\nGal Munda: Thank you, Ajei. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Jay, please proceed.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, starting with you a technology question, stemming from your conference back in June Simulation World and then more recently, the Semiconductor Conference. And then tying that into the AGI acquisition, so there were a number of reference is your events that got my attention, having to do with what we described as ANSYS domain-specific applications and industry solutions. And so the question is, should we expect more and more over time, more explicit dedicated domain- applications or industry solutions as commented on at your conferences? And then tying that into AGI, you use the interesting phrase that it\u2019s purpose built. And I\u2019m wondering if there might be some more earthbound applications rather than just space, for example, wouldn\u2019t autonomous vehicles have the same use cases, let\u2019s say, satellites in terms of interactions and controlling missions and the like. And then just from where we \u2013 going back to your hiring comments, what catalysts or conditions would you need to see to widen that aperture back open some more? I mean, right now, you\u2019re running in terms of your openings, around 3% of headcount, you\u2019ve typically been 5% or more of your headcount in open rec, so what do you need to see before you open that up some more?\nAjei Gopal: Okay. So let me start, Jay, with the first part of your question, let me start with that one. Look, you\u2019re absolutely right to observe that. We have been able to bring integrated multi-physics capabilities to market to address the needs of our customers. We\u2019ve talked about 5G, we\u2019ve talked about electrification. These are all capabilities that require multiple physics working together, a true multi-physics capability with a workflow and integrated data flow and automation that goes with that. Rotating machinery, for example, there are many examples that we can point to. The infrastructure that we\u2019ve built within our portfolio not only the world class solvers and physics capabilities that we have with the infrastructure that we\u2019ve built with Minerva, with our platform capabilities around [indiscernible] and so forth, have all given us the ability to much more effectively and rapidly integrate these solutions or these technologies together to address the needs of customers. And so you\u2019re starting to see some of these domain-specific solutions being made available because it\u2019s so much easier to be able to integrate our technologies together to create this multi-physics capability. So absolutely, you should see more of that. The side effect of that is it becomes easier to integrate active acquired technologies into our portfolio as well. The second part of your question was, you made the observation that mission simulation and connecting that with component level and system-level simulation, you made the observation that there may be other use cases other than space and satellite. And the answer, of course, is there\u2019s certainly other use cases that one could imagine, telecommunications, for example, 5G infrastructure, you mentioned autonomous vehicles, these are all potential future opportunities that we would have to export to evaluate whether those would be opportunities for us to engage with.\nMaria Shields: And Jay, with respect to the hiring comments, what I\u2019d say is as you know, we\u2019ve reduced our planned spend early in the year when the pandemic began to impact the business. And with the recent extended lockdowns in EMEA, in certain parts of the United States, we just think there\u2019s still enough volatility and uncertainty that it makes more sense for us to continue to be prudent in our hiring and in other things that are not critical to the long-term success of the business. And additionally, as we think about Q4, our plans are to go ahead and close AGI, which will add a couple of hundred new employees into the ANSYS family. So I would think much more certainty around the pace of recovery in the overall global economy would make us much more comfortable to perhaps return to a more rapid pace of investments, as you saw perhaps in 2018 or 2019. But right now, I think it\u2019s a little bit too early for us to pull the trigger on more increased investments, particularly in the hiring front, given that, that\u2019s 70% of our spend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Borg of Stifel. Adam, please proceed.\nAdam Borg: Hey guys, and thanks for taking the question. Just on the ANSYS Cloud, it seems like your recent partnership announcement with Microsoft was a nice expansion. I guess I\u2019m thinking in terms of the new physics as well as the go-to-market offerings or the joint go-to-market efforts. I\u2019m just curious, are there any technical limitations to bringing the rest of your simulation portfolio over to ANSYS Cloud? I know, Ajei, you mentioned you\u2019ve continued to expand. Are there any limitation, bringing the rest of it over? And I guess as a follow-up, are our customers asking about ANSYS Cloud-like offering that may run on top of AWS or GCP, just given their unique needs? Thanks so much.\nAjei Gopal: Firstly, we have customers who are using ANSYS technology on multiple hyperscaler infrastructures. And that\u2019s the reality of the situation today. The ANSYS Cloud offering per se, the one that we take to market is running on top of Azure. And there really isn\u2019t any fundamental restriction on the capabilities that we could make available on ANSYS Cloud. We have our flagships on ANSYS Cloud, and we will continue to add capabilities to that \u2013 to the cloud offering as it makes sense. So it\u2019s \u2013 you should look to us to continue to make investments in ANSYS Cloud, you should look to more capabilities in there. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that, as I\u2019ve explained in my comments, we have to be cognizant of the fact that our customers, for the most part, are still running on-premises in their own data centers or in private clouds. And our objective is to make sure that our technology is there. It\u2019s available and ready to go. And as and when the customers are ready, we\u2019re able to support them with ANSYS Cloud.\nAdam Borg: That\u2019s great. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Maria. Just a bit of housekeeping. Could you just comment \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but could you comment on the inorganic contribution from both revenue and ACV, not just for this quarter but expectations for 4Q? Thanks so much.\nMaria Shields: Yes. So for Q3 in the first nine months, it\u2019s about 6%, and for the full year, Adam, it\u2019s about 5%.\nAdam Borg: Excellent, thank you. Thanks, again.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is going to come from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Saket, please proceed.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey, thanks for taking my questions here guys. Most of mine have been answered, but maybe for you, Maria, just off to the last question. Good to see that increase in ACV versus the prior guide you provided last quarter. Can you just remind us how much of that increase is coming from changes in FX recently? And maybe just also remind us what the new ACV guide reflects in terms of organic constant currency growth?\nMaria Shields: Yes. So Saket, what I would say is currency did not play a factor in our increasing our outlook for the key metrics that we were able to increase. The rate are basically within the ranges that we used when we guided in August. It\u2019s really the increased visibility and strength of the pipeline that were the underlying factor in our deciding to go ahead and increase our outlook now that we are actually in Q4 and have much greater insight into the likelihood and probability of those deals closing. And for the full year, inorganic contribution was 5%.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMaria Shields: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over for any closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, operator. As I think about the remainder of the year, I\u2019m excited by our continued execution, our diverse customer base and our strong pipeline. Our customers continue to rely on simulation and our ability to close large deals remotely only adds to that excitement and confidence. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their continued support. And a special thank you to my ANSYS colleagues around the world, your work continues to inspire. You have my gratitude for delivering another strong quarter. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Please enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maria Shields",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Hello everyone. We\u2019re very pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by the team\u2019s ongoing focus on execution. I\u2019ll walk through an overview of the Q3 financial highlights and then add some additional qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for the final quarter of 2020. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment to again, say, thank you to the ANSYS team. As part of our efforts to keep employees safe and healthy, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the third quarter. And as we previously communicated, this will continue to be the case throughout the remainder of 2020. Our Q3 results reflect the stability of the ANSYS business model. Even in the backdrop of a prolonged global pandemic. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $369 million or constant currency revenue growth of 5% and operating margin and EPS results that were both about the high end of our Q3 guidance. Consistent with the first half of the year, our revenue in Q3 was driven by solid sales execution. Other key financial metrics for the third quarter continue to be strong, with ACV of $305 million, of which 78% is coming from recurring sources. This is a new record for Q3, with respect to both total ACV and the percent that is attributable to recurring sources. Q3\u2019s results reflect the continued trends into strong lease sales that we\u2019ve been experiencing throughout 2020, with a 10% increase in lease license revenue. This combined with high renewal rates on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q3 record total of $880 million, a 35% increase over last year\u2019s comparable balance. The solid topline results combined with our focus on fiscal discipline help to drive a third quarter gross margin of 89% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which finished above the high end of our Q3 guidance. In line with the plan that we communicated last quarter, we continue to manage our business and reduce level of discretionary spending, particularly in the category of business travel and entertainment. While we also continue to manage the business at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by 143 employees in the third quarter. The net result was third quarter EPS of a $1.36, which finished above high end of our guidance and which benefited from the combination of the solid revenue results and ongoing fiscal discipline. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19.5%, which is the rate that we expect for remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the third quarter with cash flow from operations that total of $94.5 million and we closed the quarter with a total of $845 million in cash and short-term investments. We remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current business climate. Now, let me move on to the topic of guidance. Coming off another strong finish in Q3, combined with our current outlook regarding the strengths of the pipeline of opportunities for the balance of 2020, we are increasing both the high-end and the mid-point of our ACV revenue and earnings outlook for the full year. Let me just add that we have excluded the impact of the AGI acquisition from our updated guidance, because the closing date is not certain. To the extent of the deal closes in the fourth quarter, as we expect the impact on our non-GAAP financial results will be immaterial. Now, let me move on to the specifics of our outlook. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $542 million to $582 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.67. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.610 billion to $1.650 billion or constant currency growth in a range of 5% to 7% and EPS in the range of $6.09 to $6.40. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.555 billion to $1.590 billion or constant currency ACV growth of 6% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a similar business environment in Q4 to what we experienced in Q3. That being said, we have a pipeline of enterprise customers with scheduled renewals for multi-year leases and with whom we are in active negotiation as part of their process of planning their R&D spend commitments for the remainder of the year and beyond. In line with what we\u2019ve experienced since the health crisis first began in late Q1, we expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our outlook for the remainder of the year, factors in everything that we are currently aware of with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects an increase in sale and third-party commission, as we head into the largest ACV quarterly of the year. With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are maintaining our outlook for 2020 in the range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. We have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impacts of customer payments that will be delayed into 2021, because of extended payment terms negotiated on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. We\u2019re maintaining our estimate of these payments related negative impacts by 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. Our outlook on operating cash flow also takes into account, a recent unfavorable tax assessment, which we are estimating will have a negative impact of $10 million in 2020, the majority of which is expected to be recaptured in 2021\u2019s cash flow. Looking ahead to Q4, we\u2019re expecting operating margin in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%. And for the full year in line with our previous outlook, we\u2019re expecting to finish the year with industry leading operating margins in the range of 41% to 42%. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q4 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2021 guidance, once we finalize our 2021 annual planning process and close out 2020. We are very fortunate to finish Q3 with strong financial and operational results. These results are a testament to both resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the tenacity and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. In closing, we are also very excited about the pending acquisition of Analytical Graphics. As you saw in the recent press release announcing the deal, we will pay $700 million for AGI with its shareholders receiving 67% of the purchase price in cash and 33% in ANSYS common stock. We expect to finalize closing later in Q4. With respect to 2021, we expect the deal to contribute an additional $75 million to $85 million of non-GAAP revenue. And then it will be modestly accretive to non-GAAP EPS. This acquisition is yet another milestone in our continued deployment of capital to grow and expand our business and our leadership in this exciting and growing market. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to open the call for questions. Yes. So, Tyler, thank you for the questions. With respect to \u2013 I\u2019ll just comment on Q3. Q3 played out largely in line with what we had expected, no real surprises there. Q4, as we\u2019ve been saying, quite frankly, all year long, the year was going to be very back-end loaded. And that is just a result of all of the multi-year leases that are scheduled for renewal in Q4. And we have a high level of confidence based on not only what we\u2019ve been able to execute upon in the first nine months in a year, but more importantly, these are relationships with long standing customers of which we\u2019ve grown our footprint and the importance and criticality of simulation to their R&D and product life cycle. So we\u2019re highly confident and we know we\u2019ve got a great team and we\u2019ve demonstrated in the first nine months that we\u2019re able to engage with customers and to close large deals. And so that\u2019s what gives us the confidence that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline. We\u2019ve got good visibility into the quarter and compared to where we were in August, we\u2019ve obviously been in active conversations with a number of these customers. And so all of that is what gives us the confidence in the increased outlook that we put up this morning. Yes. What I would say is, Ken, no different than what we\u2019ve seen all year. As I said, if you\u2019ve listened to the script, while we\u2019ve seen an impact in SMB and some of the new business, when it comes to these renewal, now that we\u2019ve shifted away from a perpetual model to a lease model, the reality is the customers need to make sure that we close those deals in Q4, so that they can continue to have access to the technology, that\u2019s critical to their R&D process. So it\u2019s the visibility, it\u2019s the ongoing relationship and it\u2019s the critical nature of what we provide to our customers that continue to give us confidence that we\u2019ve got a strong pipeline and that Q4 is going to be \u2013 but, frankly, the largest quarter in the company\u2019s history. Yes. So Jackson, what I\u2019d say is, those five-year deals are still an anomaly. And what I say is, if you look at the particular customers that have decided to extend the five-year deals, some of them are already two or three cycles into these leases, these multi-year leases. And so they\u2019ve got a lot more confidence. And they also tend to be in verticals, where the product lifestyle \u2013 life cycles are much longer. And they\u2019ve been using simulation for much longer than some of the customers. So the combination of all those factors is what\u2019s really driving them to have the confidence to extend the term, so that they can plan accordingly and we can work with them on successful deployment of particularly new technologies that they\u2019re trying to roll out across their R&D teams. Yes. So Jason, I\u2019ll say is, it was a private company that perhaps U.S. GAAP was not exactly how they kept track of their books and records as we do as a public company. And we didn\u2019t spend a lot of time going back and trying to recreate what their GAAP results would look like. They were growing, they were profitable and absolutely, we are very excited about the opportunity to extend our presence in aerospace and defense. Particularly, as you think about, over the course of the next decade, we are lot of that spend is going to be coming from. I mean, the amount of investment that the private sector is putting into space is incredible and satellites and all of these mission critical systems, where the synergy between the technology that AGI has and our technology as demonstrated from the early successes we saw in our partnership. We\u2019re very excited about the long-term opportunity to marry that business with the ANSYS business and to expand our presence in that important and growing vertical. And Jay, with respect to the hiring comments, what I\u2019d say is as you know, we\u2019ve reduced our planned spend early in the year when the pandemic began to impact the business. And with the recent extended lockdowns in EMEA, in certain parts of the United States, we just think there\u2019s still enough volatility and uncertainty that it makes more sense for us to continue to be prudent in our hiring and in other things that are not critical to the long-term success of the business. And additionally, as we think about Q4, our plans are to go ahead and close AGI, which will add a couple of hundred new employees into the ANSYS family. So I would think much more certainty around the pace of recovery in the overall global economy would make us much more comfortable to perhaps return to a more rapid pace of investments, as you saw perhaps in 2018 or 2019. But right now, I think it\u2019s a little bit too early for us to pull the trigger on more increased investments, particularly in the hiring front, given that, that\u2019s 70% of our spend. Yes. So for Q3 in the first nine months, it\u2019s about 6%, and for the full year, Adam, it\u2019s about 5%. Yes. So Saket, what I would say is currency did not play a factor in our increasing our outlook for the key metrics that we were able to increase. The rate are basically within the ranges that we used when we guided in August. It\u2019s really the increased visibility and strength of the pipeline that were the underlying factor in our deciding to go ahead and increase our outlook now that we are actually in Q4 and have much greater insight into the likelihood and probability of those deals closing. And for the full year, inorganic contribution was 5%. Thank you."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another strong quarter for ANSYS meeting or beating our financial guidance on all key metrics. Our performance demonstrates that our core value proposition of helping organizations increase that top line, while driving bottom line savings continues to resonate with the market. I\u2019m excited that the demand for ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics solutions is strong and growing. And it\u2019s furthering a strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle. Based on our year-to-date performance and the strength of our pipeline for the fourth quarter, we are increasing both the high-end and the midpoint of our 2020 guidance for ACV revenue and EPS. Maria will have the details in a few minutes. Our prepared remarks document has details about the quarter, but let me provide some regional perspective. We anticipate that the Americas will be our strongest region for the full year. From a quarterly perspective, Asia-Pacific was strong in Q3 with Japan leading the way, reflecting our ongoing progress towards multi-physics multi-year lease deals. We expect EMEA to show a good growth in Q4 driven by the timing of larger deals. During Q3, our enterprise and strategic account program continue to show strength with approximately 50% of our Q3 ACV coming from our top 100 customers. I\u2019m excited that we closed a five-year $72 million lease with a North American enterprise customer, our largest agreement in the quarter and the second largest in the history of the company. This deal results in ACV and revenue in Q3 and primarily in Q4 and comes after the almost $100 million sale that we announced last quarter. We still continued headwinds this quarter with small and medium businesses across geographies, consistent with what we have previously communicated. From an industry point of view, the high-tech, automotive and ground transportation, and aerospace and defense sectors continue to be our strongest performance for the full year. On our past calls, I have given some additional color around particular aspects of our business. Today, I will discuss our successes in the aerospace and defense vertical. A&D is ANSYS\u2019 second largest sector at about 18% of our trailing 12 months ACV. Although, the pandemic has impacted commercial air travel, we continue to see spending in the sector thanks to important strategic initiatives. These include eco-friendly fuel-efficient engines, Space 2.0 initiatives such as rocket design and satellite deployments and national defense. I would like to highlight two important Q3 deals in which companies will use ANSYS simulation to develop eco-friendly or aircraft engines. These companies are relying on ANSYS to improve engine efficiency, reduce engine weight, and avoid fuel inefficient over design. The first agreement was with Honeywell, which is using ANSYS simulation to automate its engineering workflows to maximize operational efficiency and drive process improvements. As a result, Honeywell will benefit from product wide traceability and reusability, while significantly cutting development cycle times. The second was with a major aircraft engine manufacturer that is investing $34 million over the next five years to standardize on ANSYS to achieve its vision of developing next generation engines at lower costs. Space 2.0 companies are democratizing space by launching satellites and astronauts into orbit. And they are embracing the use of simulation to develop better products and to make smarter decisions faster. Firefly Aerospace, one of the more than 1,000 companies that have benefited from the ANSYS startup program recently announced that it has realized about $15 million in savings from using our simulation for critical tasks leading to a design that can withstand the extreme conditions of liftoff flight and space travel. We are seeing ongoing investments in multi-physics simulation by government agencies and defense contractors, which are trying to solve next generation problems in the interest of national security. These organizations are turning to ANSYS, because of our simulation leadership and advanced multi-physics capabilities. In Q3, we saw investment from a large North American defense contractor for the design of an advanced aircraft optical sensor. To help calibrate sensor algorithms to reduce noise and blurriness due to high speed air flow, our team developed and deployed a fully coupled arrow optical solution. This competitive win was possible not only because of ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics leadership, but also because of the unparalleled accuracy of our products. ANSYS simulations eliminated eight weeks of testing for the company lowering test costs by 60% and increasing engineering productivity by up to 15% using the new workflow. We signed another multimillion dollar Q3 deal this time with a government agency to use ANSYS to design chips that are more secure. This organization is relying on an important multi-physics breakthrough by ANSYS R&D, in which simulation can be used to help chip design as prevent hard to detect side channel attacks, specifically the new ANSYS offering, which is deployed and runs on the customers secure private cloud, enables chip and system designers to simulate and measure their vulnerability to security attacks while the chip is being designed. As an aside, this organization was amongst the first customers to serve the needs of its users and prime contractors using an ANSYS private cloud that is ANSYS products deployed and running on a shared secured infrastructure. Let me move from customers to acquisitions. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire AGI a pioneer and leader in the analysis and simulation of missions, such as satellite launches, national defense and search and rescue operations. ANSYS has not traditionally participated in this area, which is growing due to the increasing number of missions. Historically, customer needs were partially addressed by commercial software with multiple applications all by in-house codes. AGI has a purpose built solution for mission analysis and simulation, and has become a leading firm in this area. By combining forces with AGI, we will be able to address a broader opportunity called digital mission engineering, which combines mission simulation and analysis from AGI and components and system level simulation from ANSYS. Our combined portfolio will enable customers to simulate up and down the stack, starting at the chip level and going all the way up to the customer\u2019s entire mission, thereby increasing the likelihood of success and saving customers\u2019 time, money, and other crucial resources. You may remember that we formed a partnership with AGI last year. And one of the results of that alliance with the connection between its products and Ansys HFSS our flagship electromagnetic solver. Several large customers are using both companies\u2019 products together. One large prime contractor, for example, uses AGI software to track the radar visibility and signal availability between various mission assets and then employs Ansys HFSS to analyze the quality of that visibility and connectivity. Here\u2019s another example to make it more concrete. The use of simulation to plan the successful deployment of a new telecommunication satellite. First, AGI\u2019s mission and orbital simulation capabilities can help ensure that the launch and the orbit of the new satellites avoids the collision with other objects in space. Furthermore, the combination of AGI\u2019s capabilities and Ansys HFSS can simulate the relative position and communications capabilities of the satellites to other orbiting telecommunication satellites and to terrestrial base stations to help ensure that the satellite will perform as expected when deployed. We will be in a position to share more with you about our plans with AGI after the transaction closes. Before I turn the call over to Maria, I\u2019d like to discuss two important topics. The ANSYS Cloud offering, and our commitment to ESG. ANSYS Cloud, which enables our customers to access high-performance computing in the public cloud. It\u2019s critically important with so many customers continuing to work remotely during the pandemic. ANSYS Cloud is built on a close collaboration with Microsoft and its Azure platform. Today, ANSYS Cloud customers can use the majority of our mechanical, fluids and electromagnetics products on the latest and highest performance compute and networking infrastructure available in the market. Furthermore, ANSYS Cloud supports flexible consumption models, lowering the barrier to entry for customers. These include an elastic pay-as-you-go model that gives users SaaS access to ANSYS products and high performance computing infrastructure and Azure for greatest convenience.  A bring your own license model that allows customers to use their existing ANSYS lease licenses, thus preserving their existing investments, and a hybrid model that enables customers to mix and match elastic and lease licenses for greatest flexibility. The demand for ANSYS Cloud continues to increase with usage doubling in the last six months. For example, joint ANSYS Microsoft customer, Rockwell Automation is using ANSYS Cloud to accelerate its product development processes. The company has reduced simulation runtimes by 50%, enabling users to solve larger problems more accurately. Whilst, we are excited about our public cloud offering and encouraged by a rapid progress. It is important to note that the majority of our customers view ANSYS products on premises in their own data centers or in private cloud, such as the Government Agency, I mentioned earlier. As such, we expect our ANSYS Cloud offering will remain a relatively small piece of our business for the foreseeable future. Finally, we are continuing to advance our environmental, social and governance programs. In Q3, we submitted our 2020 climate change report to CDP, which helps us identify our internal environmental risks and opportunities. This information is available on our Investor Relations website. We are also analyzing the benefits in environmental sustainability that our solutions enable for our customers and plan to make that information publicly available when ready. To summarize, Q3 was another strong quarter. Thanks to great execution from our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Our compelling value proposition of helping customers to decrease costs, while spurring topline growth continues to gain traction in the market. Those factors combined with our close customer relationships, the power of ANSYS products and the strength our pipeline gives us continued confidence as we work to deliver against our objectives to the remainder of 2020. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q3, as well as the details around our outlook and the assumption for the remainder of the year. Maria? And from an operational execution perspective, just to add on to what Maria said, if you look at Q2, for example, we closed the largest deal in the history of the company, while everyone was working from home. At a time, when I think people had a much more bearish view of the situation with the coronavirus, as perhaps we\u2019re seeing in the market right now. And if you look at Q3, we just \u2013 as you heard in the comments, we announced a closing of a very large deal, the second largest in the history of the company, and once again, but people working from home. So that gives you some perspective for our ability to execute in this environment. And I\u2019d give you some perspective about the nature of the relationships that we have with a customer. And as Maria was saying, when we have these large deals, it is not just an opportunity for us to renew the existing business. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to sell more new ACV and new capabilities, and we\u2019re able to do that. And we\u2019ve demonstrated that through the year and we are \u2013 and that\u2019s the reason for our confidence in the fourth quarter. Well, look, I mean, I think the \u2013 what we\u2019ve given you in terms of guidance is essentially based on the view that we have into our pipeline and the forecast that we\u2019ve gotten from our team. So that\u2019s very concrete, it\u2019s not speculative based on potential directions that investment may or may not go. So we\u2019ll be giving us a very specific concrete way of thinking about our business. Obviously, if there continues to be more investment in areas where people are using more technology, more equipment that obviously translates into the tailwind for ANSYS, that\u2019s obviously the case. But we haven\u2019t factored in any hypothetical incremental investment in infrastructure for our Q4 analysis. Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all that you can really apply to these deals, especially when you\u2019re dealing with larger customers, using multiple product lines. A lot of the opportunity within the account depends on the nature of the programs that customers have. In some cases, they have activities or programs where they\u2019re using simulation, and you can really see the growth of the use of simulation, and that\u2019s kind of factored into the way the deal is structured. And in some cases, in a multi-year deal. And in some cases, you\u2019ll see the desire not just to increase the number of users, but maybe to bring on a new technology and start to work and add a new technology capability to that. So it really \u2013 there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all. But what we try to do when we sit down with our customers and work through the details of a multi-year deal is to really understand the demand dynamics within the customer. We usually have a pretty good sense of where the usage is. What they\u2019d like to try to accomplish, map that against our capabilities, and then that\u2019s how we find the basis of a conversation in the agreement. I think, as I said, there\u2019s nothing that we can give you that that\u2019s standard for every single deal. It will vary on a deal-by-deal basis. And so the objective \u2013 our objective is to make sure that we can satisfy our customers\u2019 needs by getting them as much technology as they can take advantage of. And in many cases, you\u2019ll see customer usage varying on programs, and in some cases, wrapping up. And so that\u2019s really reflected in this. I cannot tell you on a one-size-fits-all because it\u2019s very bespoke on a case-by-case basis. Okay. So let me start, Jay, with the first part of your question, let me start with that one. Look, you\u2019re absolutely right to observe that. We have been able to bring integrated multi-physics capabilities to market to address the needs of our customers. We\u2019ve talked about 5G, we\u2019ve talked about electrification. These are all capabilities that require multiple physics working together, a true multi-physics capability with a workflow and integrated data flow and automation that goes with that. Rotating machinery, for example, there are many examples that we can point to. The infrastructure that we\u2019ve built within our portfolio not only the world class solvers and physics capabilities that we have with the infrastructure that we\u2019ve built with Minerva, with our platform capabilities around [indiscernible] and so forth, have all given us the ability to much more effectively and rapidly integrate these solutions or these technologies together to address the needs of customers. And so you\u2019re starting to see some of these domain-specific solutions being made available because it\u2019s so much easier to be able to integrate our technologies together to create this multi-physics capability. So absolutely, you should see more of that. The side effect of that is it becomes easier to integrate active acquired technologies into our portfolio as well. The second part of your question was, you made the observation that mission simulation and connecting that with component level and system-level simulation, you made the observation that there may be other use cases other than space and satellite. And the answer, of course, is there\u2019s certainly other use cases that one could imagine, telecommunications, for example, 5G infrastructure, you mentioned autonomous vehicles, these are all potential future opportunities that we would have to export to evaluate whether those would be opportunities for us to engage with. Firstly, we have customers who are using ANSYS technology on multiple hyperscaler infrastructures. And that\u2019s the reality of the situation today. The ANSYS Cloud offering per se, the one that we take to market is running on top of Azure. And there really isn\u2019t any fundamental restriction on the capabilities that we could make available on ANSYS Cloud. We have our flagships on ANSYS Cloud, and we will continue to add capabilities to that \u2013 to the cloud offering as it makes sense. So it\u2019s \u2013 you should look to us to continue to make investments in ANSYS Cloud, you should look to more capabilities in there. But we have to be cognizant of the fact that, as I\u2019ve explained in my comments, we have to be cognizant of the fact that our customers, for the most part, are still running on-premises in their own data centers or in private clouds. And our objective is to make sure that our technology is there. It\u2019s available and ready to go. And as and when the customers are ready, we\u2019re able to support them with ANSYS Cloud. Thank you, operator. As I think about the remainder of the year, I\u2019m excited by our continued execution, our diverse customer base and our strong pipeline. Our customers continue to rely on simulation and our ability to close large deals remotely only adds to that excitement and confidence. In closing, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their continued support. And a special thank you to my ANSYS colleagues around the world, your work continues to inspire. You have my gratitude for delivering another strong quarter. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Please enjoy the rest of the day."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, Chief Executive Officer; Maria Shields, SVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Annette Arribas, Senior Director, Global Investor Relations. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Arribas for some opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nAnnette Arribas: Good morning everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document, and the link to our second quarter Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q3 and updated fiscal year 2020 outlook, and the key underlying qualitative and quantitative assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC all of which are also available via our website. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum. During this call and in the prepared remarks, we'll be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures is included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei? \nAjei Gopal: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. That included two notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on ANSYS solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification, and digital twin to develop great products faster and more affordably. Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electromagnetics and LS-DYNA for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement with a major high-tech company had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance. Turning to our performance by industries, Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security. For example, in Q2, we closed a seven-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulations for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia Tier 1 automotive supplier DENSO signed a three-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy. Our Q2 performance by geography was as we expected with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers with a number of them due to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate for those leases and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call. Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulations and the key component of R&D a force multiplier that helps them drive both top-line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers making simulations even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access to corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. For example our customer Coca-Cola is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulations making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural Simulation World virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulations to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies such as Ferrari, HPE, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS simulation to develop their next-generation products. They also heard from our partners including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation World demonstrated the power of digital transformation and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers' digital transformation is successful. Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance to reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes. Moving to our product successes. We recently released ANSYS 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity fade and cell life in Fluent; integration of solver capabilities from LS-DYNA into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation, while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution RedHawk-SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over one billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing. As part of our ANSYS 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution ANSYS Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality. Our partner PTC has embedded Discovery into CAD solution Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced the closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals. As the product continues to build momentum PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and Lendlease to form the Digital Twin Consortium. Physics-based digital twin technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries. Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels Fast Company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, Fast Company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve. Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behaviour of light within complex photonic devices structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics. Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe our channel partner DYNAmore inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS-DYNA as the product of choice for crash safety analysis. This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. Finally I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's Best Places to Work by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter highlighted by great execution across the board thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties our customers know that ANSYS' simulation technologies help them solve their most vexing product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS simulation will position them for future growth and market success. Our ability to close business and to support our customers even if they work remotely gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria? \nMaria Shields: Thank you, Ajei. Hello everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020. We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times. Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million or constant currency revenue growth of 6% and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. As Ajei mentioned earlier the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results and the strength of our sales pipeline give us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment. Key financial metrics for the quarter continue with Q2, ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6% with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020. The strong top line results combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43% which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continued to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020 at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2 which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1. The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55 which also finished above the high end of our guidance and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue. With respect to taxes our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment. As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, we elected to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions in determining when might be the most opportune time to consider reinstating future share repurchases. While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about our business for the second half. During our last call, Ajei discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we progressed through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans factoring in both new data as it becomes available and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market. Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020, but with ranges that are wider than those historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty. To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue earnings ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment. Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May. Starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment that is similar to or marginally better than Q2 as many customers have not resumed full operations and employees continue to work from how. We also continue to expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter buoyed by the pipeline for multi-year leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of, with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third party commissions. With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently we are increasing our estimates of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower pace of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long-term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We are striving to be as transparent as we can and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold late in the first quarter. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us. In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the two milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow, all contributed to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer term vision of making simulation pervasive. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hello, everyone. Hope you're all doing well. I wanted to dig in to the ACV forecast for the remainder of the year, because the 3Q and 4Q does imply an acceleration in growth. And I'm just wondering, it sounds like renewals and continuing the success of the renewal rates you've seen already that plays a big factor at the same time in thinking about the ability to sign milestone deals in the type of environment we've been in. That sounds maybe better than I would have thought three months ago. So I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more colour on the scenario analysis. And if you do end up at/or above the high end of expectations what are maybe some of the reasons for that as we think about the year playing out?\nMaria Shields: Yes. So Joe let me start off by saying, if you look at the guide for the remainder of the year and second half and in line with some of the comments that Ajei and I made around how Q2 had played out, if you look at the overperformance in Q2 right, influenced by two milestone deals and in particular the one paid-up deal that contributed about $10 million to paid up that was originally scheduled for Q3 that came into Q2. So our outlook on the full year hasn't really changed. But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to you back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV to take into account what's happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2 during the height of the pandemic continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals. So at this point, I don't think we're ready to start talking about upside. I think we're just ready to talk about the confidence that we have in the outlook that we've put out there today.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question on the hiring and the pace of it. I know you've added 170 employees in June. I was just wondering in terms of how is that going relative to your pre-pandemic plans? And how is that potentially impacting your midterm growth plans?\nMaria Shields: So Andrew, relative to the 170, let me just highlight that was the higher end during all of Q2 not just in June. And that did include 58 of the employees that we brought on board in April through the Lumerical acquisition. We are on pace against our reduced hiring plan that we spoke about in May. And we're continuing to operate the business against that reduced plan just in light of the fact that the COVID situation is going on much longer than we had anticipated when we had these conversations back in May. But we are continuing to hire and we are continuing to invest because we believe that when this turns, we are going to be in an even stronger situation given the importance of simulation and the role that it plays in mission-critical R&D within our customers. So we don't want to stop investing albeit, we are investing at a slower pace and very much in line with the scenarios that we had created back in May when we have realigned all of our business plans for the remainder of the year.\nAjei Gopal: And just to add a little bit more colour on the recruiting, we are hiring people of course across the company. You saw as Maria said with Lumerical, we got a number of R&D, very skilled executive -- employees who joined the company. And we've also been recruiting in our ACE organization and our shared services team. So, we're really recruiting across all of the different functions in the areas -- the strategic areas that we have talked about in the past. And so we're continuing to execute against the longer-term plans that we've put in place and that we've discussed with you earlier.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJackson Ader: First one is on the -- how we square the idea of the largest deal in the company's history coming from automotive and ground transportation, where that also seems to be what you guys have mentioned to be the weakest segment in terms of people asking for payment extensions. And so yes, just any colour you can give on how we rationalize the strength in this one giant deal with maybe the weakness around them?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I think its -- Jackson, it goes to the point that I've been making all along. As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades very deep relationships with our customers and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. And even as we're seeing in certain parts of the economy and certainly automotive is a great example where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns and you're seeing shutdowns in plants. What's really important to recognize and certainly automotive companies recognize as well is that, as we come out of the pandemic investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. And so, that's it. It's a commitment to R&D. It's a commitment to the long-term success of their business. And it's a recognition that simulation what we provide is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier, as I said in my comments. It's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. The other thing is, I think that, when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behaviour of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behaviour of a product. And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation or the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please, go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Hey. Thank you and good morning, everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit about the SMB segment. I think you referenced some headwinds there, as it relates to payment terms and potentially churn. But could you just remind us how big the SMB segment is? And what kind of your expectations are there, in terms of timing of when you start to see improvements? Thank you.\nMaria Shields: Yes. So, with respect to SMB, it's about a-third of our business, Tyler. And a lot of that business is covered by our channel partners. And if you look at the reduction in our plans since COVID began, about 75% of the reduction comes from the SMB space. And you're also seeing that in the decline in the perpetual business, which is largely attributable to that space as well. We are not factoring in into our outlook, for the remainder of the year, any significant recovery in that space. We think it's going to take longer, just given that they are not as well capitalized and don't have the same liquidity that our enterprise customers do. And so, what we're doing, we are trying to help our customers and our channel partners through these very challenging times, because as we discovered in 2008 and 2009, when you go through difficult times, you're able to create very strong relationships that then you can build off for the next decade. And so we want to continue that practice, because it's important that we maintain those relationships. And so, we're doing everything that we can relative to helping from a cash flow perspective, extending payment terms. And as you saw we went ahead and increased our outlook relative to the amount of 2020 cash flow that will be impacted where we will see payments shift into 2021 as we help our customers and our channel partners through these challenging times. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please, go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. With respect to the largest deal in the company's history and -- which by the way, based on the number you've shared, is one of the largest deals in all of technical software to date. Perhaps we could talk a little bit about the ingredients of that? In other words, could you speak about the deployment or deployment ramp that you anticipate? You've been hiring quite a bit in the area of technical support and consulting for the last number of years. Do you have the requisite capacity for the kind of ramp that's large deal and visions? And given its scope, would it be fair to assume that there had to have been some SPDM components to the transaction? And then, for Maria, looking past the current perturbations on cash flow from COVID, longer term, is there anything that you could foresee doing that is structurally or in terms of mix, to further improve the visibility of operating cash flow? Or is it just going to be indefinitely subject to the quarterly vagaries of 606?\nAjei Gopal: So, let me take the first question and then Maria will take the second question. So with respect to your comment about the capacity, as I said before, this was a customer who's a long-time customer of ours and we have a long-standing relationship with this customer, both at the executive level as well as the technical level. And so, we're very comfortable, both in our ability to be able to provide the products and to support our customer through this next generation of their usage of our technology. So this is -- we don't anticipate any challenges or any concerns in our ability to support our customers. As I said, the areas that they're standardizing on obviously, it's a multiphysics deal. I've mentioned, the additive use of that in manufacturing. I mentioned electrification. I mentioned digital twins. I did not mention SPDM, but, yes, SPDM was also part of that particular relationship. So, as I said, long standing customer, we're very confident about our ability to support that customer. Maria?\nMaria Shields: Yes. So, Jay, relative to your question around cash flow longer-term, what I'd say is if you think about longer-term, ACV margin less taxes is probably the metric that will be more correlated than the 606 P&L, because of the volatility that you mentioned. But larger deals come with more favourable payments. So sometimes in connection with those larger deals, we will grant extensions as part of the negotiation. So I can't say all of the volatility will be removed. But certainly if you take that ACV margin less taxes, I think that is -- it will give you a more stable prediction around operating cash flow going forward.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.\nJason Celino: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It\u2019s nice to hear from everybody. If we think about -- and this is more of a broad kind of question. If we think about the linearity of improvement through the quarter anything to call out specific to maybe like the last month?\nMaria Shields: Yes. So what I'll say, if you take a look at Q2 and obviously, we did Q2's linearity, it was extremely similar to Q2 of 2019. So the third month still disproportionately is where the largest deals and the largest volume of business tend to close. And so we didn't see any changes relative to linearity nor do we expect any significant changes in linearity as we look out for the remainder of the year.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Hedberg: Hi, guys. Great. Thanks for taking the question. I know ANSYS Cloud is still pretty small relative to your overall business, but it was really good to hear how Coke adopted it to support remote work. As you guys talk to customers, do you get a sense that ANSYS Cloud adoption could perhaps accelerate even faster than previously expected in a post-COVID world?\nAjei Gopal: So Matt, as we said this was an example where -- and what Coke referred to was the fact that their engineers were more productive than they might have been in their data centres and that's reflective of the fact that the Cloud provides them with access to the latest hardware. They're not necessarily -- in general, it provides engineers with access to the latest hardware. They're not tied to whatever investments may have been made in the data centres of -- at the time that the data centres were set up or at the time that they were updated. So there's some real advantages to being able to take advantage -- to use the Cloud. And certainly as people and engineers are trying to get access to cloud technology from -- or access to simulation activity from wherever they may be working from home from remote locations, certainly we see the cloud as being important. You have to recognize of course that, our customers have made in many cases significant investments in data centres and they continue to take advantage of those data centres. And many of our customers have built in place a working model where you have engineers in remote locations accessing their data centres remotely to be able to take advantage of our technologies. So it's a mix. I mean, they're taking advantage of cloud technology. Sometimes they're using on-premises, sometimes they'll use a hybrid. We certainly do expect to see an acceleration in the use of cloud technology, and certainly the acceleration of use of ANSYS Cloud as a result of this pandemic. There is no question that that will be the case. However, it is off a small base, as we've said to you before, and our -- and we have a very long tail in terms of the investment that our customers have made in HPC. So you should factor all of that when you consider the dynamic in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Wong with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Sorry, if this has already been asked. My line kept dropping earlier. But just wanted to check in on North America, I was a little surprised to see it growing 33% and outpacing the other region. Can you talk about kind of the shape of the recovery in your various regions, and kind of where you think we are in terms of how the U.S. is tracking versus some of your other regions?\nAjei Gopal: Well, Ken if I talk about larger deals as an example, you'll see that the U.S. has a number of large customers. And certainly, if you start to look to the second half of the year, we do have some renewals from these larger customers and that obviously also causes us to look to the U.S. in terms of driving activity. And part -- as we look to the second half of the year, we also do have some larger transactions that we're expecting from Europe as well. So we're expecting some larger activity in the second half of the year from the EMEA team as well. So North America, generally speaking much larger number of large deals spread more over the Europe. There are some large deals more towards the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I just got two quick ones. Just on Discovery Live, you've talked in the past about that being a medium-term opportunity. But the new upgrades in Discovery seemed really interesting. So I was just curious if this can help accelerate the time line for adoption around Discovery? And then two, just to clarify the ACV and revenue guide rates for the full year was that just due to FX tailwinds? Or was there something else? Thanks so much.\nAjei Gopal: So, let me address the question about Discovery. As I said in the script earlier, and if you -- if you listened to our launch last week you probably would have seen that, we -- when we launched Discovery the current version of Discovery, it is an improvement over the previous version in that we have seamless connections into our flagship solvers. So not only have we made a number of improvements to the Discovery Live engine as well we've built these seamless connections and the UI has been -- and the interface has been completely revamped as well. So it's a very interesting -- we think it's a very exciting product and it brings together the notion of interactive modelling, it brings together real time simulation and it brings together the accuracy of the ANSYS flagship solvers into one end-user experience that, we think is radically easy to use. So we're very excited about this technology. The reason obviously, we've made these enhancements is because we're getting feedback from customers and we're evolving the technology. So we see this as being -- as certainly helping our ability to continue to sell and be successful in the marketplace. I also mentioned, as we're talking about Discovery, I also mentioned our partner PTC and the success that they're seeing with their OEM of Discovery into Creo Simulation Live. So we're seeing continued trials and adoption of Discovery. We're excited about the product line. It is as I said, and as I've been very careful to caution all of you it is off a very small base. It's a new product in a conservative market. But we're very excited about the product and the capabilities and similarly excited about our relationship with PTC.\nMaria Shields: Yes. And Adam with respect to the second part of your question on the ACV and revenue increase, yes, it's basically currency-related. At this stage, we didn't feel that the movement of one large deal from Q3 to Q2 would warrant us increasing the full year outlook just given the pipe and what we see right now we feel comfortable with the guide that we gave last evening.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Listen, most of my questions have been answered. Maybe just one for you Maria. Just a quick follow-up on the last one with respect to ACV guide. I think, we said it's about 4% to 8% on constant currency growth with the revised guide. Can you just remind us how much of that is inorganic?\nMaria Shields: Yes. So Q3 about 5% to 6% and for the full year 5%, Saket. \nSaket Kalia: Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you. With our strong execution, coupled with a diverse customer base Q2 has once again demonstrated the strength and the resilience of the ANSYS business. I would like to really thank the global ANSYS team, including our employees, our channel partners and our other strategic partners, for their continued dedication and their passion in helping our customers develop the best products in the market that are making simulation pervasive. And thank you everyone for joining the call. Be safe and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Maria Shields",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Hello everyone. Ajei shared a few highlights from our Q2 results. And now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our strong second quarter financial performance and provide both qualitative and quantitative color around our outlook and key assumptions for Q3 and the remainder of 2020. I also encourage you to please review all of the Q2 earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to again say thank you to the ANSYS team. In our efforts to remain focused on employee safety, most of our colleagues continue to work from home throughout the second quarter and we believe that this will likely continue to be the case throughout most of what remains of 2020. We have leveraged our previous investments in collaboration and infrastructure to remain connected and we continue to seamlessly support our customers and each other. Our HR team has also promoted initiatives around health and wellness so that we can support our employees' well-being through these historic times. Now let me move on to our financial performance. Our Q2 results reflect the resiliency from the ANSYS business model combined with our continued focus on executing against our plans. We finished the quarter with total revenue of $389.7 million or constant currency revenue growth of 6% and operating margin and EPS results that were both well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. Our revenue in Q2 was driven by strong sales execution. As Ajei mentioned earlier the closing of the largest new business professional license deal in the company's history was the primary contributor to our revenue being above the high end of our guidance range. I would also just like to highlight that these results are quite impressive when considering the very strong comparable of last year's second quarter in which we reported constant currency revenue growth of 23%. The combination of our strong second quarter and first half results and the strength of our sales pipeline give us confidence that we are on the right path as we continue to make meaningful progress towards achieving our longer-term strategic objectives and delivering on our 2020 financial commitment. Key financial metrics for the quarter continue with Q2, ACV of $344 million or constant currency growth of 6% with 83% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Strong lease sales which drove a 14% increase in lease license revenue combined with a continued high renewal rate on maintenance contracts contributed to building our deferred revenue and backlog to a Q2 total of $846.5 million, an 18% increase over last year's comparable balance and a new record Q2 high. This provides us good visibility into the second half of 2020. The strong top line results combined with our continued focus on fiscal discipline helped to drive a second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 43% which finished well above the high end of our Q2 guidance. In line with the plans that we had communicated last quarter, we continued to manage our business at reduced levels of discretionary spending. The most notable being in the category of business travel and entertainment as safety concerns continued to limit our ability to travel throughout the second quarter. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. While we have been managing the business throughout most of the first half of 2020 at a reduced pace of hiring, we did increase our employee base by approximately 170 employees in Q2 which included the addition of 58 employees through the acquisition of Lumerical that we closed on April 1. The net result was second quarter EPS of $1.55 which also finished above the high end of our guidance and which benefited from the overperformance in revenue. With respect to taxes our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.5%, which is also the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2020. We further strengthened our cash and balance sheet position in the second quarter with cash flow from operations that totaled $132 million for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $279 million for the first half. We closed Q2 with a total of $745 million in cash and short-term investments. And through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time remaining cognizant of the uncertainties that exist in the current operating environment. As we had previously communicated, against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global marketplace, we elected to cease our share repurchase activity during the quarter, which lays up with 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. We will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions in determining when might be the most opportune time to consider reinstating future share repurchases. While no shares were repurchased during the quarter, substantially all of our cash flow from operations in the first half was deployed on the combination of share repurchases, capital expenditures and the acquisition of Lumerical. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Before I get into the specific numbers, let me just provide a few qualitative comments with respect to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about our business for the second half. During our last call, Ajei discussed how our team had created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe was the most appropriate framework based upon everything that we knew at the time. As we progressed through the second and into the current quarter, we have continued to execute against that framework and to evolve our plans factoring in both new data as it becomes available and the continuing uncertainty that exists in the global market. Consistent with our practice from last quarter, we will continue to provide outlook for Q3 and the remainder of 2020, but with ranges that are wider than those historically provided to account for the increased uncertainty. To summarize, coming off our very strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for the third quarter and increasing our revenue earnings ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. The increases to revenue and ACV are to reflect a weaker dollar currency environment. Now let me move on to the details of our outlook. For Q3, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $347 million to $377 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.34. For the full year, we are increasing our outlook to factor in both our strong second quarter financial results as well as changes in key currency rates that may have taken place since we last provided our outlook in early May. Starting with non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.645 billion, or constant currency growth in the range of 2% to 7% and EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.35. We are also increasing our full year 2020 ACV outlook to a range of $1.52 billion to $1.585 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth of 4% to 8%. With respect to the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the business environment that is similar to or marginally better than Q2 as many customers have not resumed full operations and employees continue to work from how. We also continue to expect that the effects of the pandemic will continue to adversely impact our levels of new business, particularly in the SMB space and disproportionately affecting perpetual licenses. Our current outlook continues to anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter buoyed by the pipeline for multi-year leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. Our outlook for the remainder of 2020 factors in everything that we are currently aware of, with respect to ongoing trade discussions and customer sentiment across our geographically and industry-diverse customer base. It also reflects spending in the second half related to several business infrastructure and digital transformation projects as well as increased sales and third party commissions. With respect to annual operating cash flow, we are increasing our outlook for 2020 to a range of $435 million to $475 million. This is reflective of our current view on full year ACV, revenue, profitability estimates and tax payments. As we have previously communicated, we have also factored into our outlook, the adverse impact of customer payments that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term negotiations on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. Currently we are increasing our estimates of the impact of 2020 operating cash flow to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. Looking ahead to Q3, we are expecting operating margins in the range of 34.5% to 38.5% and for the full year in line with our previous communications, we're expecting to finish the year with strong operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These targets are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for the second half of 2020. These plans continue to include a slower pace of hiring, reduced discretionary spending and decreased spending on noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. In line with our previous commentary, it is our intention to continue to fund our internal digital transformation projects as these are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long-term. Further details around specific currency rates and other key quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We are striving to be as transparent as we can and have tried to factor in the added uncertainty around the timing of closing larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that conditions will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how long the pandemic continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiments and purchasing decisions as it has since this global crisis first began to unfold late in the first quarter. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, aiming to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to strengthening our leadership position and to capturing the long-term market opportunity that we see ahead of us. In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with strong first half financial and operational results. We were able to deliver well ahead in our Q2 financial commitment, including the closing of the two milestone deals that Ajei spoke to earlier. These strong results are a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of our employees, customers and partners. The combination of our long-standing customer relationships, best-in-class products, diverse customer base, high level of recurring ACV, stable renewal rates and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow, all contributed to the stability of our business in these challenging times. We saw that strength and stability reflected in our results for the second quarter and first half and these foundational pillars are what give us confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and our longer term vision of making simulation pervasive. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Yes. So Joe let me start off by saying, if you look at the guide for the remainder of the year and second half and in line with some of the comments that Ajei and I made around how Q2 had played out, if you look at the overperformance in Q2 right, influenced by two milestone deals and in particular the one paid-up deal that contributed about $10 million to paid up that was originally scheduled for Q3 that came into Q2. So our outlook on the full year hasn't really changed. But given the dynamics and the fact that the pace of acceleration in Q3 is not happening at the rate that we had projected when we spoke to you back in early May, we just thought it was more prudent based on everything that we're seeing and the fact that customers are having extended work from home and the coronavirus situation continues to have a lot of volatility around it, it was just more prudent to go ahead and increase the ACV to take into account what's happened relative to currency, but not change our outlook on the full year. We've got a good strong pipe. We got good visibility into it. The fact that we can close those milestone deals in Q2 during the height of the pandemic continues to give us confidence that even though we've got this extended work-from-home situation that our team is effective in engaging with customers and being able to close these deals. So at this point, I don't think we're ready to start talking about upside. I think we're just ready to talk about the confidence that we have in the outlook that we've put out there today. So Andrew, relative to the 170, let me just highlight that was the higher end during all of Q2 not just in June. And that did include 58 of the employees that we brought on board in April through the Lumerical acquisition. We are on pace against our reduced hiring plan that we spoke about in May. And we're continuing to operate the business against that reduced plan just in light of the fact that the COVID situation is going on much longer than we had anticipated when we had these conversations back in May. But we are continuing to hire and we are continuing to invest because we believe that when this turns, we are going to be in an even stronger situation given the importance of simulation and the role that it plays in mission-critical R&D within our customers. So we don't want to stop investing albeit, we are investing at a slower pace and very much in line with the scenarios that we had created back in May when we have realigned all of our business plans for the remainder of the year. Yes. So, with respect to SMB, it's about a-third of our business, Tyler. And a lot of that business is covered by our channel partners. And if you look at the reduction in our plans since COVID began, about 75% of the reduction comes from the SMB space. And you're also seeing that in the decline in the perpetual business, which is largely attributable to that space as well. We are not factoring in into our outlook, for the remainder of the year, any significant recovery in that space. We think it's going to take longer, just given that they are not as well capitalized and don't have the same liquidity that our enterprise customers do. And so, what we're doing, we are trying to help our customers and our channel partners through these very challenging times, because as we discovered in 2008 and 2009, when you go through difficult times, you're able to create very strong relationships that then you can build off for the next decade. And so we want to continue that practice, because it's important that we maintain those relationships. And so, we're doing everything that we can relative to helping from a cash flow perspective, extending payment terms. And as you saw we went ahead and increased our outlook relative to the amount of 2020 cash flow that will be impacted where we will see payments shift into 2021 as we help our customers and our channel partners through these challenging times. Yes. So, Jay, relative to your question around cash flow longer-term, what I'd say is if you think about longer-term, ACV margin less taxes is probably the metric that will be more correlated than the 606 P&L, because of the volatility that you mentioned. But larger deals come with more favourable payments. So sometimes in connection with those larger deals, we will grant extensions as part of the negotiation. So I can't say all of the volatility will be removed. But certainly if you take that ACV margin less taxes, I think that is -- it will give you a more stable prediction around operating cash flow going forward. Yes. So what I'll say, if you take a look at Q2 and obviously, we did Q2's linearity, it was extremely similar to Q2 of 2019. So the third month still disproportionately is where the largest deals and the largest volume of business tend to close. And so we didn't see any changes relative to linearity nor do we expect any significant changes in linearity as we look out for the remainder of the year. Yes. And Adam with respect to the second part of your question on the ACV and revenue increase, yes, it's basically currency-related. At this stage, we didn't feel that the movement of one large deal from Q3 to Q2 would warrant us increasing the full year outlook just given the pipe and what we see right now we feel comfortable with the guide that we gave last evening. Yes. So Q3 about 5% to 6% and for the full year 5%, Saket."

            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Thanks to strong execution, ANSYS delivered Q2 revenue operating margin and earnings that exceeded the high end of our guidance. Our Q2 results illustrate the close relationships we have built with our customers, which were important as the overwhelming majority of our business in Q2 was transacted remotely. That included two notable sales. First, we closed the largest total contract in our 50-year history at almost $100 million with an existing customer in the automotive and ground transportation space. This customer is standardizing on ANSYS solutions for multi-physics, additive manufacturing, electrification, and digital twin to develop great products faster and more affordably. Our second notable deal was our largest new business professional agreement which was driven by our flagship HFSS for electromagnetics and LS-DYNA for explicit analysis. This $12 million agreement with a major high-tech company had been forecasted for the second half of the year. But based on the customer's evolving needs and strong sales execution we were able to sign the contract in Q2. That contract was the primary contributor to our Q2 revenue coming in over the high end of our guidance. Turning to our performance by industries, Q2 played -- largely played out as we had expected. We saw little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical which included the $12 million new business deal that I have already mentioned. Similarly, the defense segment remains relatively stable due to its focus on technology to support national security. For example, in Q2, we closed a seven-figure multiyear deal with a European defense contractor. Even while many manufacturing plants were idle due to COVID, the automotive industry is continuing its investment in R&D. In particular, OEMs and their supply chains continue to rely on simulations for emerging solutions and electrification and autonomy. Our optical solutions were adopted by a North American autonomous electric vehicle developer and by an Asian automotive OEM to advance their ADAS programs. Also in Asia Tier 1 automotive supplier DENSO signed a three-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy. Our Q2 performance by geography was as we expected with North America leading the way. North America has our largest installed base of enterprise customers with a number of them due to renew their leases in 2020. We are seeing a high renewal rate for those leases and are expanding on them by attaching new product sales. However, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks document we saw a slowdown in the SMB space across all our major geographies as we had predicted in our last earnings call. Despite the uncertain economic times, companies are continuing their investments in R&D. As we have previously discussed R&D is typically the initiative least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. Customers view simulations and the key component of R&D a force multiplier that helps them drive both top-line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Furthermore, the pandemic has limited access to labs for some customers making simulations even more important than ever. Some other customers have struggled with remote access to corporate data centers and are taking advantage of ANSYS Cloud to give their engineers access to high-performance compute capacity. For example our customer Coca-Cola is reporting that ANSYS Cloud is dramatically reducing the time required for simulations making its engineers working from home even more productive than when they were in the office. Our inaugural Simulation World virtual conference clearly illustrated the importance of simulations to customers and prospects across industries. More than 55,000 registrants from around the world signed up to learn how companies such as Ferrari, HPE, Honeywell, Siemens, Ford, Seagate and Bosch are using ANSYS simulation to develop their next-generation products. They also heard from our partners including Microsoft, PTC, Autodesk and Rockwell Automation. Simulation World demonstrated the power of digital transformation and the key role that simulation plays in making our customers' digital transformation is successful. Our customers continued reliance on simulation. Along with our proven ability to close even the largest deals remotely gives us confidence as we forecast the second half of the year. We have increased our guidance to reflect currency changes, improved cash flow and our EPS overachievement in Q2. Maria will give you the details in a few minutes. Moving to our product successes. We recently released ANSYS 2020 R2. This innovative release helps distributed engineering teams accelerate innovation by harnessing new streamlined workflows and dynamic capabilities across our multiphysics product suites. Some of the many highlights of R2 include: a streamlined fluids workflow to simulate capacity fade and cell life in Fluent; integration of solver capabilities from LS-DYNA into our mechanical interface; the ability to solve over 100 million unknowns in a single simulation, while delivering a nearly 10x increased solution size in our electromagnetics flagship product HFSS; a new electrothermal option in our semiconductor solution RedHawk-SC, which uses our big data platform to solve coupling of various structures on over one billion instances concurrently; and platform upgrades that empower engineers to rapidly process and finalize their designs through cloud-based high-performance computing. As part of our ANSYS 2020 R2 launch, we also unveiled our next-generation upfront simulation solution ANSYS Discovery. With built-in seamless connection to ANSYS flagship products, Discovery now empowers all engineers to explore large -- larger design spaces and quickly answer critical design questions early, resulting in improved ensuring productivity and product quality. Our partner PTC has embedded Discovery into CAD solution Creo Simulation Live. On its recent earnings call, PTC announced the closing of its first 7-figure Creo Simulation Live deal with a large U.S. government agency as well as the closing of 10 follow-on expansion deals. As the product continues to build momentum PTC is planning new marketing programs to support sales. We have partnered with Microsoft, Dell, GE and Lendlease to form the Digital Twin Consortium. Physics-based digital twin technology enables companies to head off problems before they occur, prevent unplanned downtime, improve the customer experience and drive innovation and performance. This consortium will build an ecosystem of digital twin users, drive best practices and define requirements for new digital twin standards across industries. Due to our deep commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels Fast Company has once again named ANSYS as one of the best workplaces for innovators. Working with Accenture, Fast Company recognized ANSYS for giving employees the freedom to explore the ideas that benefit our customers and the communities we serve. Turning to our recent moves and M&A. We started Q2 with our acquisition of Lumerical which enables ANSYS customers to predict the behaviour of light within complex photonic devices structures and systems. By integrating Lumerical's photonics products with our semiconductor and optical suites, designers can accurately predict the impact of both nanoscale and macroscale optics for automotive displays, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and even the development of cosmetics. Our acquisition of LSTC continues to play a key role in expanding our solution footprint with customers around the world. In Europe our channel partner DYNAmore inked an important deal with BMW to adopt ANSYS LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing replacing an incumbent competitor. And in Asia a major global automotive OEM continued its investment in LS-DYNA as the product of choice for crash safety analysis. This is exciting news coming just months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. Finally I'm proud that ANSYS has been named one of the Bay Area's Best Places to Work by the San Francisco Business Times and the Silicon Valley Business Journal. This recognition is a testament to our diverse and inclusive culture which incorporates valuable perspectives and background to solve complex challenges for our customers. To summarize, Q2 was a strong quarter highlighted by great execution across the board thanks to our global team of dedicated employees and channel partners. Despite the economic uncertainties our customers know that ANSYS' simulation technologies help them solve their most vexing product challenges, whether they're working in a corporate research lab or using the cloud from their home offices. They know that ANSYS simulation delivers both top line revenue growth and significant cost savings. And they know that ANSYS simulation will position them for future growth and market success. Our ability to close business and to support our customers even if they work remotely gives us confidence to deliver against our objectives for the second half of the year. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q2 as well as the details around our outlook and the assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria? And just to add a little bit more colour on the recruiting, we are hiring people of course across the company. You saw as Maria said with Lumerical, we got a number of R&D, very skilled executive -- employees who joined the company. And we've also been recruiting in our ACE organization and our shared services team. So, we're really recruiting across all of the different functions in the areas -- the strategic areas that we have talked about in the past. And so we're continuing to execute against the longer-term plans that we've put in place and that we've discussed with you earlier. Well, I think its -- Jackson, it goes to the point that I've been making all along. As you consider our relationship with our customers, we have built over the decades very deep relationships with our customers and they rely on us for the areas that are most important to them specifically in the areas of R&D and the creation of new products. And even as we're seeing in certain parts of the economy and certainly automotive is a great example where there is some short -- where there is a demand challenge that you're seeing in -- and you're seeing slowdowns and you're seeing shutdowns in plants. What's really important to recognize and certainly automotive companies recognize as well is that, as we come out of the pandemic investment in R&D is what allows them to maintain their edge as they come out of this. And so, that's it. It's a commitment to R&D. It's a commitment to the long-term success of their business. And it's a recognition that simulation what we provide is absolutely essential. It's a force multiplier, as I said in my comments. It's a force multiplier to their R&D initiatives. So this is one thing. The other thing is, I think that, when you consider people working from home or rethinking the digital nature of their product processes and exactly what it means now to be able to take all of your employees and have them be effective from home, it becomes even more important to consider that digital transformation. And in our opinion, there isn't a pure representation of the digital behaviour of the product and simulation. That is the essence of the digital behaviour of a product. And again, our customers recognize this. And as you start to see this transition and the understanding that digital transformation or the understanding of how to take advantage of digital technologies is going to be essential for product development in the future, I think that plays into our sweet spot. So it's customer relationships, it's the importance of simulation. It's the nature of the businesses that our customers that are running. All of those are important. So, let me take the first question and then Maria will take the second question. So with respect to your comment about the capacity, as I said before, this was a customer who's a long-time customer of ours and we have a long-standing relationship with this customer, both at the executive level as well as the technical level. And so, we're very comfortable, both in our ability to be able to provide the products and to support our customer through this next generation of their usage of our technology. So this is -- we don't anticipate any challenges or any concerns in our ability to support our customers. As I said, the areas that they're standardizing on obviously, it's a multiphysics deal. I've mentioned, the additive use of that in manufacturing. I mentioned electrification. I mentioned digital twins. I did not mention SPDM, but, yes, SPDM was also part of that particular relationship. So, as I said, long standing customer, we're very confident about our ability to support that customer. Maria? So Matt, as we said this was an example where -- and what Coke referred to was the fact that their engineers were more productive than they might have been in their data centres and that's reflective of the fact that the Cloud provides them with access to the latest hardware. They're not necessarily -- in general, it provides engineers with access to the latest hardware. They're not tied to whatever investments may have been made in the data centres of -- at the time that the data centres were set up or at the time that they were updated. So there's some real advantages to being able to take advantage -- to use the Cloud. And certainly as people and engineers are trying to get access to cloud technology from -- or access to simulation activity from wherever they may be working from home from remote locations, certainly we see the cloud as being important. You have to recognize of course that, our customers have made in many cases significant investments in data centres and they continue to take advantage of those data centres. And many of our customers have built in place a working model where you have engineers in remote locations accessing their data centres remotely to be able to take advantage of our technologies. So it's a mix. I mean, they're taking advantage of cloud technology. Sometimes they're using on-premises, sometimes they'll use a hybrid. We certainly do expect to see an acceleration in the use of cloud technology, and certainly the acceleration of use of ANSYS Cloud as a result of this pandemic. There is no question that that will be the case. However, it is off a small base, as we've said to you before, and our -- and we have a very long tail in terms of the investment that our customers have made in HPC. So you should factor all of that when you consider the dynamic in the marketplace. Well, Ken if I talk about larger deals as an example, you'll see that the U.S. has a number of large customers. And certainly, if you start to look to the second half of the year, we do have some renewals from these larger customers and that obviously also causes us to look to the U.S. in terms of driving activity. And part -- as we look to the second half of the year, we also do have some larger transactions that we're expecting from Europe as well. So we're expecting some larger activity in the second half of the year from the EMEA team as well. So North America, generally speaking much larger number of large deals spread more over the Europe. There are some large deals more towards the second half of the year. So, let me address the question about Discovery. As I said in the script earlier, and if you -- if you listened to our launch last week you probably would have seen that, we -- when we launched Discovery the current version of Discovery, it is an improvement over the previous version in that we have seamless connections into our flagship solvers. So not only have we made a number of improvements to the Discovery Live engine as well we've built these seamless connections and the UI has been -- and the interface has been completely revamped as well. So it's a very interesting -- we think it's a very exciting product and it brings together the notion of interactive modelling, it brings together real time simulation and it brings together the accuracy of the ANSYS flagship solvers into one end-user experience that, we think is radically easy to use. So we're very excited about this technology. The reason obviously, we've made these enhancements is because we're getting feedback from customers and we're evolving the technology. So we see this as being -- as certainly helping our ability to continue to sell and be successful in the marketplace. I also mentioned, as we're talking about Discovery, I also mentioned our partner PTC and the success that they're seeing with their OEM of Discovery into Creo Simulation Live. So we're seeing continued trials and adoption of Discovery. We're excited about the product line. It is as I said, and as I've been very careful to caution all of you it is off a very small base. It's a new product in a conservative market. But we're very excited about the product and the capabilities and similarly excited about our relationship with PTC. Thank you. With our strong execution, coupled with a diverse customer base Q2 has once again demonstrated the strength and the resilience of the ANSYS business. I would like to really thank the global ANSYS team, including our employees, our channel partners and our other strategic partners, for their continued dedication and their passion in helping our customers develop the best products in the market that are making simulation pervasive. And thank you everyone for joining the call. Be safe and enjoy the rest of your day."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Detwiler for some opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nLee Detwiler: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our first quarter Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our first quarter financial results and business update as well as our Q2 and updated fiscal year 2020 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. I would like to remind everyone that in addition to any risks and uncertainties that we highlight during the course of this call, important factors that may affect our future results are discussed at length in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are also available via our website. We note in particular that uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Additionally, the company's reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance as there are risks and uncertainties that could impact our business in the future. These statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information unless we do so in a public forum. During this call and in the prepared remarks, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and a full reconciliation of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures is included in this morning's earnings release materials and related Form 8-K. I would now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers. Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria. Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model. In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated. As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance. In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multi-physics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins. In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS. For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of protype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors. In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled. These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications. Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption. We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family. I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain it to the zodiacs. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling; both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth. In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, MacKenzie. This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies. Let me give you two examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country. Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world. I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter. Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers. Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk. Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact. With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor. Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations. In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical, the low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business. Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has a largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding. Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials. We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies; especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress. With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail. Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who event as customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio. Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers; both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria?\nMaria Shields: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020. In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you. Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter. Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter. Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases. Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided. Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year. For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results. Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success. In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners. As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Ajei, for you, let me ask a longer term question about where you and the engineering software industry are going as though COVID did not exist? Meaning where you and your peers seem to be going or ought to go over the next half decade or more. So the question is, there seems to be an incipient arms race going on among engineering software companies in terms of their underlying architectures and data platforms as their future architectures. You have Minerva, PTC recently alluded to Atlas, AUTOBEST Forge. And so, of course, is 3Dx. So the question is, how are you thinking about the long-term impact or importance to you in terms of maintaining or gaining share from this new architecture that you have? And are there any implications in terms of your moving from a highly discrete deliverable schedule, as you just alluded to in your remarks, to more of a continuous flow of deliverables over time? And then secondly, the question has to do with COVID. And at the risk of extrapolation, are there any attributes of the business that you think might go on indefinitely or that you would have to think about doing more on an ongoing basis? For example, investing more in inside sales, potentially even an e-store or some kind or in some way, all three or doing things differently with your many partners like Microsoft, Rockwell, et cetera?\nAjei Gopal: So Jay, that's a long question. Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events. With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged. With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need. Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future.\nMaria Shields: And Jay, just one thing that I'll add to that is, as you spoke about, as we think about our own business and how our models will transition or our ways of interacting with customers, that is the primary reason that for the past several years, we have been aggressively investing in our own digital transformation so that we can enable automation and build a platform that will allow us to efficiently scale our business from $2 billion to $5 billion and beyond. So that is the primary driver of why we've been pushing so much of our own digital transformation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim.\nKen Wong: Great. So I just wanted to, I guess, touch on a couple of comments you guys made. So in the prepared remarks, you guys highlighted not seeing any material impact on your business from COVID-19. And then also, Maria, when you talked about guidance that it was based entirely on just how it relates to expected effects of the pandemic. So it seems to suggest that you guys currently aren't exactly seeing any erosion to your business. I guess I want to maybe dig into that a little bit, make sure I'm understanding that correctly in terms of how you're forecasting. And then to the extent that there is any concern -- well, in terms of the lower guidance, I just wanted to understand kind of what's coming from maybe just push out those deals and maybe what is coming from contraction of potential contracts that you guys are looking to renew or sign?\nMaria Shields: So Ken, just to clarify, I think you needed to take a look at prepared remarks again. What we said is we didn't see a material impact only in Q1. So if you look at our Q1 results, they came -- all of the key metrics came in at basically the midpoint or a little bit better than what we had forecasted when we gave guidance at the end of February. Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea. But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past 6 weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full year outlook, which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19, the most dramatic being Q2.\nKen Wong: Okay, got it. And then, in terms of kind of where that impact is coming from, any sense of if that -- again, is this more of a customer pushing out stuff? Or is the reduction in ACV more due to customers, I guess, kind of bringing in deal sizes, not attaching as many new products? Just trying to understand kind of where the softness is coming from in terms of the outlook.\nMaria Shields: So I'd say it's a combination of -- yes, deals being pushed out as our customers are dealing with their own responses, but I'd say probably the majority of where we're seeing it, particularly in Q2 is at the SMB level; and so in two aspects.\nAjei Gopal: Small and medium business.\nMaria Shields: Small and medium business. Two aspects. One, some of those customers that traditionally were paid up customers are shifting towards taking a look at annual leases just because their access to capital is a little bit more constrained in this environment. And then just in certain cases, they're just delaying. So as we've modeled, as we've worked with our field teams, we believe the largest impact we're going to feel across the business is Q2. And if you recall, when we built our outlook for 2020, even before COVID, we were assuming a very back-end loaded year just because the timing of when those multiyear leases were scheduled to renew, largely in Q4 around customers' year-end purchasing cycles.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Good to hear from everyone. Maria, can you maybe go into more details about this because you mentioned multiple scenarios in your guidance. Can you just frame the low end and the high-end?\nMaria Shields: So yes, if you look at for the full year, basically, we've reduced to revenue. Now we're at the low end 2% and at the high end 7% in constant currency, we ran a variety of scenarios. And if we also used what happened to our business in 2009 as another illustration of a global economic shock. And based on everything, all the scenarios that we came to, we believe that the current guidance that we provided is a good proxy for where we will end the year. And I will caveat that by saying that's based on everything that we know today. Should things transition either way, improve quicker than we've estimated or unfortunately detract, we will continue to -- as the rest of our software peers assess our business every single day and every single week, work our way through it. And then as we exit Q2, we will give you a fresh update on all of the data that we've collected during the second quarter.\nJason Celino: Okay. And if I could ask one quick follow-up; the perpetual license decline of 20% in the quarter. Maybe can you talk about linearity of that, maybe how January and February were compared to the latter end of the quarter?\nMaria Shields: So -- yes. So what I'd say is the -- if you look at the linearity of any quarter, the third month is always the largest volume for leases and paid up. So relative to the decline is paid up, it shouldn't come as any surprise because if you think about a large impact on the business in Q1 was the COVID situation in China, and China today still is largely a paid up market. So when we see pressure on the business in China, you'll also see it reflected in the results in the paid up line.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. And also thanks by the way for the detailed guidance during this uncertain time, certainly not everybody is doing that, so I wanted to acknowledge. Maybe first for you, Maria. And I think you touched on this in a prior question, but just to ask it expressly. Clearly, we've seen more of a shift to lease contracts in this environment versus perpetual for a range of reasons. But I'm wondering what you've seen on contract terms and how are you thinking about that in the guide this year? So specifically, are your lease customers still largely opting for multiyear contracts? Or have some maybe opted to shorten that given the current environment?\nMaria Shields: So Saket, what I'd say is, if you think about our customer base, you should really kind of bifurcate it. At the enterprise level, we are still seeing our large customers thinking long-term because R&D is really a long-term investment. And so an example that Ajei spoke to in his remarks is DENSO, a very long-standing customer that just entered into a 3-year multiyear lease. Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital. But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases. That transition to multiyear leases has really been the journey at the enterprise and strategic level because that customer tends to think longer term than perhaps smaller businesses do.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's very helpful. Ajei, maybe a quick follow-up for you. Understand that you've already given the guide for Q2 and the full year. But a question that's being asked of a lot of companies here is just obviously, the end of March was a very dramatic time, let's say. Some companies have seen a little bit of a bounce back in the month of April. Can you talk qualitatively, of course, to sort of how activity levels have been here in the month of April at all?\nAjei Gopal: I think it's important to recognize that when you think about the actual linearity within the quarter of our business, most of it is back-end loaded. So the earlier part of the quarter, there's a lot of customer activity in terms of meetings and things of that nature. But in terms of actual closed contracts, that starts to come in towards the third month of the quarter. And what we're seeing in April, of course, is as customers were transitioning to a work-from-home model, there was obviously some disruption, I would say, March, as people were thinking through the transition process and trying to make sure that they could get there. But today, we are seeing a number of our customers working from home. Our teams are effectively working from home, we can engage. A lot of the challenges are around being able to do things like demos and so on in our ACE organization, which is our technical customer-facing organization is able to deliver those demos and those capabilities. So we feel very confident in our ability to continue to support our customers as they work from home and the activity levels that we're seeing are consistent with that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg.\nAndrew DeGasperi: I guess on the first, I wanted to look at a long-term picture. When it comes to the physical prototyping and how that's potentially transitioning under the current conditions, have you already seen engagement from some of these customers or any type of discussions with them that might indicate to you that this sort of transition might accelerate?\nAjei Gopal: So, I think there are two -- there are a couple of things that I think are worth sharing. Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful. The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics. Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear.\nAndrew DeGasperi: And if I may, on a follow-up. I mean, can you maybe help us think through your M&A strategy at this stage? I mean, I know you're not changing your long-term plan at all, but has the current crisis sort of changed your thinking around that in terms of deal making?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I think it's really very premature to talk about M&A, exactly what the long-term implication on M&A is going to be. Obviously, we continue to have a pipeline of customers of potential companies that we're continuing to evaluate. And we -- and b, we're evaluating those customers, I mean, if those companies, if you look at what we did with the acquisition of Lumerical, we just closed Lumerical a couple of -- a few weeks ago. During the lockdown period, we were able to onboard all their employees remotely. But we continue to engage with potential acquisition targets. We'll see what happens as the situation plays out.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ajei Gopal for any closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you very much. So I'd like to close by saying that while there is uncertainty in the market, I know that ANSYS has the right team, the best products in the market and strong customer commitments. With our investments in infrastructure and collaboration technologies, the special accommodations for our customers and with our continued fiscal discipline, I believe that ANSYS is well positioned to help our customers during this critical time and well into the future. When this crisis is abated, I believe that we will emerge in an even better leadership position to make simulation pervasive across the product life cycle. I'd like to again acknowledge our more than 4,000 employees around the world who have managed to grow our customer base and support our existing customers during these challenging times. Thank you all so very much. We are ONE Ansys. And finally, I'd like to encourage all of you to join us online at Simulation World, June 10th and 11th. You can find more information and register on the ANSYS website or by going to simulationworld.com. And thank you for joining the call. Be safe and enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Shields",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a perspective on our first quarter financial performance. Then I'll also provide qualitative and quantitative color and context around our outlook assumptions for Q2 and the remainder of 2020. In connection with our updated outlook, I will encourage you to please review all of the earnings documents that we have posted to our Investor Relations website. Before I get started, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to my ANSYS colleagues, who have all successfully navigated the work-from-home transition to enable us to continue to operate our business, support our customers and to be able to meet all of our financial reporting deadlines, including all of the efforts that have gone into supporting today's earnings call. Your teamwork, flexibility, dedication and innovation have been personally inspiring. And for that, I just want to say thank you. Although we faced a more challenging customer demand environment in the latter part of March as compared to our expectations at the time that we provided our February guidance, our financial results reflect solid execution, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all towards the midpoint of the guidance ranges that we previously provided for the quarter. Our start to the year is very encouraging when considering the tough Q1 2019 comparable, in which we reported double-digit revenue growth and the negative impact that COVID-19 inflicted on global economies in the first quarter. Our key financial metrics begin with Q1 ACV of $301 million, with 82% coming from recurring sources and total revenue of $309 million. I will add that the key currency exchange rates were within the ranges that we provided with our first quarter guidance. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $835 million, representing a 24% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline, which yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88% and an operating margin of 29%, in line with our Q1 guidance. Margins were positively impacted by a slower pace of hiring than we had planned as well as reduced travel and corporate event spending. These positive variances were partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The net result was first quarter EPS of $0.83, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19.5%. And going forward, we have adopted a normalized effective tax rate approach for non-GAAP reporting and expect our effective tax rate to remain at 19.5% for the full year. Our cash flow from operations totaled $147 million, and we ended the quarter with a total of $718 million in cash and short-term investments. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased 690,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $233.48. We have 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized program. Against the backdrop of ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the global markets, we will continue to assess both our own financial performance as well as market conditions as they continue to evolve in determining when might be the most opportune time to reinstate any future share repurchases. Through the combination of our current cash position, the additional $500 million that we have available under our undrawn revolver and our projections for 2020 operating cash flow, we believe that we have ample liquidity to continue to progress against our long-term strategy, while at the same time, remaining cognizant of the current environment. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. As this crisis has evolved, our team has created multiple scenarios to build out what we believe is the most appropriate framework for giving investors a forward-looking view of the business based upon everything that we currently know. That being said, because of the very significant market and economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, our ranges for outlook are wider than those that we have historically provided. Let me also add that the entirety of our guidance reduction relates to the expected effects of the global pandemic. Factoring in our Q1 results, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and updating our revenue, EPS, ACV and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This update reflects our current views for the remainder of the year as well as the minor contribution from the Lumerical acquisition that we closed on April 1. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $335 million to $375 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.01 to $1.33. This outlook assumes that we will experience the most significant business disruption in the second quarter. Based upon discussions with our customers and channel partners, we anticipate delays in the timing of closing certain transactions and, in particular, larger enterprise deals may be especially challenging. We have also assumed that some customers will delay certain purchases until later in the year. For the full year, we are updating both the revenue and EPS outlook to non-GAAP revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.630 billion or constant currency growth of 2% to 7%, and EPS in the range of $5.61 to $6.23. We are also updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents constant currency ACV growth in the range of 3% to 9%. With respect to the remainder of the year, we expect a modest recovery in the business environment in Q3 as employees return to work and businesses begin to resume operations. Our current assumptions anticipate a stronger recovery in the fourth quarter, buoyed by a combination of sales transactions that may have been deferred from earlier quarters, and the sales outlook for multiyear leases that are currently forecasted to close in Q4. With respect to annual operating cash flows, we are updating our outlook for 2020 to a range of $425 million to $470 million. This is reflective of our updated full year ACV, revenue and profitability estimates. We have also factored into our outlook an incremental $10 million to $20 million of customer payments that would have otherwise been made in 2020 that may be delayed into 2021 as a result of extended payment term requests on new contracts and delayed payments on existing contracts. For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margins of 33.5% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect operating margins in the range of 40% to 42%. These charges are reflective of our adjusted spending plans for Q2 and the remainder of the year. They include a slower pace of hiring and reduced discretionary spending, as well as decreased spending on certain noncritical facilities and infrastructure projects. On the other hand, we will continue to invest in certain digital transformation projects such as our global CRM and HRIS initiatives, as these projects are critical elements in building the foundation to efficiently operate and scale our business over the long term. Further details around specific currency rates and other quantitative and qualitative assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and 2020 are contained in the prepared remarks document. In our effort to provide greater insight and transparency to investors, we have added additional commentary to our prepared remarks and Form 10-Q, specifically related to the impacts of COVID-19. As a caveat, I will remind everyone that this information is based upon everything that we know as of today. And given the uncertain and unprecedented environment that we are operating under, our assumptions are subject to change. Our current expectations, as reflected in our updated financial outlook, is that there will be a delay in business with an adverse impact on our Q2 and full year results. Beyond the points that Ajei mentioned earlier, regarding the various elements that have contributed to the resiliency of our business model over the long term, from a financial perspective, I'd also like to highlight our high level of recurring ACV, historically stable renewal rates for both leases and maintenance and the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow. We are trying to be as transparent as we can and appreciate that you are all seeking information, details and perspectives on our future outlook. We have tried to take into account the uncertainty, particularly around the timing of larger enterprise deals. We also trust that you will appreciate that there is no certainty in our assumptions and that things will continue to evolve and change in either direction depending on how will this situation continues to negatively impact global economies, customer sentiment and purchasing decisions as it has since this global pandemic first began in Q1. We will continue to remain focused on the things that we can control, trying to strike a balance between short and long-term strategic initiatives that we believe are critical to our long-term success. In closing, we are very fortunate to start the year with solid first quarter financial and operational results. Being able to deliver on our Q1 financial commitments, despite the extreme volatility is a testament to both the resiliency of the ANSYS business model and to the collective efforts and dedication of the broader ANSYS ecosystem that includes our employees, customers and partners. As we look ahead, we remain committed to invest in our business and to continue to execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Our focus and commitment to the long term, combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, long-standing customer relationships and resilient business model give us confidence that we will emerge from this crisis better positioned to capitalize on our long-term growth aspirations. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. And Jay, just one thing that I'll add to that is, as you spoke about, as we think about our own business and how our models will transition or our ways of interacting with customers, that is the primary reason that for the past several years, we have been aggressively investing in our own digital transformation so that we can enable automation and build a platform that will allow us to efficiently scale our business from $2 billion to $5 billion and beyond. So that is the primary driver of why we've been pushing so much of our own digital transformation. So Ken, just to clarify, I think you needed to take a look at prepared remarks again. What we said is we didn't see a material impact only in Q1. So if you look at our Q1 results, they came -- all of the key metrics came in at basically the midpoint or a little bit better than what we had forecasted when we gave guidance at the end of February. Now that being said, when we gave that guidance, we were basically assuming that COVID-19 was somewhat limited to China and perhaps South Korea. But just like everyone in the world, as March progressed, things got progressively worse as this really became a global pandemic. So as a result of that, a lot of stuff has changed in the past 6 weeks. And so that is why we've modified our full year outlook, which now does factor in what we believe is an elongated impact from COVID-19, the most dramatic being Q2. So I'd say it's a combination of -- yes, deals being pushed out as our customers are dealing with their own responses, but I'd say probably the majority of where we're seeing it, particularly in Q2 is at the SMB level; and so in two aspects. Small and medium business. Two aspects. One, some of those customers that traditionally were paid up customers are shifting towards taking a look at annual leases just because their access to capital is a little bit more constrained in this environment. And then just in certain cases, they're just delaying. So as we've modeled, as we've worked with our field teams, we believe the largest impact we're going to feel across the business is Q2. And if you recall, when we built our outlook for 2020, even before COVID, we were assuming a very back-end loaded year just because the timing of when those multiyear leases were scheduled to renew, largely in Q4 around customers' year-end purchasing cycles. So yes, if you look at for the full year, basically, we've reduced to revenue. Now we're at the low end 2% and at the high end 7% in constant currency, we ran a variety of scenarios. And if we also used what happened to our business in 2009 as another illustration of a global economic shock. And based on everything, all the scenarios that we came to, we believe that the current guidance that we provided is a good proxy for where we will end the year. And I will caveat that by saying that's based on everything that we know today. Should things transition either way, improve quicker than we've estimated or unfortunately detract, we will continue to -- as the rest of our software peers assess our business every single day and every single week, work our way through it. And then as we exit Q2, we will give you a fresh update on all of the data that we've collected during the second quarter. So -- yes. So what I'd say is the -- if you look at the linearity of any quarter, the third month is always the largest volume for leases and paid up. So relative to the decline is paid up, it shouldn't come as any surprise because if you think about a large impact on the business in Q1 was the COVID situation in China, and China today still is largely a paid up market. So when we see pressure on the business in China, you'll also see it reflected in the results in the paid up line. So Saket, what I'd say is, if you think about our customer base, you should really kind of bifurcate it. At the enterprise level, we are still seeing our large customers thinking long-term because R&D is really a long-term investment. And so an example that Ajei spoke to in his remarks is DENSO, a very long-standing customer that just entered into a 3-year multiyear lease. Where we're really seeing the biggest dynamic right now and what we built into our outlook for 2020 is that at the small-medium business level, that those customers are probably -- and we're seeing some of this going to choose an annual lease versus a paid up just given the current economic environment and their access to capital. But I will also just comment that today, the majority of our leases are still annual leases. That transition to multiyear leases has really been the journey at the enterprise and strategic level because that customer tends to think longer term than perhaps smaller businesses do."

            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope that you are healthy and safe during these uncertain times. I would like to start by thanking the entire ANSYS team. Their professionalism, commitment during this crisis has been exemplary and it made a tremendous difference for our customers. Let me first talk about how ANSYS responded to COVID-19 and describe our Q1 performance and how we are operating our business in these unusual times. Then I will take a step back and discuss the ANSYS business as a whole, specifically why ANSYS is important to customers and why the business is resilient. Finally, I will provide some color on key elements of the business going forward, including a description of some of the headwinds that we are seeing before I turn the call over to Maria. Of course, ANSYS' first responsibility is to the health and safety of our employees and their families and to the ANSYS community around the world. In mid-February, we closed our offices in China and enabled our employees to work from home. As the crisis spread, we closed other locations around the world. Today, with the improving situation in China and Korea, our offices in those countries are open with our employees maintaining appropriate social distances and health and safety protocols. Our offices elsewhere remain closed or open only to essential staff with the vast majority of employees worldwide continuing to work from home. Our employees have quickly adapted to the challenge, and we are fully engaged in driving our business forward in the work-from-home model. In the last several years, we have invested in our infrastructure and business applications, including our networking and remote access capabilities as well as collaboration technology. These investments have turned out to be invaluable and are helping us run our business today. We are continuing to pay all our salaried and hourly workers, and we are not planning any job action. In fact, we are onboarding new employees remotely and provisioning them to work from home. We have a number of open job requisitions and are seeing a strong flow of candidates who are looking for the stability that a company like ANSYS can provide. We believe that our ongoing investments in our growing team put ANSYS in a strong position to capture additional opportunity once this crisis is abated. As you may recall from when we guided in February, we were expecting the first quarter and the first half of the year to be challenging because of tough year-over-year compare, the effect of China sanctions and a back-end loaded full year. Of course, worldwide economic conditions worsened through March. Nonetheless, I am very proud that the solid execution by the ANSYS team, our revenue, earnings and operating margin for Q1 came in just about at the midpoint of our guidance. In Q1, we saw strength in a number of industries, including automotive, high-tech and energy. In these verticals, our solutions that support the key initiatives of autonomy, electrification and 5G continue to resonate with our customers. For example, in Asia, we inked a new 3-year contract with an existing consumer electronics customer to expand its usage of our flagship multi-physics solutions as well as to expand into digital twins. In North America, we closed several large deals in the high-tech and semiconductor sectors, including at a global hardware provider that agreed to standardize on ANSYS, displacing several competitors. We also closed a 7-figure deal with NuScale Power to bring its small modular nuclear reactor designs to reality through the power of simulation. We were also able to forge new relationships with organizations that have not previously used ANSYS. For example, we signed a 7-figure contract with a new customer, Software Motor Company or SMC. By using ANSYS multiphysics solutions supported by ANSYS Cloud, SMC is developing an automated workflow to rapidly design and analyze motors to be used across industries. The enhanced workflow can compress the weeks of simulation and months of protype testing typically required for these virtually silent motors. In Q1, we delivered Ansys 2020 Release 1 and despite working from home, we will deliver our release to the customers in the summer as originally scheduled. These are major releases and include new capabilities across our multiphysics product portfolio. All products continue to receive recognition and accolades from our customers and partners. For example, industry leader, TSMC recently certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC next-generation system-on-chip power noise sign off-platform for TSMC's FinFET process nodes. This helps customers verify the power requirements and the reliability of chips we use in artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G and high-performance computing applications. Similarly, Samsung Foundry has certified the ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for design using its new 3-dimensional integrated circuit packaging technology. RaptorH marries the best-in-class engines from ANSYS RaptorX, which we gained in last year's Helic acquisition and ANSYS flagship HFSS into a single chip packet system design environment. By validating electromagnetic effects in Samsung's 3D assembly, RaptorH empowers designers to eliminate critical points of failure and accelerate the rate of new technology adoption. We are continuing to look at opportunities to expand our portfolio through M&A. We recently closed our acquisition of Lumerical, which will enable ANSYS customers to predict the behavior of light within complex photonic devices, structures and systems. This is critical as 5G applications and autonomous vehicles are producing massive amounts of data, forcing organizations to handle even more information faster than ever. Lumerical's products enable designers to develop new, high-throughput optical networks by modeling the most challenging problems in photonics, including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. We were able to virtually onboard the Lumerical team, and I'm excited to welcome them into our ONE Ansys family. I'd now like to discuss the ANSYS business and explain it to the zodiacs. The ANSYS value proposition is compelling; both in good times and in tough economic times because simulation helps our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. Using ANSYS simulation, customers can rapidly innovate, easily validate design ideas and improve cycle time. This means that they can launch more of the right products, and do so at a faster pace, which translates to top line growth. In addition, simulation can help customers get more impact from tight R&D budgets by giving engineers the tools to evaluate multiple design options cost effectively and in parallel and by reducing or even eliminating the need for costly physical testing. That is particularly relevant during this global crisis when some customers cannot get access to their labs physically test products. The compelling value and the mission-critical nature of simulation is why customers continue to rely on ANSYS even during periods of uncertainty. It is important to note that the bulk of customers' investments in simulation comes from their research and development or R&D budgets. R&D is the lifeblood of our customers. It's the key differentiator. Our experience is that in tough economic times, R&D is typically the least impacted by budget cuts and the first restored, primarily because it drives future growth and market success. We believe that this is a commonly accepted perspective, and it is corroborated by studies in the Harvard Business Review and by the consulting firm, MacKenzie. This ongoing investment in R&D and in simulation in tough economic times is best illustrated in the automotive industry, where softening demand and worker safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 crisis have forced manufacturers to shut down factories and cut budgets. However, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda and other automakers have publicly reported continued investments in R&D, especially in next-generation technologies, such as autonomy and electrification. If you recall from earlier discussions, these next-generation technologies are exactly where ANSYS has been making strategic investments through both organic development and acquisitions. At ANSYS, we continue to see investments in simulation by automotive OEMs and their suppliers across geographies. Let me give you two examples from Q2. In Asia, DENSO, the Tier 1 automotive supplier, recently signed a 3-year multimillion-dollar deal to adopt ANSYS solutions for automotive parts development for electrification and autonomy as well as for our platform technologies. In Europe, our channel partner, DYNAmore, recently inked an important deal with a major automotive OEM for the adoption of LS-DYNA for virtual crash testing, replacing a competitive product. This is exciting news, indeed, coming just a few months after we closed the acquisition of LSTC. As I also discussed at last year's Investor Day, ANSYS is a resilient model due in part to the number and diversity of customers we serve. We have thousands of customers across multiple industries, including high-tech, semiconductor, aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial and energy. And we are well balanced across the geographies with about 40% of our business coming from the Americas and the rest split roughly evenly between Europe and Asia. That diversity means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. And it also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any individual customer, industry or country. Furthermore, our sales channels are diversified with about 75% coming from our direct force, with the remainder coming from channel partners. We are very flexible in our licensing and consumption models, and customers can purchase a perpetual license, a lease license, or a pay-as-you-go elastic license and can consume our technology on-premises or in the cloud. We believe this diversity and flexibility allows us to reach and support a broad range of customers around the world. I'd now like to give some color on the challenges our users are facing and how we're accommodating them and provide additional comments on the demand environment, including a perspective by industry and by geography. It is important to note that our analysis of demand has already been factored into our Q2 and full year guidance. Let me also caution that with the unprecedented market volatility we are all experiencing, demand could change in either direction as the global situation continues to evolve. We expect the most significant business disruption to occur in the second quarter when our teams and those of our customers work remotely. We are currently assuming a modest recovery in the business environment during the third quarter as states and countries slowly reopen, and business and consumer sentiment begins to improve. We also assume business activity and customer sentiments will continue to improve through the fourth quarter. Comparing this period of disruption with the pre-COVID environment, we expect different kinds of customers will be impacted in different ways. First, it is likely to be more challenging to close deals with brand new customers, primarily because of the difficulty in building new relationships and driving demand with new prospects remotely. Fortunately, for ANSYS, over the course of our 50-year history, we have built a large and loyal customer base. And so while new customers are important, the majority of our business comes from existing customers. Second, we expect larger accounts to perform more strongly than small- and medium-sized businesses. This is to our advantage as the majority of our business comes from these larger accounts. Larger customers have stronger liquidity and capital position, and we believe that a majority of them will be able to maintain their R&D cycles. In contrast, smaller customers tend to be more sensitive to liquidity constraints and are more likely to delay purchases. So, however, that we believe government programs, especially in Europe, will mitigate some of this risk. Furthermore, during this period of disruption, we expect renewal rates to remain strong, although new business will come under incremental pressure. We also expect customers to prefer leases over perpetual because of the smaller initial financial commitment of the lease. And we will see additional scrutiny given to large multiyear contracts, which could result in delays in signing or perhaps smaller commitments than we had previously expected. This could introduce incremental timing uncertainty into our top line. Our prepared remarks contain a more comprehensive discussion of the attributes affecting our pipeline conversion and their related impact. With that backdrop, I'll shift to an industry view. We are seeing little to no reduction in demand in the high-tech and semiconductor vertical, which accounted for about 1/3 of our business in 2019. Many of these customers have deep pockets and are developing products against a multiyear road map, and they are not willing to let a few quarters of uncertainties slowing down. Other companies in large markets such as 5G are in a global race for leadership positions within their industry and are unwilling to delay their R&D efforts and thus see their future to a competitor. Let me now move to aerospace and defense. We anticipate investments will continue for defense and military aerospace, driven by long-term government programs, and we expect to see little to no reduction in demand for ANSYS technology in this vertical. Commercial aerospace and contracts will be impacted in the short term, driven by both pre-COVID challenges faced by some companies and by the dramatic reduction in passenger air travel as a result of this pandemic. However, in the medium to long term, I believe this will be somewhat mitigated by the continued need of long-term R&D initiatives that address environmental issues and government regulations. In the automotive industry, although there has been widespread idling of manufacturing plans, R&D are still receiving funding. And that is particularly true for emerging solutions like autonomy and electrification where ANSYS plays a key role. However, we are expecting to see headwinds on more traditional R&D activities in the sector. Given the need for competitive differentiation, we expect to see ongoing investments in new product introductions for industrial equipment. Although we anticipate a reduction in R&D spending on existing products in this vertical, the low price of oil is causing headwinds in the energy sector. Fortunately, this vertical accounts for a relatively small portion of our business. Let me turn now to a geographical view. Relative to our expected performance of the geographies at the time of our last earnings call, we believe North America will fare the best. North America has a largest installed base of big enterprise customers, and a number of these customers are due to renew their leases of ANSYS products in 2020. We expect a high renewal rate for those leases, and we also expect to attach new product sales to the renewals. Our North America customer base includes a good percentage of high-tech and semiconductor companies, and we expect their R&D and simulation initiatives to continue to receive funding. Asia Pacific entered the COVID-19 crisis a few weeks before the rest of the world. We did see an initial reduction in demand activity there, but we're now seeing a return of demand. For example, we saw China end Q1 stronger than we had expected, and it continues to have momentum in Q2. The high-tech and semiconductor industry remains strong throughout the region. However, we do see some headwinds in the more traditional automotive investments and the heavy industrials. We're expecting some disruptions in business in EMEA, in part because of headwinds related to industrial and traditional automotive activities and in part because we saw some customers struggle with the transition to a work-from-home model. Still, we see relief coming in the form of government programs designed to help companies; especially smaller ones deal with the near-term financial stress. With all these uncertainties, we are reducing our full year revenue and ACV guidance by mid-single digits, with the greatest impact coming in Q2. Maria will go through guidance in more detail. Before I finish, I would like to mention that we are preparing a simulation world, our exciting new online conference that brings together simulation thought leaders and users from around the world. Simulation World will feature a who's who event as customers, including Volkswagen Motorsport, Baker Hughes, Ericsson and Porsche Motorsport. Simulation World already has more than 10,000 registrants, demonstrating the value of simulation in the marketplace. I'm very excited that this forum gives us a new and unique opportunity to generate demand for our multiphysics portfolio. Despite the uncertainties in the market, we believe that our strategy of pervasive simulation and the value that we deliver to our customers is more important than ever. Our strategy accelerates customers' key research and development initiatives, which are not typically impacted by economic slowdowns, and we support critical emerging areas like electrification, autonomy, 5G and the industrial Internet of Things. And our value proposition is compelling to customers; both in good times and in tough economic times because we can help our customers drive both top line revenue growth and achieve significant cost savings. I am confident in our ability to continue to drive long-term growth. And with our continued investment in the business, I believe we are well positioned to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Maria to discuss our financials for Q1 and provide more detail around our outlook and assumptions for the remainder of 2020. Maria? So Jay, that's a long question. Let me try to address that -- address the second part first, and then I'll get to the first part. With respect to what you do in a COVID world, as you may have -- as I mentioned in my comments, we have a very large event Simulation World that we're running online. And that is, I think, one of the largest, if not the largest simulation event online. And we have a number of speakers signed up for that. We have, I think, over 10,000 people who have registered and the month is about -- and the event is about a month away. So there's a lot of interest in the technology and the capabilities. And obviously, we're driving demand from online events to -- excuse me, from in-person events to online events. With respect to our partnership relationships, we continue to drive our relationships with our partners and with our customers and the importance of what we do together remains unchanged. With respect to the first part of your question, the long-term view of our industry, I think it's important to note that the part of the industry where ANSYS lives which is simulation, we believe, is the most important aspect that customers are dealing with. They need simulation in order to be able to validate the design of the products to be able to design the products. Some of the other companies that you mentioned are in other parts of the end-to-end ecosystem. We're in the simulation space. And we believe that this is an extremely valuable part of the end-to-end ecosystem is something that customers do need. Now to your point about platforms, look, I think that there is some in the industry who believe that you need to have a single monolithic platform, which is a single source of truth and ideal single vendor monolithic environment. We don't believe that's the case. Our strategy is completely open. We believe instead in an authoritative source of truth, which is an ecosystem of open, federated and purpose-built domain-specific solutions, and we participate in that. And I think that's a much more realistic way of addressing the digital transformation needs of scale. It's not about picking one platform and locking a vendor or locking a customer into a particular platform, it's vendors like ourselves playing in an open environment, recognizing that we need to be in a position to support our customers as they understand how to create these complex products of the future. Small and medium business. I think it's important to recognize that when you think about the actual linearity within the quarter of our business, most of it is back-end loaded. So the earlier part of the quarter, there's a lot of customer activity in terms of meetings and things of that nature. But in terms of actual closed contracts, that starts to come in towards the third month of the quarter. And what we're seeing in April, of course, is as customers were transitioning to a work-from-home model, there was obviously some disruption, I would say, March, as people were thinking through the transition process and trying to make sure that they could get there. But today, we are seeing a number of our customers working from home. Our teams are effectively working from home, we can engage. A lot of the challenges are around being able to do things like demos and so on in our ACE organization, which is our technical customer-facing organization is able to deliver those demos and those capabilities. So we feel very confident in our ability to continue to support our customers as they work from home and the activity levels that we're seeing are consistent with that. So, I think there are two -- there are a couple of things that I think are worth sharing. Number one is that some customers are not able to access physical labs or were not able to access physical labs. And as a result of that, physical experimentation is suffering. And obviously, simulation does not require you to access a physical lab. You can do all your work on the computer and in a work-from-home scenario. So that has clearly swings away from physical testing towards more simulation activity, and that's obviously a tailwind for us, and that's helpful. The other thing is -- and I think this has been very well established, part of the value proposition, what part of the value proposition of simulation is really being able to address cost, and in particular, you can reduce the number of physical prototypes, and you can test in parallel instead of serializing a sequence of events, you can test a number of things in parallel on the computer. And the fact that you can reduce cost is an important driver. And again, in these tough economic times, people are looking to reduce costs. And that, again, is a good guide to tailwind for simulation. So I'm pretty excited about those dynamics. Another point I'd actually like to make, which is kind of interesting is we've been able to deliver that unique pass situation as the pandemic as we've been able to deliver a number of simulation-based insights to out there. People have been using our technology to come up with ideas or assessments of things like social distancing, the creation of PPE, the creation of medical -- rapid creation of medical devices and a lot of that is being done because of the speed and the rating case at which of this work is being done, it was unexpected. A lot of that work is being done through simulation as well. And that also demonstrates the effectiveness of simulation if you start to think about the agility that we can bring to bear. Well, I think it's really very premature to talk about M&A, exactly what the long-term implication on M&A is going to be. Obviously, we continue to have a pipeline of customers of potential companies that we're continuing to evaluate. And we -- and b, we're evaluating those customers, I mean, if those companies, if you look at what we did with the acquisition of Lumerical, we just closed Lumerical a couple of -- a few weeks ago. During the lockdown period, we were able to onboard all their employees remotely. But we continue to engage with potential acquisition targets. We'll see what happens as the situation plays out. Thank you very much. So I'd like to close by saying that while there is uncertainty in the market, I know that ANSYS has the right team, the best products in the market and strong customer commitments. With our investments in infrastructure and collaboration technologies, the special accommodations for our customers and with our continued fiscal discipline, I believe that ANSYS is well positioned to help our customers during this critical time and well into the future. When this crisis is abated, I believe that we will emerge in an even better leadership position to make simulation pervasive across the product life cycle. I'd like to again acknowledge our more than 4,000 employees around the world who have managed to grow our customer base and support our existing customers during these challenging times. Thank you all so very much. We are ONE Ansys. And finally, I'd like to encourage all of you to join us online at Simulation World, June 10th and 11th. You can find more information and register on the ANSYS website or by going to simulationworld.com. And thank you for joining the call. Be safe and enjoy the rest of your day."

I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, and largest quarter in our history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including ACV, revenue, earnings per share and cash flow. Q4 was the capstone to an excellent year, in which we grew ACV by 16% in constant currency. Our industry-leading product portfolio, strong execution and growing market enabled us to beat and raise our guidance each quarter of 2021. We saw strength across all major industries, geographies and go-to-market routes over the course of the year. Our direct and indirect channels grew at double-digit. Similarly, each of our go-to-market customer segment, enterprise, strategic and volume accounts, all grew by double-digit. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top industry and each demonstrated robust year-over-year growth. From a geographical perspective, we saw strong performance with each region going ACV at double-digit. I'm also pleased that we saw broad-based growth consistent with our expectations across product lines from our more established flagship products in structures, fluids, electromagnetics and semiconductors to our newer offerings such as optic, material and digital mission engineering. Our customer relationship continue to be strong and are helping to fuel the growth. In Q4, one of our key contracts came from Asia Pacific, a five-year multimillion dollar agreement with LG Electronics. This longtime customer uses ANSYS simulation to enable resource efficient production by significantly reducing material use, cost and the number of redesigns. That sustainability initiative has enabled the electronics giant to use high-quality next-generation products faster than expected, while reducing its carbon footprint. I'm also excited that Fraunhofer, a German research organization with 76 institutes spread across the country, standardized on the ANSYS simulation platform with a three-year seven-figure contract in Q4. It's researchers and engineers will use the entire ANSYS portfolio to support innovation efforts in the automotive, chemical, energy, aerospace and healthcare segments. Our ongoing broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us even greater confidence for a prospect in 2022 and beyond. We expect our 2022 ACV to go at about 10% at the midpoint in constant currency, which positions ANSYS to surpass our long-term target of $2 billion in ACV. Nicole will walk you through a guidance for 2022 in a moment. During these calls, I often highlight different aspects of our technology. For example, I discussed our solutions for optical simulation on the last call, and our unparalleled product scalability in August of 2021. Given the strength of our semiconductor, electronics business in Q4, I'd like to spend a little bit more time discussing that important segment. Based with mounting customer expectations, today semiconductor companies operate at the cutting edge of innovation and their products are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Furthermore, some systems companies are turning to custom-built bespoke silicon to give the product an edge. At a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars for advanced process node tape out, the cost of failure is prohibitively expensive. The semiconductor and system companies are maximizing their likelihood of success by turning to technologies like scalable multiphysics simulation from ANSYS to develop advanced process node, and topologies like 3D and 2.5-D multi-die chip assemblies. A key deal in Q4 was a multiyear agreement with AMD, a global leader in high-performance computing and visualization product. AMD is the longtime ANSYS strategic customer. This new contract reflects AMD's rapid growth and the expanded use of ANSYS simulation and signoff tools. As a result, AMD's global engineering teams have increased access to ANSYS solutions, improving collaboration and organization across the company. Customers are also using ANSYS electromagnetic simulation to prevent electromagnetic interference and to ensure signal integrity. Our best-in-class structural and fluid simulation a critical to predicting cooling and thermal warping and to ensuring reliable IC package design. Customers are relying on our optical simulation to ensure the success of high-speed photonics interconductivity amongst data-hungry systems. And they are leveraging our safety solutions. For example, a large semiconductor supplier to the automotive industry is using ANSYS to support workflow that graphically link semiconductor design to key functions within the electronics architecture for electric vehicle battery management system. Customers can rely on ANSYS, because we continue to drive significant technological advances into the marketplace. In our recently released ANSYS 2022 R1, we introduce breakthrough new semiconductor functionality that targets DVD or dynamic voltage drop, which is traditionally been difficult to model and understand. DVD is a drop in the voltage rails cause by high transient current drawn from the power grid. It is analogous to your house lights dimming for a moment when air-conditioning turns on. Our new technology Sigma DVD is a powerful approach that significantly increases coverage of dynamic voltage drop. With this functionality we are empowering our customers to move from simulating triplets to simulating an entire chip for all switching scenarios We believe this breakthrough will spur innovation throughout semiconductor industry. ANSYS has always advocated for open ecosystems, which allow for best-of-breed interoperability and give our customers the ability to make the right decisions for their unique businesses. This is particularly important for semiconductor and systems companies. And that is why we partner with Foundry and other leading software companies. As part of our partnership, Synopsis has integrated ANSYS electronic solutions into its 3D IC compiler for highly accurate signal thermal and power data. The automated back annotation amongst these solutions enables faster convergence with fewer iterations to enable customers to bring next generation products to market faster. Earlier in 2021, we signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with a major semiconductor company, which standard on ANSYS' multiphysics solutions including ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk-SC for the latest finFET technologies and advanced 3d IC techniques. Not only was this customer able to realize the benefits from ANSYS products, but it was able to drive faster time to value. Thanks to our integration with synopsis's best-in-class technologies. Moving to our semiconductor foundry partners. Samsung Foundry has certified ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for developing advanced systems on chip as well as for 3d ICs. That industry first certification enabled ANSYS to help Samsung designers, as well as Samsung foundry customers more accurately analyze and mitigate risks from electromagnetic effects when adopting Samsung's new sign-off flow. In Q4 TSMC named ANSYS as an OIP partner of the year for a joint development of four nanometer design infrastructure, which led to the certification of ANSYS RedHawk-SC enhances Totem for TSMC's most advanced three and four nanometer processes. TSMC honored us with an award for our development of ANSYS RedHawk-SC electrothermal for full chip and package thermal analysis. ANSYS has also partnered with Intel Foundry Services to become an inaugural member of the design ecosystem alliance. Through this alliance, Intel will use ANSYS's market-leading multi-physics solutions to enable Intel customers to create unique chips with tailor-made silicon. Turning to our environmental, social and governance initiatives. ANSYS and 3M have launched a material modeling training program that is helping engineers refine product development processes and reduce material waste. 3M is offering verified material models for its tape and adhesive products to all ANSYS users to help power environmental, sustainability initiatives. Finally, I'm excited that ANSYS has recently been recognized for our product innovation, as well as for our winning culture. The international society for optics and photonics presented the Prism Award in software for our OpticStudio STAR Module. This technology streamlines optical designs while reducing design errors, development time and material costs. ANSYS has also been recognized by the great places to work institute as a preferred employer in China, Japan South Korea and Taiwan. That is a testament to our colleagues in Asia, as well as to our culture of innovation. In summary, Q4 was a great quarter capping off an exceptional year for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all our key financial metrics and we delivered the best year in company history. Thanks to our market leading portfolio and our deep customer relationships, our customers are continuing to grow their ANSYS simulation for products as diverse as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, rocket ships and life-saving medical devices. Those factors combined with the momentum we experience in Q4 will propel us through this year and beyond. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you Ajei. Good morning everyone. Let me start off by saying that financially 2021 was our strongest year ever. And we are optimistic about 2022 given the momentum in our business. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2021, we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. And this is especially noteworthy as we've raised our full year guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for all three quarters throughout the course of the year. Additionally, in 2021, we achieved new company records across key financial metrics including ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in 2021 with each of our customer segments and geographic regions growing double digits. Despite the lingering uncertainties around the pandemic, we saw growth across all industries as well as all product lines. Our wide-ranging growth is evidence of the critical capabilities our products deliver to our customers. 2021 was an outstanding year and we are entering 2022 with momentum and a strong backlog. Now, let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. And then I will provide our outlook and key assumptions for 2022 and Q1. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $755.4 million in Q4, which grew year-over-year 14% or 16% in constant currency. For the full year we recognized $1.9 billion in ACV growing 16% in both reported and constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. For the full year, ACV from recurring sources represented 81% of the total. Q4 total revenue was $661.4 million and grew 5% or 8% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion and grew 14% in both reported and constant currency. We had strong top line performance in 2021 with ACV and revenue both growing double digits at 16% and 14% respectively. At our 2019 Investor Day, we outlined our business model of double-digit growth including tuck-in M&A in both the fourth quarter and full year we executed against this business model. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.3 billion, which grew 30% year-over-year. During the quarter we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid fourth quarter growth margin of 92.3% and an operating margin of 46.8%, which was better than our guidance. We had full year gross margin of 90.5% and operating margin of 41.4%. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming revenue. The result with fourth quarter EPS of $2.81, which was also better than our guidance. For the full year EPS was $7.37, similar to operating margin EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was 19%, Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter totaled $101.7 million, which benefited from strong collections. For the full year we had operating cash flows of 4549.5 million. We ended the quarter with $668 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares during the quarter for around $99 million. For the full year we repurchased approximately 347,000 shares for around $135 million. We have 2.5 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We expect the momentum we saw in 2021 to continue, which gives us confidence as we look ahead to 2022. As Ajei mentioned, our 2022 full-year ACV guidance surpasses the $2 billion goal we laid out at our 2019 Investor Day. We are also on our model of double digit growth including tuck-in MA with industry leading margins. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We expect our full-year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.050 billion. This represents growth of 6.4 to 9.6% or 8.3% to 11.5% in constant currency. We have a balanced and diversified business, which is driving the broad-based performance and double-digit ACV growth at constant currency that we expect to see in 2022. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.040 billion to $2.110 billion, which is growth of 5.6% to 9.2% or 7.4% to 11.1% in constant currency. Let me touch on some of the assumptions considered in our full year guidance. We continue to expect broad-based growth and continued momentum from our large enterprise customers and SMB customers. We also assume that going forward we have a more normalized mix of business with our subscription lease licenses growing faster than perpetual licenses. As a result, ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue as the business model shifts to subscription lease licenses continues. Additionally, our full year guidance is based on how we see our book of business and pipeline today. As a result, we have assumed a neutral inflationary impact to our top line. However we have assumed a moderate impact from inflation on expenses. This brings me to our operating margin guidance. We expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. As a result we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.64 to $8.10. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 18%, which is one point lower than the 19% rate we had in 2021 due to recurring tax savings expected from tax planning initiatives. Now, let me turn to our full-year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $580 million to $620 million. We expect to see significant growth in operating cash flow levels year-over-year driven by strong operating leverage in our business model. However, our cash guidance absorbs the negative impact of approximately $60 million to $80 million in additional cash income taxes. This is driven by RNE capitalization tax legislation and other law changes that impact tax years starting January 1st, 2022. Although our overall 2022 tax rate is expected to be lower. The effect of the law changes the timing of cash tax payments, which creates near-term cash flow headwinds that will normalize through the amortization dynamics that occur over time. While there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers the requirement to capitalize RNE, we are including higher cash taxes in our current outlook, as we will be required to make these payments unless the existing law is amended. This legislation impacts timing of cash flow. It has no impact on our ability to operationally grow cash flow and does not create any incremental expense obligation. We remain optimistic about our cash generation in both the short and the long term. As you can calculate from our guidance, our current outlook absorbing the timing impact expects operating cash flows to grow faster than ACV in 2022. Additionally, since quarterly operating cash flow can be volatile, growth in our full-year cash outlook continues to be the best measure of success. We have seen significant currency volatility so far in 2022. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $34 million and on operating cash flow by approximately $12 million. Further details around specific currency rates, changes in tax legislation and other receipts, changes in tax legislation and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q1 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Now turning to guidance for the first quarter. This year we will provide quarterly ACV guidance to help with your modeling. As a reminder annual ACV is the best metric to observe the momentum in our business. We expect first quarter ACV in the range of $328 million to $348 million, revenue in the range of $395 million to $420 million, operating margin in the range of 29.1% to 31.9% and EPS in the range of a $1.05 to $1.22. Heading into 2022, we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for another outstanding quarter topping off a fantastic year. Despite a continued challenging macro environment, we delivered broad-based growth. The team's exceptional operational discipline and customer centricity enables us to meet or exceed our internal models across every geography and customer segment and deliver extraordinary value to our customers across the globe. We continue to build on that momentum, invest in our business, while executing against our strategic priorities and we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Mr. John Walsh, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Good morning everyone.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nJohn Walsh: Can you hear me all right?\nAjei Gopal: Yes.\nJohn Walsh: Okay, great. Well, nice performance in the quarter start off there. Really my questions are first, how should we think about the SG&A costs for 2022? Maybe what's the incremental annualized from M&A, some of the inflationary pressures you talked about, and then obviously also growth investments? And then the second question, just to make sure I have the tax adjustment correct to the cash flow. If we get an amendment from the government which I think at least in our coverage there's some companies that believe that'll happen. Would we just reverse out that $70 million, is it as simple as that? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. Thanks John. Yes. So I'll answer your second question first and then the first question. So yes, if there was legislation that delayed or repeal the law that $60 million to $80 million would be added back to the cash flow outlook. Now that is that is pending. Any changes in tax law that could occur as a result of that repeal. So if it was just a straight repeal of that or delay of that then that would be the right interpretation. From an SG&A standpoint, I think the way to think about it is that it would be fairly consistent from an [Indiscernible] standpoint overall. Do we lose you?\nJohn Walsh: Sorry, I was on mute there. That's great. Thank you for taking the questions. I'll pass it along.\nNicole Anasenes: Okay. Thanks so much John.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, let me start with you with a question concerning the 2022 R1 release. One of the interesting components of the release was the reference to what you call custom workspaces or perhaps otherwise known as industry solutions. Could you comment on your broader plan or vision for packaging the software in that way with these custom work spaces for additional industries than the one you started with R1. How do you think this might affect your multi-solution sales over time, for example? And perhaps since you have such a large focus on process in the release, how you think this might affect your demand for Minerva over time? And then for you Nicole, according to the 10-k there was a very large increase in your expected revenue from RPO for 2022. Quite considerable increase in fact versus a year ago and from Q3. Is that mostly an artifact of the number of large transactions that you concluded in Q4? And is this perhaps a new more normal level of expected revenue coming out of RPO for the next 12 month periods?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. Okay. Jay, good morning first. Let me take the first question and then I'll hand it over to Nicole for the second. So the point that you're making actually is a very good point. We have invested in creating a comprehensive platform that supports simulation. And that platform allows for workflow, it allows for data management, it allows for a number of other elements that come together and allow us to move from being a provider of tools to a broader provider of solutions. And so for example one of the things that you saw in our 2021 -- 2022 R1 release was with ANSYS Fluent where we now have a dedicated aerospace workflow that tailors the UI, the user interface to external aerodynamic simulations. So that delivers built-in atmospheric conditions. It optimizes solver settings, relevant input and output parameters and so on. So that's an example of the power that we can bring to bear as a result of the investments that we've made. And of course you can see some of those being reflected throughout the portfolio. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And so, Jay, to your question on the deferred revenue and backlog balance. Yes, you're correct. We closed the quarter with deferred revenue and backlog were about a 1.3 billion and that grew about 30% year-over-year. Now the strong growth came from the great momentum we've been seeing in our business and the success of the sales strategy to shift the business model to multi-year subscription leases. So to the point that you made earlier about strong multi-year performance. Now Q4 was especially strong because of the timing of some of the start dates of contracts executed in Q4. And since some -- since these contracts were signed before Q4 ended these contractual obligations are included in the deferred revenue backlog balance at the end of the year. But if you normalized for some of these contractual commitments which had later start dates, the growth would still be really strong. It would be close to the mid-teens. And so, I would say that overall really strong performance.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. Maybe one quick follow-up. Any update on the adoption of ANSYS cloud. You did announce the new relationship with AWS recently at the EDA Conference in December. There was considerable focus by ANSYS at the conference on your cloud work with Microsoft. Perhaps you could comment on that as well? Thanks.\nAjei Gopal: So Jay, I think to better understand the cloud strategy, it might just take me a moment to maybe repeat or to summarize for what -- how ANSYS takes advantage of the cloud and what's important to customers. So let's consider a typical enterprise application that's not simulation. So typical enterprise application like an ERP system for example. It enables some workflows and data sharing between users and a user interaction with that application typically involves something like a database lookup and a database update. The amount of compute power that's required is small and predictable and that allows the application vendor, the SasS vendor to choose a cloud for their application based on their criteria. The application runs in the vendor's instance in that cloud and the vendor will typically charge a customer a fee to use the application based on the number of users or other metrics. Now, with simulation, simulation is very different from the traditional enterprise application in that the amount of compute required to launch simulation can be enormous. So a single simulation can run for hours across hundreds of cores. A single user can launch multiple simulations in parallel. And that can translate into a lot of compute and related costs. And that's why high performance computing or HPC at scale is so important to us and to our customers. Now, historically customers have run HPC workloads in their own data centers, so their own private clouds if you will. And simulation has been one of the more demanding workloads. Now as a cost of and the availability of HPC has come down in the public cloud, some of our customers are working directly with the hyperscale cloud vendors to migrate or augment their private clouds with HPC in the public cloud. And so, a customer might often do this in the context of a broad data center update strategy in which multiple workloads including the HPC workload are being migrated to the public cloud. And obviously different customers will pick different hyperscale public cloud providers depending on the terms and the needs and the commercial arrangements and so forth. So there are two conclusions, Jay, to draw from these facts. The first is that it's essential for us to support HPC on multiple hyperscale cloud providers. And the second is because simulation workload could be run on premises in a private cloud one day and it could be run in the public cloud the next, we have to support flexible licensing. And specifically we must allow customers to be able to purchase incremental elastic licenses to support their public cloud simulation work, as well as giving them the ability to bring and use the licenses that they may have used on premises to bring it to the cloud. So that's the essence of our strategy. And we've continued to support our customers with flexible licensing as they use ANSYS products and in the public cloud of their choice. So you mentioned a couple of -- a couple of announcements. So first let me talk about ANSYS cloud. This is a product we've had in the market for a while. And I've spoken of it before. It's built on Azure. It supports flexible licensing. It allows our customers to take advantage of scale out compute on the Azure cloud running on the ANSYS managed instance. ANSYS cloud revenues customer usage are both growing. We've seen a ForEx increase in compute usage year over year. The second product that we refer to which we announced earlier this year is in collaboration with Amazon web services. The ANSYS' gateway powered by AWS, it provides a seamless access and deployment of ANSYS products on AWS. It offers scalability and flexibility. It allows customers to maintain their existing AWS relationships by pairing their hardware access through AWS with their ANSYS software. In other words, the customers run on their own instance and not on the ANSYS instance. And so this obviously provides a path for monetization for AWS and of course for ANSYS as well. So that's the strategy, that's the context of those products and obviously, hopefully this explains what we're trying to accomplish.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yes. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Mr. Adam Borg of Stefil. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe just to follow up on the ANSYS gateway question. So, I understand that that ANSYS gateway native AWS, excuse me, that's a browser-based solution. Is the goal for the entire ANSYS portfolio to be made available over time on ANSYS gateway?\nAjei Gopal: So obviously, the intent is to make sure that our customers can take advantage of the portfolio of -- the ANSYS portfolio on the public cloud. And you should expect to see ANSYS products being broadly available on the cloud.\nAdam Borg: Great. And maybe just to follow up with more of a housekeeping question. Nicole, could you just comment on what the organic constant currency growth rate was for ACV and revenue just for the 4Q and also for calendar year 2021? Thank you so much.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So thanks Adam. We saw strong growth [Indiscernible]. So as you can calculate some prior guidance on the impact of DGI and that the same actually investigated before. In 2021, we had really stronger growth [ph].\nAdam Borg: Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Gal Munda of Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nGal Munda: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just around the commentary that we're getting on the automotive and just in general transportation industry, but maybe zooming out -- zooming in on the automotive side it's something that's been recovering after years of kind of subdued investment and now it seems like everyone's expanding the R&D expenditure there. In terms of what you're seeing in your results today when you're saying that those -- the vertical is starting to really ramp up. Would you say, it's the first inning of that or have you started seeing like the real benefit of electrification and obviously autonomy coming later down the line? So basically, is this another short cycle that is better off the weak cycle? Do you think this could start off a more substantial structural growth in the industry for you?\nAjei Gopal: Well, let me let me quickly take that, Gal. So when you think about the automotive industry, obviously, it's one of our Top Three verticals, electronics and semiconductors, automotive and ground transportation, aerospace, the top three verticals. It's an area where we've historically had a lot of strength. As you rightly point out, the areas where there is a lot of customer interest right now is in both electrification and autonomy. And a few years ago I would have said that there was a significantly more interest perhaps in autonomy as a possibly than more near-term activity. But what we're seeing right now is that some of the vendors or some of the OEMs have pulled back a little bit from their expectations maybe the more aggressive timelines they had. But a lot of the work that's on autonomy is going towards ADAS improving driver safety and so forth. So there continues to be lots of investment in that space even though full autonomy might be further away. As far as electrification is concerned, as you know, it's not just about the powertrain. Obviously when you're thinking about the powertrain and the electric, the transformation from the internal combustion engine into an electric motor, that's where our high fidelity multiphysics workflows come in that allows you to design better and more thermal efficient motors and batteries and power electronic components, all of that is part of the electrified powertrain. But in addition there is a change. It's not just about changing the internal combustion engine to an electric motor. This is an opportunity to rethink and redesign the car. And so that means, there's more analysis, for example, for safety and understanding what failure modes look like. More analysis on a noise and vibration and understanding what the ambience within the or the ambient experience in the car cabin is going to look like, on crash analysis and impact analysis. So there's a number of different areas, all of which where we have -- all of which we have strength in, which companies are pursuing in their pursuit of electrification. So we're very excited about the work that's taking place. And we see this as being an ongoing long-term tailwind for us in that particular vertical.\nAnalyst: That's really helpful. Thank you, Ajei. And then maybe Nicole, just the question on the guidance when you think about the ACV growth and the ACV number crossing that two billion for the first time. What are you assuming underlying in terms of the recurring ACV as a proportion of ACV as you have? Is the recent trends of going crossing the 80% in recurring? Is that what you're assuming in that? In other words, is that -- could there be increment of a little headwind for the next couple of years coming from the fact that you are assuming to sign more recurring deals versus perpetual?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. That is definitely implicit in our guidance is that, as you recall in 2020 there was a more -- there was more of a trough around perpetual 2021 reflected I'd say kind of getting back to the normal level of perpetual we had. So our underlying view is that the momentum of customers is moving towards time-based licensing and that will continue over time as the business model has shifted pretty substantially towards that over the past five years. And so, our underlying assumption in 2022 is that the mix is a little bit more normalized. And as a result, ACV is growing faster than revenue as a result of that mixed compare dynamic.\nAnalyst: Sure. That's perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Tyler Radke, Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you Ajei about some of the semiconductor deals that you did this quarter. Seemed like there was a lot of activity between some of the certification on Samsung's three and four nanometer, as well as number of eight figure deals. I guess just a couple questions. I guess when you when you are building out these partnerships, are you seeing kind of your semiconductor customers take on more your products. I guess or is this a number of solutions beyond just RedHawk on the kind of the leading node processes. And then more broadly as you think about some of the multi-year chip shortages that semiconductor companies are facing. Like how is this kind of changing their road map for using ANSYS products? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. So, when you think about our involvement with semiconductor companies and as I mentioned this, obviously, the companies have been historically doing semis as well as some of the system companies that are doing semis. There's obviously been a lot more activity in that space. What we are able to bring to bear is the entirety of the portfolio. And I mentioned some of this during my script. Look when you think about 3D ICs for example, that's really where you can scale performance and functionality across multiple dyes in a single package. And that requires an integrated multiphysics approach. And that includes simulating for example, the structures, the optics, the photonics electromagnetics, all of those are outside of the traditional RedHawk product line, right? So it's HFSS and others. So, when you think about these complex designs. And then certainly when you move beyond the chip itself and you think about chip package system for electronics, it really brings in -- brings to bear the entirety of a portfolio. So, and I gave you an example also in the script of a company that's using some of our safety analysis providing automotive -- providing semiconductors for the automotive industry and how our safety analysis work, which might seem counterintuitive or unintuitive. The safety analysis work is relevant at the semiconductor level all the way up to the larger automotive level. So those are examples of how our portfolio is being used. But we feel like we have a lot to offer our customers, because of the multiphysics investments that we've made over the years and the strength of the portfolio.\nTyler Radke: Great. And just on the second point of the question just around the supply chain constraints and semiconductor shortage. Like do you think that's kind of further evangelizing or increasing the amount of simulation that semiconductor companies are deploying?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. Look, I think for the shortage of semiconductors, obviously, there's a challenge in terms of being able to get semiconductors to where they need to be used and we're seeing this across multiple industries, that hasn't fundamentally affected the design activity. And that's really where we come in. We work with our customers on the design as opposed to the manufacturing of their products. And obviously, part of what we're doing with respect to the certifications with the foundries is to make sure that we are in a position to support them with our technologies as they go into to the foundry. But those are examples of us proactively working to make sure that the industry is able to move forward. But look it's -- we're not tied to manufacturing. We tied to design. And that's really primarily -- that's across all of our product lines. And so, even if a semiconductor shortage causes a shortage for example or some delay on an assembly line in a automotive company, again it doesn't affect the design work that we're involved with in the automotive company. So that's I think the strength of the ANSYS business and that gives us confidence in the way we think about our business going forward.\nTyler Radke: Great. And then just one last one for Nicole. If I look at your guidance on constant currency organic ACV for this year, it's a few points higher than the initial guidance that you gave last year. So just wanted to understand kind of what's giving you that that level of confidence especially comping a pretty strong year? Any changes in kind of your guidance philosophy or is it maybe the strong backlog number that's giving you that confidence? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean, I would say, fundamentally 2021 was a really strong year. And I'd say, if you compare to where we were at the beginning of last year, we had just come off of a really significant compare dynamic around Q4 2020, right? But the underlying momentum of the business as you could see through the full year of beat and raise, definitely exceeded our expectations as we exited 2021. So going into 2022, our expectation is that guidance will -- or that performance will continue to be broad-based, it was broad-based across customer sets, geographies, industries, I mean it was pretty consistent. And so, I would say that that's the primary factor in the underlying confidence around what we consider to be a pretty strong expectation of double-digit growth of 10% at the midpoint in ACV.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to build off, Tyler's question just now, but perhaps this one targeted in the direction of Ajei. Just thinking about that that ACV growth number next year, any changes in the strategic priorities that you might be focusing on whether it's a go-to-market, end markets, partnerships that we should be thinking about that might help kind of influence the growth either at the lower or the high end of those targets?\nAjei Gopal: Well, as I said in my script, if you look back in 2020 to 2021 and certainly Q4 as well. In 2021, we saw strength across all major industries, across all major geographies, across all of our major go-to-market routes. And we saw growth in both direct as well as indirect. We saw growth -- if you look at the pyramid with enterprise customers at the tippy top and the volume accounts at the bottom of the pyramid, we saw growth across the customer segments. And the regions contributed there, they all grew double digits from ACV perspective last year. And the product lines kind of grew as expected. So I feel very good about all of that. That just should go goes to show that the business is performing across multiple dimensions in a way that you would want to have happen. And so, part of our plan going forward is to continue to be able to build on that momentum into 2022.\nKen Wong: Got it. Got it. And then, for Nicole, just wanted to ask about on the operating margin side. When we think about that 41%, 42%, is this more -- is there a heavier amount of catch-up spend inflation that's embedded in there relative to a typical year? And potentially we can see that is -- I don't want to say trough, but kind of abnormally lower than typical? Or is this generally just a heavier investment cycle that we should be thinking about? And just love some thoughts and color on kind of what's baked into the spend dynamics?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So, let me just start by saying, and I think I've mentioned this a couple time is that, we're committed to industry leading margins and the ANSYS business model is highly efficient. We have substantial operating leverage and low variable costs. Now, in our 2022 published guidance, you can see that operating leverage in the business model, When the guidance projects ACV to be stronger than revenue growth and cash flow to grow faster than ACV. And that cash flow growth is after absorbing the impact of R&E capitalization, right? Now, in terms of operating margin specifically, revenue growth headwinds from expected license mix really is the primary driver of those operating margin headwinds. And that dynamic is more about accounting in the P&L than operating leverage. The operating leverage really can be seen in those underlying dynamics between ACV and cash flow. Now, in addition, I mentioned in the prepared remarks in both cash flow and operating margin, we do have assumptions of a moderate impact of inflation on expenses. And so that is a bit of a headwind to both. But I would say primarily it's the underlying dynamic around just accounting and where revenue is this year relative to ACV.\nKen Wong: Got it. Fantastic. Thank you so much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hey guys. It's Saket. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Ajei, maybe for you. It was a very helpful explanation earlier just around ANSYS strategy for simulation in the cloud. And certainly got the message across around flexible licensing as customers can choose either private or public. I guess maybe the follow-up question to that though is, in just the years that you've been in ANSYS, have you seen any changes I guess in that trend on customers preferring one versus the other? And how do you think about that going forward?\nAjei Gopal: Well, it's like, if you go back to the years that I've been with ANSYS. So if you go back five six years ago, obviously, the use of public cloud for HPC was much lower than it is today. And today the hyperscalers or the hyperscale public cloud providers have invested in building out HPC infrastructures. And they're all working with their customer bases. And as I think about our own customers, some of our customers are working with hyperscalers to figure out what their long-term data center strategy is going to look like. Do they continue to invest in their own data centers? Or they do take advantage of the public cloud -- some combination of the two where you have a hybrid structure where some stuff is running on-prem and you use the cloud as a burst capacity or for peak load periods or things of that nature. So, those are conversations that are ongoing. I think everyone realizes that there's now investment in the public cloud to support high performance computing and their high performance computing nodes. And so that's obviously a possibility that's available to our customers. From our perspective, one of the watch we're experience has always been flexibility to support and meet our customers where they want. And so, we are in a position to support our customers if they want to take advantage of our ANSYS cloud product, we can take it -- we can support them. And we can make it very easy for them to take advantage of the public cloud. If they want to run completely on premises, we can support that, and they can continue to do that. If they want to run on another public cloud, we can support that. So we -- if they want to run on Amazon, we are in a position to support that. In Azure, we're in a position to support that. So it's really -- it really is a flexible structure that we have in place. And I believe that this is exactly what customers are looking for that choice and flexibility on something as important to them as where they're computing and the cost of the compute that they're driving.\nSaket Kalia: That makes sense. Nicole, maybe my follow-up for you. I actually missed what you said earlier just on the organic constant currency ACV growth in 2021. Could you just recap that for us? And as part of that, can you just remind us how much Zemax is adding in? Or maybe just broadly, what the organic constant currency ACV growth is assumed in the 2022 guide?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. Ye, I apologize. I had some technical difficulties earlier, so apologize for those who couldn't hear my answer. Yes. So, for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our ACV growth in constant currency was 16%. And when you back out the $86 million to $88 million associated with the combination of AGI and Zemax, You can see that's really strong organic growth both in the quarter and for the full year. Now, as we move into 2022, we're really pleased with ACV guidance of approximately 10% at constant currency at the midpoint. And again, on that business model of double digit growth including tuck-in M&A. And within 2022, we still expect Zemax to have an inorganic impact of about $20 million.\nSaket Kalia: That's very clear. Thanks very much guys.\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: So, first question about cash flow. If you exclude the $60 million, $80 million incremental drag from the U.S. R&D tax credit change. 2022 for cash flow guidance is actually a nice step up from last year. What are the key factors driving the improvement and free cash flow conversion? How sustainable it is going forward?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean, I would say, as we go -- as we exited, went throughout 2021 and going into 2022, we saw more of a return to a more normalized collection environments past new environments. And so, the underlying momentum of the business and collections is quite strong. And in addition to that in the 2022 guidance, as I had mentioned in my earlier answer, there's significant operating leverage in the business overall around ACV. So although, operating margins overall are relatively flat, but on an -- when you compare the cash flow generation against ACV, because ACV is growing faster than revenue, you really see strong operating leverage. So it's a combination of the underlying momentum of kind of getting back to more normalized collection patterns and the underlying operating leverage in the business that has really driven the strength of the performance going into 2022.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a broader question. Philosophically, how do you think about the share price when considering buybacks versus M&A opportunities? And do you have any constraints really given that the balance sheet here on the $100 million debt?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. No. I mean, obviously, the strength of the cash generation of the business and the balance sheet are great assets. And over the years the greatest return we've been able to provide to shareholders is the deployment of access cash using it to acquire premier simulation technologies to fill out the portfolio, to complete what's already the broadest and the deepest portfolio. And last year, some -- sometimes there's just not the right timing or there's nothing imminent to deploy that cash against, so we're not -- there's not something that's going to deliver the right return for shareholders and so in those times we do repurchase shares. Last year we repurchased about 347,000 shares for about $135 million. And so, we would expect to continue to think along those lines of how we think about capital allocation overall.\nAndrew Obin: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nKelsey DeBriyn: So, thank you everyone for us. That's all the time we have today. I'm going to turn it over to Ajei, for some closing comments.\nAjei Gopal: Thanks, Kelsey. Once again, I am excited by the excellent progress that ANSYS has made in 2021. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success. Your work along with our broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us greater confidence for our prospects in 2022 and beyond. Thank you all for joining today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, and largest quarter in our history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including ACV, revenue, earnings per share and cash flow. Q4 was the capstone to an excellent year, in which we grew ACV by 16% in constant currency. Our industry-leading product portfolio, strong execution and growing market enabled us to beat and raise our guidance each quarter of 2021. We saw strength across all major industries, geographies and go-to-market routes over the course of the year. Our direct and indirect channels grew at double-digit. Similarly, each of our go-to-market customer segment, enterprise, strategic and volume accounts, all grew by double-digit. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top industry and each demonstrated robust year-over-year growth. From a geographical perspective, we saw strong performance with each region going ACV at double-digit. I'm also pleased that we saw broad-based growth consistent with our expectations across product lines from our more established flagship products in structures, fluids, electromagnetics and semiconductors to our newer offerings such as optic, material and digital mission engineering. Our customer relationship continue to be strong and are helping to fuel the growth. In Q4, one of our key contracts came from Asia Pacific, a five-year multimillion dollar agreement with LG Electronics. This longtime customer uses ANSYS simulation to enable resource efficient production by significantly reducing material use, cost and the number of redesigns. That sustainability initiative has enabled the electronics giant to use high-quality next-generation products faster than expected, while reducing its carbon footprint. I'm also excited that Fraunhofer, a German research organization with 76 institutes spread across the country, standardized on the ANSYS simulation platform with a three-year seven-figure contract in Q4. It's researchers and engineers will use the entire ANSYS portfolio to support innovation efforts in the automotive, chemical, energy, aerospace and healthcare segments. Our ongoing broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us even greater confidence for a prospect in 2022 and beyond. We expect our 2022 ACV to go at about 10% at the midpoint in constant currency, which positions ANSYS to surpass our long-term target of $2 billion in ACV. Nicole will walk you through a guidance for 2022 in a moment. During these calls, I often highlight different aspects of our technology. For example, I discussed our solutions for optical simulation on the last call, and our unparalleled product scalability in August of 2021. Given the strength of our semiconductor, electronics business in Q4, I'd like to spend a little bit more time discussing that important segment. Based with mounting customer expectations, today semiconductor companies operate at the cutting edge of innovation and their products are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Furthermore, some systems companies are turning to custom-built bespoke silicon to give the product an edge. At a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars for advanced process node tape out, the cost of failure is prohibitively expensive. The semiconductor and system companies are maximizing their likelihood of success by turning to technologies like scalable multiphysics simulation from ANSYS to develop advanced process node, and topologies like 3D and 2.5-D multi-die chip assemblies. A key deal in Q4 was a multiyear agreement with AMD, a global leader in high-performance computing and visualization product. AMD is the longtime ANSYS strategic customer. This new contract reflects AMD's rapid growth and the expanded use of ANSYS simulation and signoff tools. As a result, AMD's global engineering teams have increased access to ANSYS solutions, improving collaboration and organization across the company. Customers are also using ANSYS electromagnetic simulation to prevent electromagnetic interference and to ensure signal integrity. Our best-in-class structural and fluid simulation a critical to predicting cooling and thermal warping and to ensuring reliable IC package design. Customers are relying on our optical simulation to ensure the success of high-speed photonics interconductivity amongst data-hungry systems. And they are leveraging our safety solutions. For example, a large semiconductor supplier to the automotive industry is using ANSYS to support workflow that graphically link semiconductor design to key functions within the electronics architecture for electric vehicle battery management system. Customers can rely on ANSYS, because we continue to drive significant technological advances into the marketplace. In our recently released ANSYS 2022 R1, we introduce breakthrough new semiconductor functionality that targets DVD or dynamic voltage drop, which is traditionally been difficult to model and understand. DVD is a drop in the voltage rails cause by high transient current drawn from the power grid. It is analogous to your house lights dimming for a moment when air-conditioning turns on. Our new technology Sigma DVD is a powerful approach that significantly increases coverage of dynamic voltage drop. With this functionality we are empowering our customers to move from simulating triplets to simulating an entire chip for all switching scenarios We believe this breakthrough will spur innovation throughout semiconductor industry. ANSYS has always advocated for open ecosystems, which allow for best-of-breed interoperability and give our customers the ability to make the right decisions for their unique businesses. This is particularly important for semiconductor and systems companies. And that is why we partner with Foundry and other leading software companies. As part of our partnership, Synopsis has integrated ANSYS electronic solutions into its 3D IC compiler for highly accurate signal thermal and power data. The automated back annotation amongst these solutions enables faster convergence with fewer iterations to enable customers to bring next generation products to market faster. Earlier in 2021, we signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with a major semiconductor company, which standard on ANSYS' multiphysics solutions including ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RedHawk-SC for the latest finFET technologies and advanced 3d IC techniques. Not only was this customer able to realize the benefits from ANSYS products, but it was able to drive faster time to value. Thanks to our integration with synopsis's best-in-class technologies. Moving to our semiconductor foundry partners. Samsung Foundry has certified ANSYS RaptorH electromagnetic simulation solution for developing advanced systems on chip as well as for 3d ICs. That industry first certification enabled ANSYS to help Samsung designers, as well as Samsung foundry customers more accurately analyze and mitigate risks from electromagnetic effects when adopting Samsung's new sign-off flow. In Q4 TSMC named ANSYS as an OIP partner of the year for a joint development of four nanometer design infrastructure, which led to the certification of ANSYS RedHawk-SC enhances Totem for TSMC's most advanced three and four nanometer processes. TSMC honored us with an award for our development of ANSYS RedHawk-SC electrothermal for full chip and package thermal analysis. ANSYS has also partnered with Intel Foundry Services to become an inaugural member of the design ecosystem alliance. Through this alliance, Intel will use ANSYS's market-leading multi-physics solutions to enable Intel customers to create unique chips with tailor-made silicon. Turning to our environmental, social and governance initiatives. ANSYS and 3M have launched a material modeling training program that is helping engineers refine product development processes and reduce material waste. 3M is offering verified material models for its tape and adhesive products to all ANSYS users to help power environmental, sustainability initiatives. Finally, I'm excited that ANSYS has recently been recognized for our product innovation, as well as for our winning culture. The international society for optics and photonics presented the Prism Award in software for our OpticStudio STAR Module. This technology streamlines optical designs while reducing design errors, development time and material costs. ANSYS has also been recognized by the great places to work institute as a preferred employer in China, Japan South Korea and Taiwan. That is a testament to our colleagues in Asia, as well as to our culture of innovation. In summary, Q4 was a great quarter capping off an exceptional year for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all our key financial metrics and we delivered the best year in company history. Thanks to our market leading portfolio and our deep customer relationships, our customers are continuing to grow their ANSYS simulation for products as diverse as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, rocket ships and life-saving medical devices. Those factors combined with the momentum we experience in Q4 will propel us through this year and beyond. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Good morning. Yes. Yes. Okay. Jay, good morning first. Let me take the first question and then I'll hand it over to Nicole for the second. So the point that you're making actually is a very good point. We have invested in creating a comprehensive platform that supports simulation. And that platform allows for workflow, it allows for data management, it allows for a number of other elements that come together and allow us to move from being a provider of tools to a broader provider of solutions. And so for example one of the things that you saw in our 2021 -- 2022 R1 release was with ANSYS Fluent where we now have a dedicated aerospace workflow that tailors the UI, the user interface to external aerodynamic simulations. So that delivers built-in atmospheric conditions. It optimizes solver settings, relevant input and output parameters and so on. So that's an example of the power that we can bring to bear as a result of the investments that we've made. And of course you can see some of those being reflected throughout the portfolio. Nicole? So Jay, I think to better understand the cloud strategy, it might just take me a moment to maybe repeat or to summarize for what -- how ANSYS takes advantage of the cloud and what's important to customers. So let's consider a typical enterprise application that's not simulation. So typical enterprise application like an ERP system for example. It enables some workflows and data sharing between users and a user interaction with that application typically involves something like a database lookup and a database update. The amount of compute power that's required is small and predictable and that allows the application vendor, the SasS vendor to choose a cloud for their application based on their criteria. The application runs in the vendor's instance in that cloud and the vendor will typically charge a customer a fee to use the application based on the number of users or other metrics. Now, with simulation, simulation is very different from the traditional enterprise application in that the amount of compute required to launch simulation can be enormous. So a single simulation can run for hours across hundreds of cores. A single user can launch multiple simulations in parallel. And that can translate into a lot of compute and related costs. And that's why high performance computing or HPC at scale is so important to us and to our customers. Now, historically customers have run HPC workloads in their own data centers, so their own private clouds if you will. And simulation has been one of the more demanding workloads. Now as a cost of and the availability of HPC has come down in the public cloud, some of our customers are working directly with the hyperscale cloud vendors to migrate or augment their private clouds with HPC in the public cloud. And so, a customer might often do this in the context of a broad data center update strategy in which multiple workloads including the HPC workload are being migrated to the public cloud. And obviously different customers will pick different hyperscale public cloud providers depending on the terms and the needs and the commercial arrangements and so forth. So there are two conclusions, Jay, to draw from these facts. The first is that it's essential for us to support HPC on multiple hyperscale cloud providers. And the second is because simulation workload could be run on premises in a private cloud one day and it could be run in the public cloud the next, we have to support flexible licensing. And specifically we must allow customers to be able to purchase incremental elastic licenses to support their public cloud simulation work, as well as giving them the ability to bring and use the licenses that they may have used on premises to bring it to the cloud. So that's the essence of our strategy. And we've continued to support our customers with flexible licensing as they use ANSYS products and in the public cloud of their choice. So you mentioned a couple of -- a couple of announcements. So first let me talk about ANSYS cloud. This is a product we've had in the market for a while. And I've spoken of it before. It's built on Azure. It supports flexible licensing. It allows our customers to take advantage of scale out compute on the Azure cloud running on the ANSYS managed instance. ANSYS cloud revenues customer usage are both growing. We've seen a ForEx increase in compute usage year over year. The second product that we refer to which we announced earlier this year is in collaboration with Amazon web services. The ANSYS' gateway powered by AWS, it provides a seamless access and deployment of ANSYS products on AWS. It offers scalability and flexibility. It allows customers to maintain their existing AWS relationships by pairing their hardware access through AWS with their ANSYS software. In other words, the customers run on their own instance and not on the ANSYS instance. And so this obviously provides a path for monetization for AWS and of course for ANSYS as well. So that's the strategy, that's the context of those products and obviously, hopefully this explains what we're trying to accomplish. So obviously, the intent is to make sure that our customers can take advantage of the portfolio of -- the ANSYS portfolio on the public cloud. And you should expect to see ANSYS products being broadly available on the cloud. Well, let me let me quickly take that, Gal. So when you think about the automotive industry, obviously, it's one of our Top Three verticals, electronics and semiconductors, automotive and ground transportation, aerospace, the top three verticals. It's an area where we've historically had a lot of strength. As you rightly point out, the areas where there is a lot of customer interest right now is in both electrification and autonomy. And a few years ago I would have said that there was a significantly more interest perhaps in autonomy as a possibly than more near-term activity. But what we're seeing right now is that some of the vendors or some of the OEMs have pulled back a little bit from their expectations maybe the more aggressive timelines they had. But a lot of the work that's on autonomy is going towards ADAS improving driver safety and so forth. So there continues to be lots of investment in that space even though full autonomy might be further away. As far as electrification is concerned, as you know, it's not just about the powertrain. Obviously when you're thinking about the powertrain and the electric, the transformation from the internal combustion engine into an electric motor, that's where our high fidelity multiphysics workflows come in that allows you to design better and more thermal efficient motors and batteries and power electronic components, all of that is part of the electrified powertrain. But in addition there is a change. It's not just about changing the internal combustion engine to an electric motor. This is an opportunity to rethink and redesign the car. And so that means, there's more analysis, for example, for safety and understanding what failure modes look like. More analysis on a noise and vibration and understanding what the ambience within the or the ambient experience in the car cabin is going to look like, on crash analysis and impact analysis. So there's a number of different areas, all of which where we have -- all of which we have strength in, which companies are pursuing in their pursuit of electrification. So we're very excited about the work that's taking place. And we see this as being an ongoing long-term tailwind for us in that particular vertical. Yes. So, when you think about our involvement with semiconductor companies and as I mentioned this, obviously, the companies have been historically doing semis as well as some of the system companies that are doing semis. There's obviously been a lot more activity in that space. What we are able to bring to bear is the entirety of the portfolio. And I mentioned some of this during my script. Look when you think about 3D ICs for example, that's really where you can scale performance and functionality across multiple dyes in a single package. And that requires an integrated multiphysics approach. And that includes simulating for example, the structures, the optics, the photonics electromagnetics, all of those are outside of the traditional RedHawk product line, right? So it's HFSS and others. So, when you think about these complex designs. And then certainly when you move beyond the chip itself and you think about chip package system for electronics, it really brings in -- brings to bear the entirety of a portfolio. So, and I gave you an example also in the script of a company that's using some of our safety analysis providing automotive -- providing semiconductors for the automotive industry and how our safety analysis work, which might seem counterintuitive or unintuitive. The safety analysis work is relevant at the semiconductor level all the way up to the larger automotive level. So those are examples of how our portfolio is being used. But we feel like we have a lot to offer our customers, because of the multiphysics investments that we've made over the years and the strength of the portfolio. Yes. Look, I think for the shortage of semiconductors, obviously, there's a challenge in terms of being able to get semiconductors to where they need to be used and we're seeing this across multiple industries, that hasn't fundamentally affected the design activity. And that's really where we come in. We work with our customers on the design as opposed to the manufacturing of their products. And obviously, part of what we're doing with respect to the certifications with the foundries is to make sure that we are in a position to support them with our technologies as they go into to the foundry. But those are examples of us proactively working to make sure that the industry is able to move forward. But look it's -- we're not tied to manufacturing. We tied to design. And that's really primarily -- that's across all of our product lines. And so, even if a semiconductor shortage causes a shortage for example or some delay on an assembly line in a automotive company, again it doesn't affect the design work that we're involved with in the automotive company. So that's I think the strength of the ANSYS business and that gives us confidence in the way we think about our business going forward. Well, as I said in my script, if you look back in 2020 to 2021 and certainly Q4 as well. In 2021, we saw strength across all major industries, across all major geographies, across all of our major go-to-market routes. And we saw growth in both direct as well as indirect. We saw growth -- if you look at the pyramid with enterprise customers at the tippy top and the volume accounts at the bottom of the pyramid, we saw growth across the customer segments. And the regions contributed there, they all grew double digits from ACV perspective last year. And the product lines kind of grew as expected. So I feel very good about all of that. That just should go goes to show that the business is performing across multiple dimensions in a way that you would want to have happen. And so, part of our plan going forward is to continue to be able to build on that momentum into 2022. Well, it's like, if you go back to the years that I've been with ANSYS. So if you go back five six years ago, obviously, the use of public cloud for HPC was much lower than it is today. And today the hyperscalers or the hyperscale public cloud providers have invested in building out HPC infrastructures. And they're all working with their customer bases. And as I think about our own customers, some of our customers are working with hyperscalers to figure out what their long-term data center strategy is going to look like. Do they continue to invest in their own data centers? Or they do take advantage of the public cloud -- some combination of the two where you have a hybrid structure where some stuff is running on-prem and you use the cloud as a burst capacity or for peak load periods or things of that nature. So, those are conversations that are ongoing. I think everyone realizes that there's now investment in the public cloud to support high performance computing and their high performance computing nodes. And so that's obviously a possibility that's available to our customers. From our perspective, one of the watch we're experience has always been flexibility to support and meet our customers where they want. And so, we are in a position to support our customers if they want to take advantage of our ANSYS cloud product, we can take it -- we can support them. And we can make it very easy for them to take advantage of the public cloud. If they want to run completely on premises, we can support that, and they can continue to do that. If they want to run on another public cloud, we can support that. So we -- if they want to run on Amazon, we are in a position to support that. In Azure, we're in a position to support that. So it's really -- it really is a flexible structure that we have in place. And I believe that this is exactly what customers are looking for that choice and flexibility on something as important to them as where they're computing and the cost of the compute that they're driving. Good morning. Thanks, Kelsey. Once again, I am excited by the excellent progress that ANSYS has made in 2021. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success. Your work along with our broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us greater confidence for our prospects in 2022 and beyond. Thank you all for joining today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you Ajei. Good morning everyone. Let me start off by saying that financially 2021 was our strongest year ever. And we are optimistic about 2022 given the momentum in our business. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2021, we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. And this is especially noteworthy as we've raised our full year guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for all three quarters throughout the course of the year. Additionally, in 2021, we achieved new company records across key financial metrics including ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in 2021 with each of our customer segments and geographic regions growing double digits. Despite the lingering uncertainties around the pandemic, we saw growth across all industries as well as all product lines. Our wide-ranging growth is evidence of the critical capabilities our products deliver to our customers. 2021 was an outstanding year and we are entering 2022 with momentum and a strong backlog. Now, let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. And then I will provide our outlook and key assumptions for 2022 and Q1. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $755.4 million in Q4, which grew year-over-year 14% or 16% in constant currency. For the full year we recognized $1.9 billion in ACV growing 16% in both reported and constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. For the full year, ACV from recurring sources represented 81% of the total. Q4 total revenue was $661.4 million and grew 5% or 8% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Full year revenue was $1.9 billion and grew 14% in both reported and constant currency. We had strong top line performance in 2021 with ACV and revenue both growing double digits at 16% and 14% respectively. At our 2019 Investor Day, we outlined our business model of double-digit growth including tuck-in M&A in both the fourth quarter and full year we executed against this business model. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.3 billion, which grew 30% year-over-year. During the quarter we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid fourth quarter growth margin of 92.3% and an operating margin of 46.8%, which was better than our guidance. We had full year gross margin of 90.5% and operating margin of 41.4%. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming revenue. The result with fourth quarter EPS of $2.81, which was also better than our guidance. For the full year EPS was $7.37, similar to operating margin EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was 19%, Our cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter totaled $101.7 million, which benefited from strong collections. For the full year we had operating cash flows of 4549.5 million. We ended the quarter with $668 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 250,000 shares during the quarter for around $99 million. For the full year we repurchased approximately 347,000 shares for around $135 million. We have 2.5 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We expect the momentum we saw in 2021 to continue, which gives us confidence as we look ahead to 2022. As Ajei mentioned, our 2022 full-year ACV guidance surpasses the $2 billion goal we laid out at our 2019 Investor Day. We are also on our model of double digit growth including tuck-in MA with industry leading margins. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We expect our full-year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.990 billion to $2.050 billion. This represents growth of 6.4 to 9.6% or 8.3% to 11.5% in constant currency. We have a balanced and diversified business, which is driving the broad-based performance and double-digit ACV growth at constant currency that we expect to see in 2022. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.040 billion to $2.110 billion, which is growth of 5.6% to 9.2% or 7.4% to 11.1% in constant currency. Let me touch on some of the assumptions considered in our full year guidance. We continue to expect broad-based growth and continued momentum from our large enterprise customers and SMB customers. We also assume that going forward we have a more normalized mix of business with our subscription lease licenses growing faster than perpetual licenses. As a result, ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue as the business model shifts to subscription lease licenses continues. Additionally, our full year guidance is based on how we see our book of business and pipeline today. As a result, we have assumed a neutral inflationary impact to our top line. However we have assumed a moderate impact from inflation on expenses. This brings me to our operating margin guidance. We expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. As a result we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.64 to $8.10. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 18%, which is one point lower than the 19% rate we had in 2021 due to recurring tax savings expected from tax planning initiatives. Now, let me turn to our full-year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $580 million to $620 million. We expect to see significant growth in operating cash flow levels year-over-year driven by strong operating leverage in our business model. However, our cash guidance absorbs the negative impact of approximately $60 million to $80 million in additional cash income taxes. This is driven by RNE capitalization tax legislation and other law changes that impact tax years starting January 1st, 2022. Although our overall 2022 tax rate is expected to be lower. The effect of the law changes the timing of cash tax payments, which creates near-term cash flow headwinds that will normalize through the amortization dynamics that occur over time. While there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers the requirement to capitalize RNE, we are including higher cash taxes in our current outlook, as we will be required to make these payments unless the existing law is amended. This legislation impacts timing of cash flow. It has no impact on our ability to operationally grow cash flow and does not create any incremental expense obligation. We remain optimistic about our cash generation in both the short and the long term. As you can calculate from our guidance, our current outlook absorbing the timing impact expects operating cash flows to grow faster than ACV in 2022. Additionally, since quarterly operating cash flow can be volatile, growth in our full-year cash outlook continues to be the best measure of success. We have seen significant currency volatility so far in 2022. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $34 million and on operating cash flow by approximately $12 million. Further details around specific currency rates, changes in tax legislation and other receipts, changes in tax legislation and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q1 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Now turning to guidance for the first quarter. This year we will provide quarterly ACV guidance to help with your modeling. As a reminder annual ACV is the best metric to observe the momentum in our business. We expect first quarter ACV in the range of $328 million to $348 million, revenue in the range of $395 million to $420 million, operating margin in the range of 29.1% to 31.9% and EPS in the range of a $1.05 to $1.22. Heading into 2022, we have a strong pipeline, diversified business model and a high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for another outstanding quarter topping off a fantastic year. Despite a continued challenging macro environment, we delivered broad-based growth. The team's exceptional operational discipline and customer centricity enables us to meet or exceed our internal models across every geography and customer segment and deliver extraordinary value to our customers across the globe. We continue to build on that momentum, invest in our business, while executing against our strategic priorities and we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Sure. Thanks John. Yes. So I'll answer your second question first and then the first question. So yes, if there was legislation that delayed or repeal the law that $60 million to $80 million would be added back to the cash flow outlook. Now that is that is pending. Any changes in tax law that could occur as a result of that repeal. So if it was just a straight repeal of that or delay of that then that would be the right interpretation. From an SG&A standpoint, I think the way to think about it is that it would be fairly consistent from an [Indiscernible] standpoint overall. Do we lose you? Okay. Thanks so much John. Yes. And so, Jay, to your question on the deferred revenue and backlog balance. Yes, you're correct. We closed the quarter with deferred revenue and backlog were about a 1.3 billion and that grew about 30% year-over-year. Now the strong growth came from the great momentum we've been seeing in our business and the success of the sales strategy to shift the business model to multi-year subscription leases. So to the point that you made earlier about strong multi-year performance. Now Q4 was especially strong because of the timing of some of the start dates of contracts executed in Q4. And since some -- since these contracts were signed before Q4 ended these contractual obligations are included in the deferred revenue backlog balance at the end of the year. But if you normalized for some of these contractual commitments which had later start dates, the growth would still be really strong. It would be close to the mid-teens. And so, I would say that overall really strong performance. Yes. So thanks Adam. We saw strong growth [Indiscernible]. So as you can calculate some prior guidance on the impact of DGI and that the same actually investigated before. In 2021, we had really stronger growth [ph]. Yes. That is definitely implicit in our guidance is that, as you recall in 2020 there was a more -- there was more of a trough around perpetual 2021 reflected I'd say kind of getting back to the normal level of perpetual we had. So our underlying view is that the momentum of customers is moving towards time-based licensing and that will continue over time as the business model has shifted pretty substantially towards that over the past five years. And so, our underlying assumption in 2022 is that the mix is a little bit more normalized. And as a result, ACV is growing faster than revenue as a result of that mixed compare dynamic. Yes. I mean, I would say, fundamentally 2021 was a really strong year. And I'd say, if you compare to where we were at the beginning of last year, we had just come off of a really significant compare dynamic around Q4 2020, right? But the underlying momentum of the business as you could see through the full year of beat and raise, definitely exceeded our expectations as we exited 2021. So going into 2022, our expectation is that guidance will -- or that performance will continue to be broad-based, it was broad-based across customer sets, geographies, industries, I mean it was pretty consistent. And so, I would say that that's the primary factor in the underlying confidence around what we consider to be a pretty strong expectation of double-digit growth of 10% at the midpoint in ACV. Sure. So, let me just start by saying, and I think I've mentioned this a couple time is that, we're committed to industry leading margins and the ANSYS business model is highly efficient. We have substantial operating leverage and low variable costs. Now, in our 2022 published guidance, you can see that operating leverage in the business model, When the guidance projects ACV to be stronger than revenue growth and cash flow to grow faster than ACV. And that cash flow growth is after absorbing the impact of R&E capitalization, right? Now, in terms of operating margin specifically, revenue growth headwinds from expected license mix really is the primary driver of those operating margin headwinds. And that dynamic is more about accounting in the P&L than operating leverage. The operating leverage really can be seen in those underlying dynamics between ACV and cash flow. Now, in addition, I mentioned in the prepared remarks in both cash flow and operating margin, we do have assumptions of a moderate impact of inflation on expenses. And so that is a bit of a headwind to both. But I would say primarily it's the underlying dynamic around just accounting and where revenue is this year relative to ACV. Sure. Ye, I apologize. I had some technical difficulties earlier, so apologize for those who couldn't hear my answer. Yes. So, for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021, our ACV growth in constant currency was 16%. And when you back out the $86 million to $88 million associated with the combination of AGI and Zemax, You can see that's really strong organic growth both in the quarter and for the full year. Now, as we move into 2022, we're really pleased with ACV guidance of approximately 10% at constant currency at the midpoint. And again, on that business model of double digit growth including tuck-in M&A. And within 2022, we still expect Zemax to have an inorganic impact of about $20 million. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. I mean, I would say, as we go -- as we exited, went throughout 2021 and going into 2022, we saw more of a return to a more normalized collection environments past new environments. And so, the underlying momentum of the business and collections is quite strong. And in addition to that in the 2022 guidance, as I had mentioned in my earlier answer, there's significant operating leverage in the business overall around ACV. So although, operating margins overall are relatively flat, but on an -- when you compare the cash flow generation against ACV, because ACV is growing faster than revenue, you really see strong operating leverage. So it's a combination of the underlying momentum of kind of getting back to more normalized collection patterns and the underlying operating leverage in the business that has really driven the strength of the performance going into 2022. Yes. No. I mean, obviously, the strength of the cash generation of the business and the balance sheet are great assets. And over the years the greatest return we've been able to provide to shareholders is the deployment of access cash using it to acquire premier simulation technologies to fill out the portfolio, to complete what's already the broadest and the deepest portfolio. And last year, some -- sometimes there's just not the right timing or there's nothing imminent to deploy that cash against, so we're not -- there's not something that's going to deliver the right return for shareholders and so in those times we do repurchase shares. Last year we repurchased about 347,000 shares for about $135 million. And so, we would expect to continue to think along those lines of how we think about capital allocation overall."

I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. With strong ACV growth in the quarter, I\u2019m delighted that year to date, we\u2019re on our stated goal of double-digit ACV growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our accomplishments thus far in 2021 are further evidence of the success of our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle, our multiphysics product leadership, and our strong customer relationships. Those factors, combined with customers\u2019 continued investment in R&D initiatives are driving demand for ANSYS\u2019 multiphysics solutions. With a robust deal pipeline and momentum in the business bolstering our confidence, we are raising our full-year financial guidance above and beyond the impact of our strong Q3 top-line performance. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. From vertical and geographical perspectives, our Q3 results came in as expected. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace & defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. Looking at our major geographies, the Americas again led the way, followed by Asia Pacific. We expect each region to have its largest quarter in Q4, with the quarterly skew to be more pronounced in Q4 for Europe. One of Q3\u2019s highlights was a 3-year $58 million agreement with a North American high-tech customer. From an ACV perspective, this deal was the second largest multiyear contract in our history. This customer was already using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio and is now expanding its number of simulation users. It is using ANSYS for diverse applications, ranging from ensuring the reliability of radio frequency systems to meeting sustainability goals across its product line and to chip-package-system analysis for power and signal integrity. Another key deal in Q3 was a multiyear agreement with Seagate technology, a leader in mass data storage solutions. Seagate is a longtime ANSYS customer, and this new contract broadens the company\u2019s use of multiphysics simulation, to address next generation product challenges faced by its global customer base. For example, Seagate is using ANSYS multiphysics products to assess thermal effects and acoustics to create a seamless workflow to enable higher capacity hard drives and to streamline process integration for heat-assisted magnetic recording. The company also now has access to our optical suite of products to drive further innovations. As we have discussed, our small and medium-sized customers, or SMBs, were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. However, during the last few quarters, we are seeing a recovery. And SMB customers have increased their investment in ANSYS simulation. Our ongoing increase in sales from our SMB customers gives me further confidence as we plan for Q4 and beyond. During these calls, I typically give you some insights into various aspects of the ANSYS business. In the past, I have discussed our best-in-class electromagnetic solutions, our unparalleled product scalability and the extreme accuracy of our structural solutions. As you heard me discuss with Seagate, optical simulation is becoming increasingly important for our customer base. In fact, in Q3, about 5% of our agreements included an optical simulation product in the order. Given that, as well as our recent closing of the Zemax acquisition, I would like to spend some time today, discussing our offerings for optical simulation. Three years ago, ANSYS did not have any optical simulation products in our portfolio. Today though, companies can rely on ANSYS for an end-to-end solution, spanning the gamut from photons to electrons based on 3 product lines. The first, ANSYS Lumerical empowers users to design and analyze integrated photonic components and systems, and model challenging product problems including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. The second product line, ANSYS SPEOS simulates the system\u2019s optical performance and evaluates the final illumination effect by enabling high-fidelity visualization based on human vision and camera-sensing capabilities. Third is our recent acquisition of Zemax, which enables customers to accurately model the behavior of lights through complex optical lens systems. Instead of working independently as a siloed offering, our optical simulation suite operates as part of a complete multi-physics workflow. Taken together, the ANSYS optical solution is used for a diverse set of applications ranging from camera and lidar arrays found in autonomous vehicles, to telecommunications and mobile phone cameras, to medical equipment and other visual aids. For example, in Q3, Sandia National Lab signed an agreement leading to expanded use of Lumerical technologies. Sandia develops leading-edge integrated photonic and nano-photonic solutions for quantum computing, imaging and sensing. The lab uses Lumerical tools to design model and simulate custom photonic components and behavior in a circuit environment. In the automotive sector, industry leader, Ford, uses ANSYS products including SPEOS, and the ANSYS vehicle headlight solution in the styling and design of its predictive smart headlamps, and to optimize and validate headlight performance. Our headlight solution features real time physics-based optical simulation and driver in the loop functionality to replicate the physical world with a high degree of predictive accuracy. Automotive giant Mazda is also increasing its use of SPEOS for internal and exterior lighting, head up displays and cameras, thanks to a sales agreement in Q3. In aerospace and defense, an ANSYS customers using all 3 of our optical product lines across multiple applications, the customer relies on Lumerical for creating photonics integrated circuits, it uses SPEOS for detecting radiation leaks from aircraft enclosures, and this customer is also using Zemax to study lens deformation. While still new to our portfolio and a relatively small contributor to our overall financial results, these optical solutions fit squarely into our go-to-market motion, and our sales team understands how to market these products. Based on the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation, our optical customers can easily access products across our portfolio to perform true multi-physics analysis. We saw an excellent example of that with another aerospace and defense customer that was challenged with a wing camera that was capturing blurry images. By using a combination of ANSYS optical and ANSYS fluids products, the customer was able to correct the problem and deliver crisp images even at extreme speeds in bad weather. Moving to our partners, I\u2019m excited that we are expanding our relationship with Autodesk by embedding ANSYS\u2019 electromagnetic simulation capabilities to explore and validate printed circuit board designs within the Fusion 360 workflow. This first of a kind Autodesk Fusion 360 extension will enable CAD users to perform near real time PCB analysis and retrieve real time insights into their electromagnetic performance to accelerate the development of next generation products. We have also expanded connectivity of ANSYS Twin Builder to industrial control systems through Rockwell Automation enhanced Studio 5000 Simulation Interface. Users can connect digital twins to emulator controllers to optimize production at the design stage, or physical controllers to enhance equipment performance in real time, for example, in predictive maintenance. I am pleased that we have expanded our partnership with TSMC to create a comprehensive thermal analysis solution for multi-dye semiconductor designs using ANSYS RedHawk-SC Electrothermal and ANSYS Icepak. Along with TSMC\u2019s silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies, users can analyze complete chip and package systems with high fidelity results. We are also collaborating with Fujitsu to enable more sustainable product development for our customers. ANSYS LS-DYNA now supports Fujitsu\u2019s energy efficient prime HPC supercomputers, which will help customers reduce energy consumption and costs by offloading simulation workloads to a more energy efficient machine. Keeping with our environmental, social and governance initiatives for a moment, we recently published our simulation products handprint for autonomous vehicles. This report illustrates the role that simulation plays in the development of autonomous vehicles, including in sensors, automated driving software, and safety testing. Using simulation to develop autonomous vehicles will lead to significant societal and environmental benefits, ranging from a drop in traffic fatalities to a reduction in emissions. We have also submitted our initial report with the climate disclosure project and expect results by the end of the year. Similarly, we have begun working on our reports to the task force on climate related financial disclosures, which focuses on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. In summary, Q3 was another remarkable quarter for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all key financial metrics, and have met our goal of delivering double-digit growth year-to-date. We\u2019re also expanding our product leadership in our core solutions as well as an important emerging area such as optical simulation. These factors combined with a strong Q4 sales pipeline and outstanding execution give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and 2021. The third quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter. ACV was strong and in line with our expectations, while revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high-end of our Q3 guidance driven by the mix of license types sold in the quarter, both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well, and our growth during the quarter with broad-based. Now, let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $365.4 million, and grew year-over-year 20% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 76% of the total. Q3 total revenue was $445.4 million and grew 21% or 20% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded the high-end of our guidance driven by license mix. Q3 revenue growth was also wide ranging across tough customer types and industries. For the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had strong top-line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double-digit at 17% and 19%, respectively. As Ajei mentioned, for both Q3 and Q3 year-to-date, we are executing against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $899.5 million. During the quarter, we continue to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 89.9% and an operating margin of 39.7%, which was better than our Q3 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance from license mix, as well as the timing of investments. The results with third quarter EPS of $1.59, which was also above the high-end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results from license mix and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q3 totaled $157.8 million, which benefited from strong collections, primarily driven by robust Q2 growth, favorable timing of intra-quarter sales, and a reduction in the percent of receivables past due. We ended the quarter with $1,081.4 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 97,000 shares during the quarter for around $36 million. We have 2.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, on October 1, we acquired Zemax for a purchase price of $399.1 million net of cash acquired. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year given the improved sales pipeline we see in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are initiating guidance for Q4 and increasing our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This raise reflects the strong financial performance in the third quarter and the increased momentum of our sales pipeline going into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $614.9 million to $654.9 million, operating margin in the range of 44.5% to 47%, and EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.81. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full-year ACV Outlook to be in the range of $1,825 million to $1,860 million. This represents growth of 12.9% to 15.1% or 12.6% to 14.7% in constant currency. Our Q4 and full year 2021 guidance is based on continued momentum in the business and a Q4 pipeline that has accelerated since our August guidance. It does not include a repeat of the outside spending behavior we saw in December 2020 after vaccines were announced. The raise also incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million of contribution from Zemax in Q4, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $20 million, which translates to an increase of 1.5 points of constant currency growth compared to our August guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1,885 million to $1,925 million, which is growth of 11.2% to 13.5% or 10.6% to 12.9% in constant currency. This raise reflects our strong Q3 revenue performance driven by license mix, as well as the incremental organic revenue from the momentum of our Q4 pipeline. Like ACV, our increased revenue incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million contribution from Zemax, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwinds. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $40 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 3 points higher, than the midpoint of our August guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full-year basis, revenue growth is less volatile. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect the revenue growth rate to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of license types sold in the fourth quarter 2020 versus our current 2021 fourth quarter pipeline. We are increasing our full-year operating margin and now expect operating margin to be in the range of 40.5% to 41.5%. Additionally, we are increasing our full-year EPS, and now expect EPS to be in the range of $7.05 to $7.38. This increase incorporates our Q3 performance and is offset by approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that move from Q3 to the fourth quarter of the year. Now, let me turn to our full-year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $505 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and is partially offset by approximately $3 million to $5 million of currency headwinds. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that has been factored into our Q4 and 2021 guidance are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2022 guidance once we finalize our 2022 planning process and close out 2021. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove our robust Q3 financial performance and continued momentum going into our last quarter of the year. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales pipeline, demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2021 outlook, as well as our longer-term financial objectives. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And, ladies and gentlemen, our first question today comes from John Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Oh, great. Hi, everyone. Just on the points of ANSYS growing in line with the targets, you provided back in 2019, how different is the composition of the growth today relative to the original budget? For instance, something like optical, not around to 2019, now 5% of bookings. Is it true to say there is maybe newer and faster growing contributors to ACV? And if that is true, does it suggest that there is also areas of the business that might be on the lagging end of recovery, and so you get bigger contributors in future years?\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah. So I\u2019ll take that. Thanks so much for your question, John. So, yes, as you can \u2013 as you point out, we are well within our model of double-digit growth. With tuck-in acquisitions on the year-to-date basis, our growth certainly puts us squarely on that model. What I would say is, there are 2 components to that. So the core itself, the core structures, fluids, those businesses are still solid contributors to growth and continue to grow. As you point out, we have been building the broadest, deepest simulation portfolio over multiple decades. And that has only accelerated in the past 5 years. And so, I think Ajei\u2019s talk about the optical business is an example of something that was maybe quite nascent, a couple of years ago, that is quite robust, competitive and extensive right now. And so, I would give that as an example. Ajei, do you want to comment anything for that?\nAjei Gopal: Yeah, so when we talked about in 2000, when we gave long-term guidance, if you look at the addressable market, we talked about the core, the foundations of the business. And then, we talked about a high growth adjacencies, including areas such as autonomy, electrification, IoT, 5G. And we talked about some of the investments that we were making. And in particular, we did talk about optical as an area that we were investing in, in particular, to support things like autonomous vehicles, as well as to support things like 5G for the purposes of interconnects, and so forth. And so, we\u2019ve essentially been executing against the strategy that we laid out. I\u2019ll also want to correct a point that you made in your question. You said 5% of the bookings came from optical. That\u2019s not what I said in my script. What I said is that 5% of the deals had some optical component within the within the agreement with the customer. So there was some aspect of optical within that. Optical, of course, is a relatively small piece of our business today.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay, thanks, Ajei, for the clarification. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Hey, guys, good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Just a question. If you look at the numbers, sort of a fairly significant outgrowth in the U.S., relative to the rest of the world. Could you just talk about how this COVID \u2013 A, what\u2019s driving it? I assume a lot of it is COVID driven. And how the reopening dynamic could sort of change those going into the yearend and into next year, i.e., what would it take for the rest of the world to catch up with the U.S.? And why is the U.S. so robust? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah. Thanks so much for your question, Andrew. So as you pointed out, over the last 12 months, America has continued to be a consistent strong performer, and lead the company in creating value for our customers. A couple of deals with the, one that Ajei mentioned in his remarks, the $58 million agreement with a leading North American technology company is an example of \u2013 I think the model that we have exported around the world and leaves some of the strength in our other regions like APAC, where the customer has already been using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio, but is now expanding the number of simulation users. And so, we\u2019ve done a very good job at building deep relationships with customers, understanding their short and their long-term development roadmaps, and enabling them to be able to propagate the use of simulation to broader use-cases, to connect to physics and to also connect to other users and in the process to leverage that simulation. And so, that model that America executes quite well, is the model that we\u2019re executing around the world. And just as an example, our Asia-Pacific region has executed exceptionally. They had another quarter, a very strong growth with 21%, constant currency growth \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 21% growth in the region at a constant currency basis. And the strength in that region was broad-based across industry, customer types, geographies. We had several 7 figure contracts in Asia Pacific, that added growth to the high-tech sector, where customers are really showing enthusiasm for not just the core portfolio, but the adjacencies as well. So there is a common theme here, where we\u2019re broadening and deepening the relationships within the customer, with our core technology, having strong footholds and solid growth, but also leveraging the organic and the inorganic investments that we\u2019ve been making over the past 5 years, to accelerate the footprint globally. And so, I would say the core strength of the portfolio and the investments that we\u2019ve been making, during the course of the pandemic, with our customers and in our portfolio are really the drivers of the acceleration and performance of growth. To some degree, there is a little bit of recovery. It\u2019s that Asia Pacific probably had a little bit ahead in the recovery versus America. There are still unevenness in terms of customers are preferring to meet in person. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize things as returned to normal quite yet. But certainly, the business model is resilient. It is showing through, regardless of the challenges that we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic.\nAndrew Obin: Oh, wow. Thank you. So it has much as sort of reopening as structural changes in the business model, is that the right way of reading it?\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the success that the management team is enjoying as a result of building out that robust portfolio in that business model. But I think, also the point around investing during the pandemic is, is important to note. I mean, it\u2019s really easy in a tough time to barrel down the hatches and not make investments in the business. That\u2019s kind of what people might expect. But there is a very proactive or very deliberate decision to not over-pivot in that direction, because of our confidence in the opportunity around what we do and the value that we can add to our customers. And so, I really do feel like we\u2019re going to be coming out of the pandemic, whenever that might be in a real position of strength.\nAjei Gopal: And I think, just to add one small point to Nicole\u2019s response there, when you think about the investments that customers make in ANSYS, it\u2019s really triggered by their investments in R&D. And obviously, globally, you\u2019re seeing investments in R&D, customers continuing to look at next generation products and offerings, and that\u2019s where simulation comes in. So the fact that we can help them with building their next generation, again, points to the importance of our technology. And that\u2019s what allows us to be in a position to make these relationships and sales during a pandemic, or any other time for that matter.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you. And just a follow-up question, I think on a previous call, you guys highlighted how small and medium business sort of tends to lead your core business. And you made some remarks about small and medium. You are continuing to see improvement. But can you just talk about sort of sequential trends in SMB? And what this portend \u2013 if you still view it as a leading indicator for the rest of the business go into the yearend and next year? And I know you did improve your 4Q outlook, but just maybe more color there. Thanks so much.\nNicole Anasenes: Sure, I\u2019ll start and if there\u2019s anything you have to add \u2013 you\u2019d like to add, Ajei. So, yes, as I mentioned in our opening remarks, we continue to see strength in the SMB customer-set in Q3. And we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that we\u2019ve seen now 4 quarters in a row. And so, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s given us the confidence in continuing to raise throughout the year, in addition to the fact that our pipeline with our large customers is solid, robust, and continues to evolve and improve. And so, I\u2019m not sure that the two are interrelated. I think that they\u2019re somewhat related in the broader sense of recovery. But I do feel like, although we\u2019re not quite at pre-pandemic behavior within the SMB set, we\u2019re really pleased with the ongoing momentum, and what we\u2019ve been delivering in that business.\nAjei Gopal: Yeah. And just to amplify one of the points Nicole made, the large customer dynamic is somewhat different from the SMB. For the most part, the large customer dynamic is driven by the long-term relationships that we\u2019ve maintained with our direct sales-force with these customers. Many of these are long-term customers of ours. They\u2019ve built their processes around ANSYS. And when it comes to a new project, or a new activity, as they start to continue to evolve their R&D efforts, they turn to us as a vendor. And so, there\u2019s an opportunity within those customers to expand the footprint based on long-term relationships. In the case of SMBs, in many cases, the SMBs are relationships that we have through channel partners. And, some of these customers may be relatively new customers. They may be relatively early in their life as an organization. And so, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say SMB is a leading indicator, which was the point that you made. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s a leading indicator. These are two different \u2013 there are slightly different dynamics across both the SMB and enterprise. And, each one of them has their own go-to-market motion and supporting activity.\nAndrew Obin: Fantastic. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nGal Munda: Yeah. Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just in terms of the raised ACV guidance that we\u2019re seeing, again, you did a second time in a row, kind of becoming material. I was just wondering what enabled you that. Is it this trend that you\u2019ve seen in SMB in Q3 or \u2013 and also, coupled with strength in Asia that you mentioned? Or is it just the outlook? As you look into Q4, you mentioned the pipeline looks really strong in terms of what\u2019s still to come in Q4 versus what you originally expected?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So, in Q3, we had a really strong Q3 as you point out with that strong double-digit growth. Q3 ACV did come in line really close within our expectations. And so, the raise on ACV in Q4 is really a function of the improved momentum that has been building since the last time we shared guidance in August, across the board. And so, what I would say is when you look at how we delivered year to date and in the quarter, it\u2019s been pretty broad-based across industries and customers. And, that\u2019s kind of the reflection of what I would characterize the momentum in Q4. There is not any isolated one-off thing that is driving that view. It is more kind of an overall momentum building that you\u2019ve been seeing, as you rightly point out, we\u2019ve been able to raise throughout the year, I mean, as you recall in the beginning of the year, we still were not sure whether what the kind of dynamics around recovery were going to look like. And so, we\u2019ve been kind of sharing with you as we see things ahead of us, and systematically raising expectations over time.\nGal Munda: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Nicole. And then just as a follow-up, maybe, Ajei to you. You mentioned Autodesk partnership that is expanding again, especially in terms of electromagnetic introducing PCB simulation within the Fusion 360 product. You\u2019ve also worked closely with PTC on the test side with both Discovery Live and ANSYS simulation. It\u2019s kind of a slightly different physics for each of the partners. Is there a possibility that you start introducing more of the traditional physics solvers into the Autodesk partnership and vice versa? Would you expand the PTC partnership with electromagnetic side as well?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I think, look at the end of the day, Gal, when you think about it, partnerships allow ANSYS to really expand our market reach by leveraging what our partners bring to the table. They\u2019ll bring complementary technology skills. They have a brand. They can help us reach different customer segments, so that more people can benefit from simulation. Partnering allows us to create a combined solution with a leading vendor. So at the end of the day, customers can benefit from a more complete solution than either one of us can provide on our own. Now, key to our partnerships and you\u2019ll see this all along, key to our partnerships is maintaining an open ecosystem. So we\u2019re not about \u2013 our partnerships are not about blocking things off, but are making things available, opening things up. And our strategy and our products remain open, so that customers can create the optimal system to meet their needs. So as you think about our partnership strategy, just think about that, we are open to trying to make sure that we can leverage and work with our partners to make our customers benefit from the entirety of what we can bring to bear, because we have an open strategy. I can\u2019t comment about specifically any individual partnership of the direction that it may go. But, hopefully have some perspective of how we think about partnerships.\nGal Munda: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Ajei.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Ajei, just a high-level question for you, I mean, clearly, you put up a couple really strong quarters here, and it sounds like the pipeline is really healthy into Q4. Just as we think about what\u2019s going on more broadly with supply chain constraints and, obviously, putting pressure on kind of physical testing requirements. How much of the strength do you think could be attributed to some of the supply chain and just macro challenges that the customers are going through? And, I guess, just curious if you feel like this period is further evangelizing or potentially accelerating the need for simulation. In other words, do you feel like this is kind of a new sustainable growth rate going forward? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Well, so let me address your question in 2 sort of timeframe, one is you think about the short term. So in the short-term, supply chain disruptions may be affecting many businesses, but we\u2019re really not one of the businesses that\u2019s affected by the supply chain. And the reason is, as I mentioned earlier, the use of our software is tied to the design of products, is tied to the R&D phase for the most part, and it\u2019s not denominated by manufacturing. So whether if a customer has challenges with the supply chain, and they can\u2019t produce as many units of a particular product that\u2019s been designed with our technology that doesn\u2019t affect our relationship with the customer, they\u2019re already designing what that next product looks like, and they\u2019re working with our engineers, or they\u2019re working with our technology to figure out what the future looks like. So our customers continue to make investments during \u2013 in R&D, and it\u2019s really not affected by the supply chain in the short-term, so we have no real short-term issues there. When you think about it from a long-term perspective, I think, you\u2019re also alluding to this in your question. When you think about the long-term perspective, companies, I think, around the globe are questioning exactly how they need to think about their supply chains going forward. So will they be a change in the way they\u2019ve been thinking about the supply chains, and in some cases, you\u2019re seeing customer thinking about moving manufacturing closer to where the final product is actually going to be used. This isn\u2019t necessarily building factories in the more traditional way. In many cases, customers are thinking about building next generation factories where they have much more automation, robotics, next generation manufacturing techniques, all of these things are relevant for simulation. We\u2019re in a position \u2013 we had ANSYS there in a position to help our customers as they go through this rethinking process, as they go through the design of these next generation capabilities, as they start to think about advanced manufacturing techniques, materials, as they work through the simulation that goes with that we\u2019re in a position to help them. And so, we see this as a long-term tailwind, where we can help customers as they try to figure out what this next generation looks like in their own evolution.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. First question, Ajei, at the company\u2019s IDEAS conference last month hosted by your semiconductor business unit, there were 2 very interesting comments from management regarding the strategic vision that ANSYS has. There was a reference to your becoming a quote cloud first digital platform as a foundation for your future growth that\u2019s quote from the presentation. Similarly, that you foresee a time of simulation platforms and insights as a service again it\u2019s a direct quote. So, and thinking about your cloud future, was the commentary your conference mentor suggests that cloud is not just an adjunct or complement to what you\u2019re doing today in terms of delivering technology, but ultimately becomes the Nexus of how you deliver technology, perhaps, not unlike what PTC discussed for itself on their call last night? And then as a follow-up question, in light of the improving disability in terms of pipeline and the like, can you talk about the investments you\u2019re making or planning to make in technical support and consulting? That\u2019s typically you\u2019re certainly lately, your second highest number of open positions after R&D, and you look like you\u2019re ramping up in that area. So maybe talk about those investments and the availability of the necessary personnel for that function.\nAjei Gopal: Sure, Jay, so let me try to unpack your question. And let me start with the longer-term direction comment that you asked. And, I think, look you\u2019ll hear a lot more about strategic direction for where we\u2019re going over the next year, and so on, think of some of the comments that you heard as [dembrading] [ph] some of the super exciting times that [our hit branches] [ph] and our customers. You talked a little bit about Cloud, we\u2019ve got ANSYS Cloud out there, which manages access to high performance computing resources, it\u2019s just remember that many of our customers for them Cloud is about being able to access high performance computing at scale, and enabling some of these larger high fidelity simulations to run a scale. And so, in this last quarter on this call, I talked about the scalability of some of our product products that was enabled by a customer for us at the Technical University of Eindhoven, where they solved a an aerodynamic problem with something like 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. And that scalability is possible, of course, because of core technical advancements that we\u2019ve done. So, for example, we sped up mesh generation by 20X, which is obviously a bottleneck in the creation of detailed simulation of transient phenomena. But also, we were in a position to give access to cloud computing resources. And, in fact, just this week, Satya Nadella in his keynote at Microsoft Ignite use the same example to show what is possible on the ANSYS Cloud platform, which is essentially ANSYS\u2019 products running on Azure on the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer. So that was one example, I think of Cloud that I\u2019m excited about. We support flexible licensing models, we support an elastic pay-as-you-go model, we support a hybrid model, which mixes and matches elastic as well as lease licenses. And this year, we\u2019ve continued to expand the number of products that we\u2019ve added into cloud capabilities. For example, we\u2019ve added an LS-DYNA, we\u2019ve added in Lumerical products, we\u2019ve added in SOC2 certification, we continue to improve our overall customer experience. And we\u2019ve also seen significant increases in cloud usage. So one of the ways that we monitor that, of course, is by looking at core hours. And this year, year-to-date, we\u2019re seeing almost 4 times as many for core hours as compared to this time last year. And we still haven\u2019t hit that inflection point. So we believe that there is still much greater demand within our customer base. And we\u2019re watching our customers, we\u2019re seeing where they\u2019re going, we\u2019re anticipating where they\u2019re going, and we\u2019re giving them the opportunity to be able to drive some of the scale out compute. So I\u2019m really excited about where we are with cloud and some of that capability. There was a number of other things, I\u2019m sure, that were also mentioned in that conversation, some of the things that we\u2019re excited about the new capabilities we have in our product. We\u2019ve talked about AIML, and how AIML supports our technology and simulation. All of those are interrelated, because the advances that we make in one area can be delivered to our customers in other ways, and that allows us to be a more responsive vendor to our customers or partner to our customers that allows us to continue to drive leadership in the marketplace. So that was the first question. What was the second question, Jay? It was around\u2026\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yeah, it was around the investments in technical consulting and support positions, which as I noted, is typically your second largest number of open positions after R&D?\nAjei Gopal: Yeah, so I think if the question is, are we continuing to make investments in that area, that\u2019s absolutely the case. We do continue to make investments in the area, we think our relationship that we have with customers at a technical level is something that our customer\u2019s value, it gives us insight into the way we work with our customers use our technology, and it\u2019s a 2-way street, we\u2019re in a position to help our customers as they evolve. And, certainly, we\u2019re in a position to take customer feedback and insight into the next generation of our products coming in from the field. So, I think, we\u2019re excited and we continue to make investments in those areas.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. Thanks, Ajei.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJason Celino: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Related to Zemax, I\u2019d be curious on how that acquisition came together? I know in the past, you said that sometimes customers make requests. And I was wondering if this was one of those instances, and then maybe a quick follow-up, Zemax contribution on an annual basis? Is it fair to think its $24 million to $26 million of it is annualized the contribution for Q4? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah, so I can quickly answer that question on the contribution. So we expect \u2013 so we had \u2013 as we\u2019ve said, we think it\u2019ll have about $6 million to $8 million of ACV impact and revenue impact. This year, which will be offset by \u2013 largely offset by currency. Next year, we\u2019re estimating an incremental approximately $20 million in organic impact.\nAjei Gopal: And as far as how the acquisition comes together, as I\u2019ve said many times, acquisitions are not a strategy on to themselves; acquisitions are in support of a strategy. And clearly one of the areas that we have continued to drive is the broadening of our multi-physics capability. As I mentioned in the call, we have some leading optical simulation products and capabilities, but Zemax obviously, has been on our radar for a while as an opportunity for us to be able to broaden and deepen our portfolio in that space. And, I think in the script, you heard me talk about customers who are using all of the products and how the technologies could work together to support their R&D efforts. And so, this kind of technology fits right into our go-to-market motion. Our salespeople are very familiar with being able to position technology of this nature. So it\u2019s a very natural acquisition for us to conclude. We\u2019re excited about the technology. We\u2019re excited about bringing those people on board.\nJason Celino: Great. Excellent. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ken Wong of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Ajei, I wanted to touch on an announcement you guys made last month, the ANSYS and Apple, RF safety testing simulation module for MagSafe. Apple obviously has a very large partner ecosystem should we expect that this brings in a wave of new potential customers? Or is it simply additive to your existing tech relationships?\nAjei Gopal: So I can\u2019t talk about what any specific company may or may not do. But what I can tell you is that, we\u2019re really excited that we can make our technology available to customers who are not necessarily experts in using simulation. Our strategy for simulation is to take simulation and make it more pervasive across the product lifecycle. And part of that is creating applications that are easier for non-engineers to use. And so as part of our strategy, we\u2019re creating applications that include various elements of our technology that can be integrated together to deliver a SaaS experience for our end users, wherein they can simply invoke our technology under the covers if you will to solve specific problems. So those are the kinds of applications that we are excited also about bringing to market. And those are not \u2013 that\u2019s typically not an area that we\u2019ve historically participated in. But we certainly see that as being part of the overall strategy that we\u2019re driving of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle.\nKen Wong: Got it. Really appreciate the color there. And, Nicole, just wanted to touch on the higher mix of perpetual, is that simply a snapback to suppress perpetual buying from 2020? Or is there some other element causing that that higher perpetual mix?\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah, no, I would characterize it, as you recall perpetual licenses during the pandemic did take a quite a significant hit, particularly in the first 3 quarters of last year. And so they did recover quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year, which is one of the reasons why the compares a little more challenging in Q4. But customers continue to prefer time based licensing models, because it really enables them to be more flexible as their needs evolve. And so over the past several years, the business model has really been shifting away from perpetual licenses. If you look over longer periods of time, it\u2019s been pretty flat. And the growth has been primarily through the acceleration of leases. And so that\u2019s really built a very strong annuity business for us over the past 5 years, and has been a very successful evolution of the business. And so, while we did see \u2013 we are seeing kind of some of the compare effects in the first 3 quarters of this year, we believe over the long-term that the shift that customer \u2013 we\u2019re seeing from customers is going to continue towards that lease-based licensing.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you very much.\nNicole Anasenes: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Blair Abernethy of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nBlair Abernethy: Thanks. Nice quarter, everyone. Just following on Jay\u2019s question around the cloud. Ajei, I was just wondering if you can maybe help us understand where the customer interest lies right now, in terms of cloud-based simulation tools, so not just HPC, which has been in use for a long time. But, our customers looking to shift from on-prem to cloud with our tools, and if they are sort of \u2013 where are you seeing the traction out there.\nAjei Gopal: So, we\u2019re certainly seeing customers wanting to take more advantage of the cloud during the \u2013 certainly that happened during the pandemic, when people were working remotely and didn\u2019t have access as easy access to their offices. And that certainly drove some cloud usage, I mean, the fact remains that we can give our customers, who want to take advantage of our technology, we can give our customers an experience where they have elastic compute driven from the cloud, it\u2019s a fast like experience, we can give them that using our elastic licensing capabilities. So that that feels to them like a SaaS experience, and similarly, we can give our customers access to on premises technology in a lease model, which they\u2019ve used for a while. So we give our customers a choice of what they want to be in a position to do. ANSYS Cloud gives them that ability to support they need for cloud compute, both from the server perspective as well as scale up for HPC. So it really is up to the customers. And, many of our customers have made investments that are within their own to building out data centers, so they prefer to take advantage of their own data centers, some customers will look at the amount of data that they have to manage. I mean, when you think about a simulation, a complex multivariate simulation that\u2019s running across our multivariate optimization could result in terabytes of information. And so then there\u2019s a question of where do you store that information? How do you keep it? Do you move it from one cloud to another? What is their standard model? So it\u2019s not simply a matter of moving piece parts into the cloud. It\u2019s really thinking holistically from the part of the customers on where and how they want to make this transition, because it\u2019s an entire workflow that\u2019s across multiple vendors that needs to be managed. And I think we\u2019re very well positioned. Our technology is ready for the cloud. We\u2019re very well positioned. We\u2019re excited about our capabilities. And it really is a matter of meeting the customers as and when they\u2019re ready.\nBlair Abernethy: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jackson Ader with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Actually just, if we can follow up on, I mean, I know there has been a lot of questions on the cloud. But if we think about, if there are more deals that shift to either the ANSYS cloud or maybe through your partnership with Microsoft, how would that actually impact the revenue line items? And is there any kind of a difference in recognition, depending on where the cloud deployment is?\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah, I mean, I would say that the part of the business that customers are using on the cloud itself is very small and immaterial. The vast majority of the use-case is around seamless access to HPC capacity and other capacity outside the cloud, which has no impact on our current \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the same revenue recognition model that we have in the \u2013 whether it\u2019s a lease or perpetual license, because their entitlements would be separate from that usage.\nAjei Gopal: And the way we built our product, Jackson, is that customers can bring their own licenses, right? So it turns, you can seamlessly take advantage of both ANSYS cloud compute capabilities as well as you can take advantage of the same license running on premises. And so, the fact that we give you the flexibility of managing that, that\u2019s what customers are looking for. And so, we\u2019re not asking them to give up their investments in their on-prem compute. If they\u2019ve got that, that\u2019s great. They can take advantage of that. In addition, they can take advantage of cloud. Or if they want to choose to completely take advantage of the cloud, they can do that too. So that flexibility is what customers are looking for, and we\u2019re in a position to support them with that.\nJackson Ader: Okay, that makes sense. And then, a follow-up on DYNA. So the use-cases that we\u2019re kind of talking about here are different and are expanded from what we probably would have thought when you first acquired LS-DYNA, right down the middle, crash and impact. Is the malleability of the DYNA solver specific to DYNA or is this also something that like other solver portfolios can do, they can kind of be flexible outside of their core use-case?\nAjei Gopal: Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by the malleability. I think that, firstly, DYNA provided an explicit analysis capability into the portfolio, which obviously has use-cases, of wide variety of use-cases. And we\u2019ve continued to expand those use-cases within the ANSYS portfolio as we\u2019ve integrated the technologies together, and combine both explicit and implicit capabilities. It broadens the addressable opportunity. So that\u2019s obviously the case. I think perhaps you might be referring to the announcements we \u2013 the comment I made about Fujitsu. And I think in that, what is important to recognize is that the DYNA solver is available on the Fujitsu machine, on their PRIMEHPC supercomputer. And essentially because that machine is efficient, we can help our customers, because they\u2019re supporting DYNA on the \u2013 they\u2019re supporting their large-scale DYNA runs on the Fujitsu hardware platform. And that\u2019s more efficient, because they can offload some of their simulation workload onto to an efficient compute platform. So that was the point on that piece, and hopefully, that clarifies the comment about Fujitsu.\nJackson Ader: Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Ajei, for some closing comments.\nAjei Gopal: Thanks, Kelsey. So, I\u2019m really excited about our excellent execution, our broad customer base and our robust pipeline. Our customers\u2019 reliance in simulation, the strengthening of the small and medium business market, and our ability to close large contracts only add to that excitement and give me further confidence as we look to close out 2021. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their continued support. And a special thank you to my ANSYS colleagues. You have my gratitude for delivering yet another strong quarter. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. With strong ACV growth in the quarter, I\u2019m delighted that year to date, we\u2019re on our stated goal of double-digit ACV growth with tuck-in acquisitions. Our accomplishments thus far in 2021 are further evidence of the success of our strategy of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle, our multiphysics product leadership, and our strong customer relationships. Those factors, combined with customers\u2019 continued investment in R&D initiatives are driving demand for ANSYS\u2019 multiphysics solutions. With a robust deal pipeline and momentum in the business bolstering our confidence, we are raising our full-year financial guidance above and beyond the impact of our strong Q3 top-line performance. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. From vertical and geographical perspectives, our Q3 results came in as expected. The high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace & defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. Looking at our major geographies, the Americas again led the way, followed by Asia Pacific. We expect each region to have its largest quarter in Q4, with the quarterly skew to be more pronounced in Q4 for Europe. One of Q3\u2019s highlights was a 3-year $58 million agreement with a North American high-tech customer. From an ACV perspective, this deal was the second largest multiyear contract in our history. This customer was already using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio and is now expanding its number of simulation users. It is using ANSYS for diverse applications, ranging from ensuring the reliability of radio frequency systems to meeting sustainability goals across its product line and to chip-package-system analysis for power and signal integrity. Another key deal in Q3 was a multiyear agreement with Seagate technology, a leader in mass data storage solutions. Seagate is a longtime ANSYS customer, and this new contract broadens the company\u2019s use of multiphysics simulation, to address next generation product challenges faced by its global customer base. For example, Seagate is using ANSYS multiphysics products to assess thermal effects and acoustics to create a seamless workflow to enable higher capacity hard drives and to streamline process integration for heat-assisted magnetic recording. The company also now has access to our optical suite of products to drive further innovations. As we have discussed, our small and medium-sized customers, or SMBs, were disproportionately affected by the pandemic. However, during the last few quarters, we are seeing a recovery. And SMB customers have increased their investment in ANSYS simulation. Our ongoing increase in sales from our SMB customers gives me further confidence as we plan for Q4 and beyond. During these calls, I typically give you some insights into various aspects of the ANSYS business. In the past, I have discussed our best-in-class electromagnetic solutions, our unparalleled product scalability and the extreme accuracy of our structural solutions. As you heard me discuss with Seagate, optical simulation is becoming increasingly important for our customer base. In fact, in Q3, about 5% of our agreements included an optical simulation product in the order. Given that, as well as our recent closing of the Zemax acquisition, I would like to spend some time today, discussing our offerings for optical simulation. Three years ago, ANSYS did not have any optical simulation products in our portfolio. Today though, companies can rely on ANSYS for an end-to-end solution, spanning the gamut from photons to electrons based on 3 product lines. The first, ANSYS Lumerical empowers users to design and analyze integrated photonic components and systems, and model challenging product problems including interacting optical, electrical and thermal effects. The second product line, ANSYS SPEOS simulates the system\u2019s optical performance and evaluates the final illumination effect by enabling high-fidelity visualization based on human vision and camera-sensing capabilities. Third is our recent acquisition of Zemax, which enables customers to accurately model the behavior of lights through complex optical lens systems. Instead of working independently as a siloed offering, our optical simulation suite operates as part of a complete multi-physics workflow. Taken together, the ANSYS optical solution is used for a diverse set of applications ranging from camera and lidar arrays found in autonomous vehicles, to telecommunications and mobile phone cameras, to medical equipment and other visual aids. For example, in Q3, Sandia National Lab signed an agreement leading to expanded use of Lumerical technologies. Sandia develops leading-edge integrated photonic and nano-photonic solutions for quantum computing, imaging and sensing. The lab uses Lumerical tools to design model and simulate custom photonic components and behavior in a circuit environment. In the automotive sector, industry leader, Ford, uses ANSYS products including SPEOS, and the ANSYS vehicle headlight solution in the styling and design of its predictive smart headlamps, and to optimize and validate headlight performance. Our headlight solution features real time physics-based optical simulation and driver in the loop functionality to replicate the physical world with a high degree of predictive accuracy. Automotive giant Mazda is also increasing its use of SPEOS for internal and exterior lighting, head up displays and cameras, thanks to a sales agreement in Q3. In aerospace and defense, an ANSYS customers using all 3 of our optical product lines across multiple applications, the customer relies on Lumerical for creating photonics integrated circuits, it uses SPEOS for detecting radiation leaks from aircraft enclosures, and this customer is also using Zemax to study lens deformation. While still new to our portfolio and a relatively small contributor to our overall financial results, these optical solutions fit squarely into our go-to-market motion, and our sales team understands how to market these products. Based on the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation, our optical customers can easily access products across our portfolio to perform true multi-physics analysis. We saw an excellent example of that with another aerospace and defense customer that was challenged with a wing camera that was capturing blurry images. By using a combination of ANSYS optical and ANSYS fluids products, the customer was able to correct the problem and deliver crisp images even at extreme speeds in bad weather. Moving to our partners, I\u2019m excited that we are expanding our relationship with Autodesk by embedding ANSYS\u2019 electromagnetic simulation capabilities to explore and validate printed circuit board designs within the Fusion 360 workflow. This first of a kind Autodesk Fusion 360 extension will enable CAD users to perform near real time PCB analysis and retrieve real time insights into their electromagnetic performance to accelerate the development of next generation products. We have also expanded connectivity of ANSYS Twin Builder to industrial control systems through Rockwell Automation enhanced Studio 5000 Simulation Interface. Users can connect digital twins to emulator controllers to optimize production at the design stage, or physical controllers to enhance equipment performance in real time, for example, in predictive maintenance. I am pleased that we have expanded our partnership with TSMC to create a comprehensive thermal analysis solution for multi-dye semiconductor designs using ANSYS RedHawk-SC Electrothermal and ANSYS Icepak. Along with TSMC\u2019s silicon stacking and advanced packaging technologies, users can analyze complete chip and package systems with high fidelity results. We are also collaborating with Fujitsu to enable more sustainable product development for our customers. ANSYS LS-DYNA now supports Fujitsu\u2019s energy efficient prime HPC supercomputers, which will help customers reduce energy consumption and costs by offloading simulation workloads to a more energy efficient machine. Keeping with our environmental, social and governance initiatives for a moment, we recently published our simulation products handprint for autonomous vehicles. This report illustrates the role that simulation plays in the development of autonomous vehicles, including in sensors, automated driving software, and safety testing. Using simulation to develop autonomous vehicles will lead to significant societal and environmental benefits, ranging from a drop in traffic fatalities to a reduction in emissions. We have also submitted our initial report with the climate disclosure project and expect results by the end of the year. Similarly, we have begun working on our reports to the task force on climate related financial disclosures, which focuses on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. In summary, Q3 was another remarkable quarter for ANSYS. We beat guidance across all key financial metrics, and have met our goal of delivering double-digit growth year-to-date. We\u2019re also expanding our product leadership in our core solutions as well as an important emerging area such as optical simulation. These factors combined with a strong Q4 sales pipeline and outstanding execution give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Yeah, so when we talked about in 2000, when we gave long-term guidance, if you look at the addressable market, we talked about the core, the foundations of the business. And then, we talked about a high growth adjacencies, including areas such as autonomy, electrification, IoT, 5G. And we talked about some of the investments that we were making. And in particular, we did talk about optical as an area that we were investing in, in particular, to support things like autonomous vehicles, as well as to support things like 5G for the purposes of interconnects, and so forth. And so, we\u2019ve essentially been executing against the strategy that we laid out. I\u2019ll also want to correct a point that you made in your question. You said 5% of the bookings came from optical. That\u2019s not what I said in my script. What I said is that 5% of the deals had some optical component within the within the agreement with the customer. So there was some aspect of optical within that. Optical, of course, is a relatively small piece of our business today. Good morning. And I think, just to add one small point to Nicole\u2019s response there, when you think about the investments that customers make in ANSYS, it\u2019s really triggered by their investments in R&D. And obviously, globally, you\u2019re seeing investments in R&D, customers continuing to look at next generation products and offerings, and that\u2019s where simulation comes in. So the fact that we can help them with building their next generation, again, points to the importance of our technology. And that\u2019s what allows us to be in a position to make these relationships and sales during a pandemic, or any other time for that matter. Yeah. And just to amplify one of the points Nicole made, the large customer dynamic is somewhat different from the SMB. For the most part, the large customer dynamic is driven by the long-term relationships that we\u2019ve maintained with our direct sales-force with these customers. Many of these are long-term customers of ours. They\u2019ve built their processes around ANSYS. And when it comes to a new project, or a new activity, as they start to continue to evolve their R&D efforts, they turn to us as a vendor. And so, there\u2019s an opportunity within those customers to expand the footprint based on long-term relationships. In the case of SMBs, in many cases, the SMBs are relationships that we have through channel partners. And, some of these customers may be relatively new customers. They may be relatively early in their life as an organization. And so, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say SMB is a leading indicator, which was the point that you made. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s a leading indicator. These are two different \u2013 there are slightly different dynamics across both the SMB and enterprise. And, each one of them has their own go-to-market motion and supporting activity. Well, I think, look at the end of the day, Gal, when you think about it, partnerships allow ANSYS to really expand our market reach by leveraging what our partners bring to the table. They\u2019ll bring complementary technology skills. They have a brand. They can help us reach different customer segments, so that more people can benefit from simulation. Partnering allows us to create a combined solution with a leading vendor. So at the end of the day, customers can benefit from a more complete solution than either one of us can provide on our own. Now, key to our partnerships and you\u2019ll see this all along, key to our partnerships is maintaining an open ecosystem. So we\u2019re not about \u2013 our partnerships are not about blocking things off, but are making things available, opening things up. And our strategy and our products remain open, so that customers can create the optimal system to meet their needs. So as you think about our partnership strategy, just think about that, we are open to trying to make sure that we can leverage and work with our partners to make our customers benefit from the entirety of what we can bring to bear, because we have an open strategy. I can\u2019t comment about specifically any individual partnership of the direction that it may go. But, hopefully have some perspective of how we think about partnerships. Well, so let me address your question in 2 sort of timeframe, one is you think about the short term. So in the short-term, supply chain disruptions may be affecting many businesses, but we\u2019re really not one of the businesses that\u2019s affected by the supply chain. And the reason is, as I mentioned earlier, the use of our software is tied to the design of products, is tied to the R&D phase for the most part, and it\u2019s not denominated by manufacturing. So whether if a customer has challenges with the supply chain, and they can\u2019t produce as many units of a particular product that\u2019s been designed with our technology that doesn\u2019t affect our relationship with the customer, they\u2019re already designing what that next product looks like, and they\u2019re working with our engineers, or they\u2019re working with our technology to figure out what the future looks like. So our customers continue to make investments during \u2013 in R&D, and it\u2019s really not affected by the supply chain in the short-term, so we have no real short-term issues there. When you think about it from a long-term perspective, I think, you\u2019re also alluding to this in your question. When you think about the long-term perspective, companies, I think, around the globe are questioning exactly how they need to think about their supply chains going forward. So will they be a change in the way they\u2019ve been thinking about the supply chains, and in some cases, you\u2019re seeing customer thinking about moving manufacturing closer to where the final product is actually going to be used. This isn\u2019t necessarily building factories in the more traditional way. In many cases, customers are thinking about building next generation factories where they have much more automation, robotics, next generation manufacturing techniques, all of these things are relevant for simulation. We\u2019re in a position \u2013 we had ANSYS there in a position to help our customers as they go through this rethinking process, as they go through the design of these next generation capabilities, as they start to think about advanced manufacturing techniques, materials, as they work through the simulation that goes with that we\u2019re in a position to help them. And so, we see this as a long-term tailwind, where we can help customers as they try to figure out what this next generation looks like in their own evolution. Sure, Jay, so let me try to unpack your question. And let me start with the longer-term direction comment that you asked. And, I think, look you\u2019ll hear a lot more about strategic direction for where we\u2019re going over the next year, and so on, think of some of the comments that you heard as [dembrading] [ph] some of the super exciting times that [our hit branches] [ph] and our customers. You talked a little bit about Cloud, we\u2019ve got ANSYS Cloud out there, which manages access to high performance computing resources, it\u2019s just remember that many of our customers for them Cloud is about being able to access high performance computing at scale, and enabling some of these larger high fidelity simulations to run a scale. And so, in this last quarter on this call, I talked about the scalability of some of our product products that was enabled by a customer for us at the Technical University of Eindhoven, where they solved a an aerodynamic problem with something like 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. And that scalability is possible, of course, because of core technical advancements that we\u2019ve done. So, for example, we sped up mesh generation by 20X, which is obviously a bottleneck in the creation of detailed simulation of transient phenomena. But also, we were in a position to give access to cloud computing resources. And, in fact, just this week, Satya Nadella in his keynote at Microsoft Ignite use the same example to show what is possible on the ANSYS Cloud platform, which is essentially ANSYS\u2019 products running on Azure on the world\u2019s most powerful AI supercomputer. So that was one example, I think of Cloud that I\u2019m excited about. We support flexible licensing models, we support an elastic pay-as-you-go model, we support a hybrid model, which mixes and matches elastic as well as lease licenses. And this year, we\u2019ve continued to expand the number of products that we\u2019ve added into cloud capabilities. For example, we\u2019ve added an LS-DYNA, we\u2019ve added in Lumerical products, we\u2019ve added in SOC2 certification, we continue to improve our overall customer experience. And we\u2019ve also seen significant increases in cloud usage. So one of the ways that we monitor that, of course, is by looking at core hours. And this year, year-to-date, we\u2019re seeing almost 4 times as many for core hours as compared to this time last year. And we still haven\u2019t hit that inflection point. So we believe that there is still much greater demand within our customer base. And we\u2019re watching our customers, we\u2019re seeing where they\u2019re going, we\u2019re anticipating where they\u2019re going, and we\u2019re giving them the opportunity to be able to drive some of the scale out compute. So I\u2019m really excited about where we are with cloud and some of that capability. There was a number of other things, I\u2019m sure, that were also mentioned in that conversation, some of the things that we\u2019re excited about the new capabilities we have in our product. We\u2019ve talked about AIML, and how AIML supports our technology and simulation. All of those are interrelated, because the advances that we make in one area can be delivered to our customers in other ways, and that allows us to be a more responsive vendor to our customers or partner to our customers that allows us to continue to drive leadership in the marketplace. So that was the first question. What was the second question, Jay? It was around\u2026 Yeah, so I think if the question is, are we continuing to make investments in that area, that\u2019s absolutely the case. We do continue to make investments in the area, we think our relationship that we have with customers at a technical level is something that our customer\u2019s value, it gives us insight into the way we work with our customers use our technology, and it\u2019s a 2-way street, we\u2019re in a position to help our customers as they evolve. And, certainly, we\u2019re in a position to take customer feedback and insight into the next generation of our products coming in from the field. So, I think, we\u2019re excited and we continue to make investments in those areas. And as far as how the acquisition comes together, as I\u2019ve said many times, acquisitions are not a strategy on to themselves; acquisitions are in support of a strategy. And clearly one of the areas that we have continued to drive is the broadening of our multi-physics capability. As I mentioned in the call, we have some leading optical simulation products and capabilities, but Zemax obviously, has been on our radar for a while as an opportunity for us to be able to broaden and deepen our portfolio in that space. And, I think in the script, you heard me talk about customers who are using all of the products and how the technologies could work together to support their R&D efforts. And so, this kind of technology fits right into our go-to-market motion. Our salespeople are very familiar with being able to position technology of this nature. So it\u2019s a very natural acquisition for us to conclude. We\u2019re excited about the technology. We\u2019re excited about bringing those people on board. So I can\u2019t talk about what any specific company may or may not do. But what I can tell you is that, we\u2019re really excited that we can make our technology available to customers who are not necessarily experts in using simulation. Our strategy for simulation is to take simulation and make it more pervasive across the product lifecycle. And part of that is creating applications that are easier for non-engineers to use. And so as part of our strategy, we\u2019re creating applications that include various elements of our technology that can be integrated together to deliver a SaaS experience for our end users, wherein they can simply invoke our technology under the covers if you will to solve specific problems. So those are the kinds of applications that we are excited also about bringing to market. And those are not \u2013 that\u2019s typically not an area that we\u2019ve historically participated in. But we certainly see that as being part of the overall strategy that we\u2019re driving of making simulation pervasive across the product lifecycle. So, we\u2019re certainly seeing customers wanting to take more advantage of the cloud during the \u2013 certainly that happened during the pandemic, when people were working remotely and didn\u2019t have access as easy access to their offices. And that certainly drove some cloud usage, I mean, the fact remains that we can give our customers, who want to take advantage of our technology, we can give our customers an experience where they have elastic compute driven from the cloud, it\u2019s a fast like experience, we can give them that using our elastic licensing capabilities. So that that feels to them like a SaaS experience, and similarly, we can give our customers access to on premises technology in a lease model, which they\u2019ve used for a while. So we give our customers a choice of what they want to be in a position to do. ANSYS Cloud gives them that ability to support they need for cloud compute, both from the server perspective as well as scale up for HPC. So it really is up to the customers. And, many of our customers have made investments that are within their own to building out data centers, so they prefer to take advantage of their own data centers, some customers will look at the amount of data that they have to manage. I mean, when you think about a simulation, a complex multivariate simulation that\u2019s running across our multivariate optimization could result in terabytes of information. And so then there\u2019s a question of where do you store that information? How do you keep it? Do you move it from one cloud to another? What is their standard model? So it\u2019s not simply a matter of moving piece parts into the cloud. It\u2019s really thinking holistically from the part of the customers on where and how they want to make this transition, because it\u2019s an entire workflow that\u2019s across multiple vendors that needs to be managed. And I think we\u2019re very well positioned. Our technology is ready for the cloud. We\u2019re very well positioned. We\u2019re excited about our capabilities. And it really is a matter of meeting the customers as and when they\u2019re ready. And the way we built our product, Jackson, is that customers can bring their own licenses, right? So it turns, you can seamlessly take advantage of both ANSYS cloud compute capabilities as well as you can take advantage of the same license running on premises. And so, the fact that we give you the flexibility of managing that, that\u2019s what customers are looking for. And so, we\u2019re not asking them to give up their investments in their on-prem compute. If they\u2019ve got that, that\u2019s great. They can take advantage of that. In addition, they can take advantage of cloud. Or if they want to choose to completely take advantage of the cloud, they can do that too. So that flexibility is what customers are looking for, and we\u2019re in a position to support them with that. Yeah, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by the malleability. I think that, firstly, DYNA provided an explicit analysis capability into the portfolio, which obviously has use-cases, of wide variety of use-cases. And we\u2019ve continued to expand those use-cases within the ANSYS portfolio as we\u2019ve integrated the technologies together, and combine both explicit and implicit capabilities. It broadens the addressable opportunity. So that\u2019s obviously the case. I think perhaps you might be referring to the announcements we \u2013 the comment I made about Fujitsu. And I think in that, what is important to recognize is that the DYNA solver is available on the Fujitsu machine, on their PRIMEHPC supercomputer. And essentially because that machine is efficient, we can help our customers, because they\u2019re supporting DYNA on the \u2013 they\u2019re supporting their large-scale DYNA runs on the Fujitsu hardware platform. And that\u2019s more efficient, because they can offload some of their simulation workload onto to an efficient compute platform. So that was the point on that piece, and hopefully, that clarifies the comment about Fujitsu. Thanks, Kelsey. So, I\u2019m really excited about our excellent execution, our broad customer base and our robust pipeline. Our customers\u2019 reliance in simulation, the strengthening of the small and medium business market, and our ability to close large contracts only add to that excitement and give me further confidence as we look to close out 2021. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our customers and to our partners for their continued support. And a special thank you to my ANSYS colleagues. You have my gratitude for delivering yet another strong quarter. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Enjoy the rest of your day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and 2021. The third quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter. ACV was strong and in line with our expectations, while revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high-end of our Q3 guidance driven by the mix of license types sold in the quarter, both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well, and our growth during the quarter with broad-based. Now, let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $365.4 million, and grew year-over-year 20% or 19% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 76% of the total. Q3 total revenue was $445.4 million and grew 21% or 20% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded the high-end of our guidance driven by license mix. Q3 revenue growth was also wide ranging across tough customer types and industries. For the first 3 quarters of 2021, we had strong top-line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double-digit at 17% and 19%, respectively. As Ajei mentioned, for both Q3 and Q3 year-to-date, we are executing against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $899.5 million. During the quarter, we continue to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 89.9% and an operating margin of 39.7%, which was better than our Q3 guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance from license mix, as well as the timing of investments. The results with third quarter EPS of $1.59, which was also above the high-end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results from license mix and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in Q3 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q3 totaled $157.8 million, which benefited from strong collections, primarily driven by robust Q2 growth, favorable timing of intra-quarter sales, and a reduction in the percent of receivables past due. We ended the quarter with $1,081.4 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 97,000 shares during the quarter for around $36 million. We have 2.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, on October 1, we acquired Zemax for a purchase price of $399.1 million net of cash acquired. Now, let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year given the improved sales pipeline we see in the fourth quarter. As a result, we are initiating guidance for Q4 and increasing our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This raise reflects the strong financial performance in the third quarter and the increased momentum of our sales pipeline going into the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $614.9 million to $654.9 million, operating margin in the range of 44.5% to 47%, and EPS in the range of $2.48 to $2.81. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full-year ACV Outlook to be in the range of $1,825 million to $1,860 million. This represents growth of 12.9% to 15.1% or 12.6% to 14.7% in constant currency. Our Q4 and full year 2021 guidance is based on continued momentum in the business and a Q4 pipeline that has accelerated since our August guidance. It does not include a repeat of the outside spending behavior we saw in December 2020 after vaccines were announced. The raise also incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million of contribution from Zemax in Q4, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $20 million, which translates to an increase of 1.5 points of constant currency growth compared to our August guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1,885 million to $1,925 million, which is growth of 11.2% to 13.5% or 10.6% to 12.9% in constant currency. This raise reflects our strong Q3 revenue performance driven by license mix, as well as the incremental organic revenue from the momentum of our Q4 pipeline. Like ACV, our increased revenue incorporates approximately $6 million to $8 million contribution from Zemax, which is offset by approximately $6 million to $8 million of currency headwinds. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $40 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 3 points higher, than the midpoint of our August guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full-year basis, revenue growth is less volatile. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect the revenue growth rate to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of license types sold in the fourth quarter 2020 versus our current 2021 fourth quarter pipeline. We are increasing our full-year operating margin and now expect operating margin to be in the range of 40.5% to 41.5%. Additionally, we are increasing our full-year EPS, and now expect EPS to be in the range of $7.05 to $7.38. This increase incorporates our Q3 performance and is offset by approximately $0.05 of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that move from Q3 to the fourth quarter of the year. Now, let me turn to our full-year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $505 million to $535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year and is partially offset by approximately $3 million to $5 million of currency headwinds. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that has been factored into our Q4 and 2021 guidance are contained in the prepared remarks document. Consistent with our standard practice, we will provide detailed 2022 guidance once we finalize our 2022 planning process and close out 2021. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove our robust Q3 financial performance and continued momentum going into our last quarter of the year. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales pipeline, demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2021 outlook, as well as our longer-term financial objectives. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Yeah. So I\u2019ll take that. Thanks so much for your question, John. So, yes, as you can \u2013 as you point out, we are well within our model of double-digit growth. With tuck-in acquisitions on the year-to-date basis, our growth certainly puts us squarely on that model. What I would say is, there are 2 components to that. So the core itself, the core structures, fluids, those businesses are still solid contributors to growth and continue to grow. As you point out, we have been building the broadest, deepest simulation portfolio over multiple decades. And that has only accelerated in the past 5 years. And so, I think Ajei\u2019s talk about the optical business is an example of something that was maybe quite nascent, a couple of years ago, that is quite robust, competitive and extensive right now. And so, I would give that as an example. Ajei, do you want to comment anything for that? Good morning. Yeah. Thanks so much for your question, Andrew. So as you pointed out, over the last 12 months, America has continued to be a consistent strong performer, and lead the company in creating value for our customers. A couple of deals with the, one that Ajei mentioned in his remarks, the $58 million agreement with a leading North American technology company is an example of \u2013 I think the model that we have exported around the world and leaves some of the strength in our other regions like APAC, where the customer has already been using solutions from across the ANSYS multiphysics portfolio, but is now expanding the number of simulation users. And so, we\u2019ve done a very good job at building deep relationships with customers, understanding their short and their long-term development roadmaps, and enabling them to be able to propagate the use of simulation to broader use-cases, to connect to physics and to also connect to other users and in the process to leverage that simulation. And so, that model that America executes quite well, is the model that we\u2019re executing around the world. And just as an example, our Asia-Pacific region has executed exceptionally. They had another quarter, a very strong growth with 21%, constant currency growth \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 21% growth in the region at a constant currency basis. And the strength in that region was broad-based across industry, customer types, geographies. We had several 7 figure contracts in Asia Pacific, that added growth to the high-tech sector, where customers are really showing enthusiasm for not just the core portfolio, but the adjacencies as well. So there is a common theme here, where we\u2019re broadening and deepening the relationships within the customer, with our core technology, having strong footholds and solid growth, but also leveraging the organic and the inorganic investments that we\u2019ve been making over the past 5 years, to accelerate the footprint globally. And so, I would say the core strength of the portfolio and the investments that we\u2019ve been making, during the course of the pandemic, with our customers and in our portfolio are really the drivers of the acceleration and performance of growth. To some degree, there is a little bit of recovery. It\u2019s that Asia Pacific probably had a little bit ahead in the recovery versus America. There are still unevenness in terms of customers are preferring to meet in person. So I wouldn\u2019t characterize things as returned to normal quite yet. But certainly, the business model is resilient. It is showing through, regardless of the challenges that we\u2019ve seen in the pandemic. Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the success that the management team is enjoying as a result of building out that robust portfolio in that business model. But I think, also the point around investing during the pandemic is, is important to note. I mean, it\u2019s really easy in a tough time to barrel down the hatches and not make investments in the business. That\u2019s kind of what people might expect. But there is a very proactive or very deliberate decision to not over-pivot in that direction, because of our confidence in the opportunity around what we do and the value that we can add to our customers. And so, I really do feel like we\u2019re going to be coming out of the pandemic, whenever that might be in a real position of strength. Sure, I\u2019ll start and if there\u2019s anything you have to add \u2013 you\u2019d like to add, Ajei. So, yes, as I mentioned in our opening remarks, we continue to see strength in the SMB customer-set in Q3. And we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that we\u2019ve seen now 4 quarters in a row. And so, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s given us the confidence in continuing to raise throughout the year, in addition to the fact that our pipeline with our large customers is solid, robust, and continues to evolve and improve. And so, I\u2019m not sure that the two are interrelated. I think that they\u2019re somewhat related in the broader sense of recovery. But I do feel like, although we\u2019re not quite at pre-pandemic behavior within the SMB set, we\u2019re really pleased with the ongoing momentum, and what we\u2019ve been delivering in that business. Sure. So, in Q3, we had a really strong Q3 as you point out with that strong double-digit growth. Q3 ACV did come in line really close within our expectations. And so, the raise on ACV in Q4 is really a function of the improved momentum that has been building since the last time we shared guidance in August, across the board. And so, what I would say is when you look at how we delivered year to date and in the quarter, it\u2019s been pretty broad-based across industries and customers. And, that\u2019s kind of the reflection of what I would characterize the momentum in Q4. There is not any isolated one-off thing that is driving that view. It is more kind of an overall momentum building that you\u2019ve been seeing, as you rightly point out, we\u2019ve been able to raise throughout the year, I mean, as you recall in the beginning of the year, we still were not sure whether what the kind of dynamics around recovery were going to look like. And so, we\u2019ve been kind of sharing with you as we see things ahead of us, and systematically raising expectations over time. Yeah, so I can quickly answer that question on the contribution. So we expect \u2013 so we had \u2013 as we\u2019ve said, we think it\u2019ll have about $6 million to $8 million of ACV impact and revenue impact. This year, which will be offset by \u2013 largely offset by currency. Next year, we\u2019re estimating an incremental approximately $20 million in organic impact. Yeah, no, I would characterize it, as you recall perpetual licenses during the pandemic did take a quite a significant hit, particularly in the first 3 quarters of last year. And so they did recover quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year, which is one of the reasons why the compares a little more challenging in Q4. But customers continue to prefer time based licensing models, because it really enables them to be more flexible as their needs evolve. And so over the past several years, the business model has really been shifting away from perpetual licenses. If you look over longer periods of time, it\u2019s been pretty flat. And the growth has been primarily through the acceleration of leases. And so that\u2019s really built a very strong annuity business for us over the past 5 years, and has been a very successful evolution of the business. And so, while we did see \u2013 we are seeing kind of some of the compare effects in the first 3 quarters of this year, we believe over the long-term that the shift that customer \u2013 we\u2019re seeing from customers is going to continue towards that lease-based licensing. You\u2019re welcome. Yeah, I mean, I would say that the part of the business that customers are using on the cloud itself is very small and immaterial. The vast majority of the use-case is around seamless access to HPC capacity and other capacity outside the cloud, which has no impact on our current \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the same revenue recognition model that we have in the \u2013 whether it\u2019s a lease or perpetual license, because their entitlements would be separate from that usage."

I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we significantly beat our financial guidance across all our key metrics. I'm particularly pleased with our ACV performance for the quarter, which grew at nearly 23% in constant currency.  Our growing momentum from Q4 of 2020 and the first half of this year gives us increased confidence in our business and in our ability to execute against our goals. It is also further validation of our strategy of pervasive simulation, where simulation is used throughout the product development process by engineers in every discipline.  That strategy, combined with our best-in-class multi-physics products, our comprehensive go-to-market approach and our deep and lasting customer relationships has paved the way for our consistent success.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the uncertainties of the Delta variant making headlines around the world. Despite these uncertainties, our customers are continuing to invest in innovation, R&D and product design to drive their future successes.  As such, we are continuing to see demand for ANSYS simulation increase in the marketplace, and our pipeline for the remainder of 2021 is strong. As a result of that continued strength and our track record of execution, we are once again increasing our annual guidance for ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes.  Looking at Q2, all our major geographies performed well, with the Americas leading the way. I'm very proud of our team in India, which came in above our internal plan despite challenging COVID-19 related conditions in the country.  From an industry perspective, high tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation were our top verticals. We also saw ongoing strength with our enterprise customers.  Following the trend of the past two quarters, we saw improved spending with small and medium-sized customers. While these smaller customers have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic spending levels, the progress we've seen over the past several months give me added confidence in the future.  One of the largest deals of the quarter was with a North American leader in semiconductors. This $39 million multiyear agreement ensures that the company will have necessary capacity to run 5-nanometer and eventually 3-nanometer designs on ANSYS\u2019 RedHawk-SC, a gold standard power noise and reliability signoff solution for digital design.  The company has also standardized on ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics technology across chip, package and system to reduce power consumption, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the marketplace. We also closed a $30 million agreement with a longtime automotive customer.  This leader in electric vehicle technology has expanded its use of mechanical, fluids and electromagnetic solutions, and has adopted additional ANSYS technologies including automated design analyses, multi-body dynamics and process integration and design optimization.  This customer is working with the ANSYS ACE teams to jointly develop workflows for noise and vibration analysis and topology optimization. The company is also using ANSYS Discovery to decrease its simulation backlog and get products to market faster, all the while holding the line on development costs.  Just a few weeks ago, we unveiled ANSYS 2021 Release 2, which features advances across our multi-physics product line, from structures, fluids and electromagnetics to materials, photonics and embedded software. R2 includes a number of advancements in core physics, simplified workflows, and integrated data management.  Our solutions are based on our decades of experience and cannot be easily duplicated, creating high barriers to entry for potential competitors. While I could spend the entire hour detailing each product\u2019s capabilities, today, I will focus on just one key differentiator which cuts across our entire portfolio, namely scalability.  As customer problems become increasingly more challenging, the size of those challenges requires simulation software that can scale to unprecedented levels. Throughout our history, ANSYS has been a leader in product scalability, and we have extended that leadership in recent releases.  Our ability to create high resolution, fluid mechanics simulations with practical turnaround times enables customers to solve next generation challenges ranging from rotating machinery to external aerodynamics to environmental simulations.  Four years ago, ANSYS Fluent scaled to nearly 200,000 CPU cores, enabling customers to solve challenging problems faster than ever, by calculating billions of cells. To the best of our knowledge, that remains the record for commercial computational fluid dynamics code.  This massive scalability has enabled our customer at the Technical University in Eindhoven to solve a complex aerodynamic problem with 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. The most recent advances in ANSYS 2021 R2 have sped up parallel Mesh generation by 20x, removing what is often the bottleneck for detailed simulations of transient phenomena, which occur in aerodynamics and gas turbine simulations.  Our 225x speed up over the last decade has enabled ANSYS customers to reduce simulation time on a full thermal mechanical model from two weeks to an hour and a half. And now with ANSYS 2021 R2, those calculations could take just minutes, leading to improved product reliability as users run more simulations faster. That breakthrough was made possible by doubling the core counts, while reducing the memory required by 40%.  In our latest LS-DYNA release, we have significantly improved performance, which enables customers to run transient behavior studies with 28 trillion calculated variables, and that's trillion with a T. That means safer cars and more reliable electronics.  A global high tech customer used ANSYS HFSS and our new ANSYS Mesh Fusion to solve a previously unsolved integrated circuit and packaging problem by scaling across a multi-node HPC cluster with 18 terabytes of RAM and 576 cores.  In ANSYS 2021 R2, we introduced the Phi Plus mesher, which extends Mesh Fusion to deliver additional speed and capacity. Phi Plus has sped up meshing on PCB plus bondwire package models by 18x, which will bring new innovations to the 5G, autonomy and industrial Internet of Things market.  As the semiconductor customers are using next generation distributed and grid computing techniques to model and solve chips with 2.6 trillion or more devices, ANSYS RedHawk-SC set a capacity and performance record in power integrity signoff last year by extracting 66 billion electrical nodes on the design of a GPU and solving it over 2,400 CPUs in a fully distributed manner. In ANSYS 2021 R2, our solver performance doubled, enabling customers to signoff even larger chip designs using the same compute resources and runtime.  Scalability is one of ANSYS\u2019 many differentiators and is becoming increasingly important to our customers as they develop next generation products. We believe that our history of product scalability, along with accuracy, ease-of-use and speed to solution, create a difficult environment for any would-be competitor, while giving our users the functionality they need to solve the most challenging product problems.  We are continuing to train the next generation of engineers in the use of ANSYS solutions by expanding our free offering for students. To date, nearly 2 million students around the world have downloaded our products. And just a few weeks ago, we launched an additional offering for students to download our Electronics Desktop, and to enroll in ANSYS innovation courses for training.  These students now have access to our leading electronics products, including HFSS, Maxwell and Icepak to train them in developing the products of tomorrow. And thanks to our new partnership, Cornell University will design and develop online training courses with real-world applications from ANSYS.  Moving to partnerships, I'm excited to announce that we have expanded our work with TSMC to include new certifications for ANSYS RedHawk and ANSYS Totem. These new certifications for power network extraction, power integrity and reliability, signal electromigration and transistor level custom designs enable joint customers to meet critical power, thermal and reliability standards for next generation product applications. ANSYS continues to be recognized for our inventive approach to engineering technology. I'm proud that for the third year in a row, Fast Company has named us one of the best places to work for innovators. I'm even more excited that five of my colleagues have been recognized with the prestigious Women of Color STEM awards. These awards showcase the outstanding scientific and engineering achievements of women around the world. And ANSYS is proud of these pioneers, who serve as an inspiration for us all.  Turning to our environmental, social and governance initiatives, I'm pleased that MSCI has upgraded our ESG rating to AA, naming us a leader in the software and services industry. MSCI cited ANSYS\u2019 comprehensive talent pipeline relative to our peers, our focus on business ethics, and our capabilities in helping customers to innovate in areas such as clean technologies.  To summarize, Q2 was another great quarter for ANSYS, and a further validation that our pervasive simulation strategy is resonating with the market. Our strong sales pipeline, our ongoing momentum with enterprise customers, the resurgence of small and medium businesses, and our continued leadership across our product portfolio, give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole.\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021. Our strong Q2 results reflect an outstanding execution across our business which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all above our Q2 guidance.  As Ajei mentioned, Q2 ACV was especially strong and exceeded our expectations. Both our large enterprise customer and our small and medium-sized customer spending patterns performed better than expected and our growth during the quarter was broad based.  Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was 430.5 million and grew year-over-year 25% or 23% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 82% of the total.  Q2 total revenue was 452.6 million and grew 16% or 14% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Like ACV, Q2 revenue growth was strong across the business.  In the first half of 2021, we had strong top line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double digits, 16% and 18%, respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of 927.1 million, representing a 10% increase over last year's second quarter balance.  During the quarter, we continue to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 41.7%, which is better than our Q2 guidance.  Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of investments. The results for second quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments.  Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q2 totaled 118.9 million, which benefited from strong collections driven by a reduction in the percent of receivables past due and was partially offset by differences in the timing of tax payments as compared to Q2 2020. We ended the quarter with 958.2 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for Q3 and increasing our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong broad-based financial performance in the second quarter and our current sales pipeline.  For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of 400 million to 425 million and EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.39. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook.  We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of 1,800 million to 1,845 million. This represents growth of 11.4% to 14.1% or 10.8% to 13.5% in constant currency. We are raising our full year ACV guidance to reflect the Q2 performance which exceeded our expectations, and our increased confidence in the full year pipeline. This raise was offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 30 million, which translates to an increase of 2.7 points of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance.  As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarterly growth can be variable. As we mentioned in May, ACV quarterly growth rates in 2021 will vary with Q2 and Q3 being the strongest two quarters. Based on our performance in Q2, we expect Q2 to have the highest ACV growth rate for the year.  As a reminder, we still expect Q4 growth to be muted given the Q4 2020 growth comparisons. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of 1,840 million to 1,890 million, which is growth of 8.5% to 11.5% or 7.3% to 10.2% in constant currency.  Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q2 revenue performance and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by 23 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our May guidance.  As you know ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year revenue basis, revenue growth is less variable. In the second half of 2021, we expect revenue growth to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of business.  We are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.85 to $7.15. This increase incorporates our strong Q2 performance and is offset by a few cents of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of 495 million to 535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year, and continued improvement in payment terms toward pre-pandemic levels.  We are pleased with our strong first half in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, second half cash flow is most impacted by whether large Q4 deals close near the beginning or the end of the quarter.  For modeling purposes, we\u2019re expecting third quarter operating margin in the range of 34% to 36.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2021 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their continued commitment to our customers and fellow colleagues during this prolonged time of uncertainty. The team delivered exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q2 financial performance.  The combination of best-in-class execution with a strong recurring business model and growing sales pipeline sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 outlook, as well as our longer-term financial objectives.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Nicole, I just wanted to maybe check on ACV, really solid performance here. Would you characterize the strong results as just sort of increasing the conversion rate of the pipeline, or did you actually see an uptick in demand and potentially a boost to the overall pipeline that\u2019s giving you higher confidence in the raise?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. Thanks, Ken. Yes, we were really pleased with not only the second quarter, but where we landed on the first half overall, as you know, translated to 16% growth overall for the half, which was fantastic. The team really delivered. I would say that it went back to a very similar pattern that we saw in Q1, which was it was broad-based across geographies and industries. As you recall, coming into the year, we were a little bit cautious about SMB and kind of the underlying momentum of SMB. And we had expected enterprise customers to perform as expected. I would say in the second quarter, we got a bit more out of the enterprise than we expected to get, which was great, because it showed people are really seriously committing to their R&D portfolios and accelerating development. But we saw, for the second quarter in a row, that resurgence on the SMB side, and there wasn't anything that was specific, localized or kind of in narrow form. It was just kind of everywhere. So I would say it's that really kind of broad-based performance that we saw really in the second quarter and the first half that contributed to the confidence that we had in raising our overall ACV for the year by the 2.7 points at constant currency.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then you touched on SMB, also you guys mentioned that it was kind of tracking back towards pre-COVID levels. Any rough sense of kind of where we are? Not sure if there's a way to kind of quantify if we are maybe 60% of the way there, 70% of the way there. But would love to get a sense for how much more there is to close the gap before we're back to what you might consider normal for that piece of the business?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. As I mentioned before, we were really pleased with the momentum we saw in the quarter and the strength we saw. What I would is, the guidance that we have going into -- the reason the full year was really not counting on SMB coming back to those pre-pandemic levels. There certainly is a lot more activity, there's a lot more engagement. But this does happen over time market by market. It does vary too, in terms of the rate and pace of speed of how these customers are coming back. And so, while I don't have a specific quantification to give you, what I would say is that if it happened at a more accelerated rate that's not -- and we were all of a sudden back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, that's not something we've really contemplated in our race.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nGal Munda: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. The first one was just kind of reflect a little bit on brands in terms of operating cash flow and ACV and how ACV outperformance also kind of allows you to raise the cash flow estimates for the year. It's interesting, because what we've seen is 30 million upgrades in ACV resulted in about 15 million in operating cash flow, which kind of suggests that 50% incremental conversion. Is that something that we could -- is that something that as you continue to perform, it still kind of is replicable going forward? Just maybe a little bit in light of potential investments or something that you might also balance out on the other side?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So let me break apart the components of cash flow. So as you point out, cash flow is more highly correlated to ACV because of the way 606 treats revenue recognition, so that is exactly the right way to look at it. So there's two components to it. There's the collections piece along the ACV side, and then there's the payment side. And so on the collection side, we have seen an improvement at a more accelerated rate, both in terms of lack of asking for extension on payment terms, people catching up on each payment, and people overall maintaining a level of current balance at higher rates than they had through the pandemic. So all of that is I think contributing to the acceleration on -- part of the acceleration on the cash flow side. The headwind in this particular quarter was really tax payments and the timing of tax payments, particularly in a quarter can have a more distorting dynamic overall. And so, as you recall, last year, there were some deferral incentives during the pandemic that raised cash flow in the second quarter, and then this year those payments were due as expected in the second quarter. And so, overall, I would expect to see still a little bit of capitulation and volatility in the relationship between the two, just because the nature of the payment piece is not kind of back to normalized levels. But what you can count on is that underneath the covers, the momentum around collections and customers\u2019 kind of behavior around that has been quite good. And we're really happy with where we're at.\nGal Munda: Got you. And then just as a follow up, you said that SMB strength has really come in. And what we say usually is that SMB is a good indicator, leading indicator of the kind of underlying demands of the business The other way that you could say it also, if the larger deals are starting to kind of close a little bit earlier. Is that something that you're starting to see as well at better close rates? Did you have any plans potentially from a quarter as well?\nNicole Anasenes: I think that we saw a very balanced growth and performance across the enterprise side and the SMB side. And so what we are seeing is that customers are using simulation to continue to accelerate their development roadmaps and the optimism around needing to make those investments overall. And so there was really no timing dynamic here of any meaningful -- to any meaningful degree other than the normal things that followed before and after the dateline in any normal quarter. It really is -- the performance in the quarter was really a statement of the overall momentum that we're seeing in customers\u2019 behavior overall.\nGal Munda: Right, which is supported by the smaller deals as well. Awesome. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe just on ANSYS Cloud, Ajei, would love an update there and how things are tracking as we think about post pandemic plans?\nAjei Gopal: Sure, Adam. So, as you know, ANSYS Cloud provides managed access to HPC resources and that allows our customers to essentially run larger and higher fidelity simulations. And as you know, the cloud also supports a very flexible licensing model. And that includes an elastic pay-as-you-go model as well as a hybrid model that allows customers to mix and match elastic as well as lease licenses. Now we have a number of internal metrics that we deploy to measure the business. And we are seeing probably a 5x greater usage as compared with this time last year. And that has very nice growth as a result of the activities that we've done as well as, of course, external conditions with people working from home. This year, if you think about what we've done to augment the cloud, we've added cloud support for ANSYS LSTC, for ANSYS DYNA, for our Lumerical products. We've completed SOC2 certification and we also continue to focus on the overall customer experience. And that's really translated very positively for customers. And we -- a couple of months ago, few months ago, we published a release about a customer, Van Oord, who talked about how they could speed up their simulations by 7x, which obviously is a significant perspective, because they're able to take advantage of the most recent and most capable hardware in the cloud, as well as the cloud capabilities that we have. So we're very excited about our cloud direction. We have made all of the necessary investments. And, of course, it's still early days, because we're talking about a relatively small portion of our business.\nAdam Borg: That's really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow up for Nicole, just on perpetual license. That's been really strong in the last few quarters. I know there's been this ongoing trend towards term versus paid off. But I'd love to think about or hear a little bit more about how you're thinking about perpetual license growth over the back half of the year? And is that strength in part due just to increase in confidence in the markets and the ability to deploy larger deals like that? Thanks so much.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So we did see -- in the first half of the year, we did see relatively more professional license growth than we've seen in the past. And what I would say is that that long-term trend of shifting towards the lease model still continues, right. So as you recall, there were dynamics last year where perpetual was a little bit more muted. And I think what you're seeing this year is just some of the return of some of that business overall. But if you look at the business over longer periods of time, the growth and acceleration of the business is really driven by the lease model, and the perpetual business has been roughly flat over those longer periods of time. In terms of the second half, I think one of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 last year was not only exceeding the high end of guidance by $45 million, but there was a significant perpetual mix in Q4. And so how we're looking at it on a go-forward basis is not really expecting that repeat performance in Q4 overall. It is some of the underlying factors that are baked into the guidance.\nAdam Borg: Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, for you first. Within the context of your large multi-solution solver sales, could you talk about the incremental demand within those deals that you may be seeing for any or all of the smaller brands such as Minerva, Granta, Esterel, [indiscernible] and so forth. Are those becoming incrementally important within the context of those deals? And then as well, in your prepared remarks, you noted your semiconductor and high tech business. As this week is the 10th anniversary of the Apache acquisition closing, perhaps you could share your thoughts and how you're thinking about your EDA business for the next number of years, and the kinds of internal investments that you think you'll need to be making over the next number of years to keep that business growing? And then lastly, for Nicole, your services revenue were down sequentially in Q1. And yet over the last few months, there's been a discernible uptick in your openings for technical support and consulting positions. So from that, should we infer that you are anticipating an improving pipeline in terms of engagements and deployments activity?\nAjei Gopal: Jay, thanks for the question. Let me start with your comments or question about some of the smaller products. As you know, some of those products organically developed, others came in through acquisition. And we embark on activities such as an M&A or organic development, specifically when we see opportunities in the market where customers are either leading us or where we see an opportunity to provide greater functionality to solve the customer problem. And so all of the acquisitions or an all of the internal development that we do is driven by an analysis of what that market would look like. And I'm delighted that we're generally seeing what we expected to see pan out is in fact panning out. You talked about Lumerical photonics, that's obviously a very important part as you think about data centers, for example, and we're seeing obvious attraction there, because this product fits into our overall portfolio. So when we go to customers, we can go to them with a broader set of capabilities that includes critical capabilities, such as Lumerical, that you mentioned, where we can go in and talk about an end to end solution that addresses the needs that the customer may have. And you see that repeated across our portfolio, where smaller products are playing important roles in being able to stitch together an end to end workflow to allow customers to solve some of the most complex problems that they're dealing with. So I think that's -- hopefully that addresses your first question. With respect to your second question, I'm excited, obviously, with our performance in high tech and semiconductor. I no longer think of the Apache acquisition. That's part of our semiconductor organization and has been for a number of years. And obviously we have a number of deep integrations across our portfolio between our semiconductor business and our electromagnetics activities. And you start to think about next generation products like 3D-IC and challenges, and that's when the entire ANSYS portfolio comes in, going from our semiconductor portfolio all the way through our more Newtonian physics, if you will. And so I'm very excited about the portfolio, the capabilities. I think we have market leading products across the board there. And customers tell us that they're able to solve tremendous challenges with our offerings, and we're excited about the future.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And, Jay, to your services question. So specifically, this year we really -- we do expect to see services disproportionately impacted by COVID, just because of the nature of services being more in-person, particularly with the Delta variant and some of the either self-imposed or imposed restrictions that customers are having around in-person engagement. So we're not anticipating in our guidance any increase -- any meaningful change in the trajectory of the services business. In terms of the skill sets that you're referring to, I\u2019d say that, yes, we are hiring, we are investing in the business, we're investing in the areas that you and Ajei just discussed now around helping our customers connect physics together with multi-physics. And so those are skill sets that we continue to invest in. And that services business is also -- that investment in the services business is also a reflection of the momentum we're seeing in the pipeline around sales, because those individuals also support selling process to some degree. So, overall, I think what you're seeing is a good set of momentum around customers starting -- continuing to accelerate their R&D pipelines and leveraging ANSYS to do so. And that's why we're making the investments in this space.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Just looking at the indirect channel, it seems like it's performing very well. Are there any partnerships that are really gaining traction, or other reasons for this growth? And you might have touched on them in your previous comments, but just unpack that?\nAjei Gopal: Yes, you should think of our indirect channel consistent with some of the growth that we're seeing in SMB, because our indirect channel partners are oftentimes supporting customers who are lower down in the pyramid, while some of the larger global organizations are handled by a direct sales force. So that's really the dynamic that you're seeing, and that growth is reflective of that dynamic.\nAndrew Obin: And just a broader question. Your outperformance this quarter internally, how do you think as you put it into three buckets? One, reopening; b, your customers structurally investing more; and c, just your strategy as you're sort of expanding and getting your products in the partners\u2019 ecosystem adjacencies. Internally, if you're trying to sort of attribute this outperformance this quarter, short-term macro, long-term structural thing or your strategy, how would you sort of our allocate the outperformance into these three buckets? Sorry for a long question.\nAjei Gopal: I think it's really difficult to point to a specific allocation of one bucket to another, because these things are all related to each other. At the end of the day, if you just reflect on the ANSYS portfolio, what we built is a market leading set of capabilities of individual physics, which are connected together. And so this multi-physics capability is what's necessary for customers as they solve some of the most challenging problems that they're dealing with. And so as you think about electrification, for example, or 5G or IoT, all of these areas are complex customers that are investing a significant amount of money, they are looking for simulation offerings to be able to support them in their R&D efforts. And we have the technology, we have the capabilities, we have the relationships, and we can support them on their journey. So that's a very important aspect. You've got to have the right goods when people need them. The second thing is that, obviously, around the world, we're seeing a set -- we're seeing customers recognizing that there is going to be an end to the pandemic, and that they have to continue to make investments in R&D. And certainly the small and medium business customers are perhaps most emblematic of that, because they are -- early in the pandemic, you saw a shutdown for SMB customers, right. They\u2019re most concerned about cash, they're most concerned about the potential demand future because these are smaller companies and they have less, they have lesser cash resources than some of the larger companies. But what we're seeing now is obviously an opening up of spending there, which is reflective of the fact that customers around the world, not just SMB customers, customers around the world are looking at the world after things completely open up again, or certainly after a pandemic world, post pandemic world where things start to get back to normal with respect to the broader economy, which means -- and they recognize that in order for them to be successful, they have to have products that people want. And that means more investment in R&D and more investment in product design, as I mentioned in my comments. So the demand is also increasing. And I think that those two things work together. You have to have the right products. You have to have the growing demand. If you didn't have either one of them, you wouldn't necessarily be able to deliver the results. And I think that we are -- that's exactly what we're seeing. And we're very excited about what we can provide to our customers and where the market is going.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And I would add just one additional point to what Ajei said, which is the ANSYS team and the execution of that team. The sales team and services teams were there alongside customers throughout the pandemic. We've made investments in supporting our customers throughout that pandemic. And that puts us in a position of strength as customers are coming out of it and making the decisions that Ajei referred to. As you know, enterprise software sales cycles are long. So if you're not there and you're not committed to your customers and you're not delivering value even in times where they're not quite ready to invest at the levels that they're comfortable with in a time like the pandemic, it pays off in the end. And you can see that particularly in some of our markets like Asia Pac and other places where the team has just been exceptional in the way that they have managed and deepen those relationships with customers.\nAjei Gopal: Was there a follow up?\nAndrew Obin: Apologies. I put myself on mute. No. Thank you very much.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here and fitting me in. Nicole, maybe just for you, just a little bit of a housekeeping question. I think you mentioned the ACV constant currency guide was about 10.8% to 13.5%. Can you just remind us how much of that is organic versus inorganic?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So at the beginning of the year, we talked about AGI contributing $80 million to this year. And so we're still seeing that as the current trajectory.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow up, maybe for you, Ajei. Can you just talk a little bit about Simulation Live and how you feel that's trending? I noticed a little bit of a longer -- sort of a long-term story, but curious what the update is and how you feel about it?\nAjei Gopal: You mean Discovery, right?\nSaket Kalia: I\u2019m sorry. Yes, absolutely, Discovery Live. Sorry, I was calling to PTC. Discovery Live, yes.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. So, look, we're very excited about Discovery. And I think perhaps to make it real, a little bit more tangible, perhaps I can go back to the example I gave in the script, which was one of our customers who's using Discovery in a very interesting way. So for this particular customer, some of the detailed flow and thermal management simulation is done by experts using ANSYS flagship products. But the typical turnaround time is maybe 60 days, because of the complexity of the simulation. And they have a relatively small analyst team serving a larger design team. So they introduced Discovery as a way for the design engineers to do some of the simpler simulation on their own. So things like flow distribution or pressure drops. So they're able to do that by themselves. And they can improve the design of their components before they hand off the design for a complete system simulation to the expert analysts. So that's an example where the whole thesis that we had was, this is something that design engineers could use to really amplify the capability of the analysts, that's something that's borne out here. And for this customer, they're also using -- they also have some outsourced CAE spend, and they're using Discovery now to help train their designers on some basic structural analysis so they can limit some of this outsourced work on simple geometry changes. And what that does for them is it changes the design iteration time and it takes it down from a couple of weeks to a couple of days. So that gives you some perspective. We're very excited about the technology. We continue to make advances in the technology. And obviously I mentioned a couple of customer examples. You talked briefly about PTC and the use of Creo Simulation Live. And on PTC\u2019s earnings call last week, I believe they reported continued traction with increased expansions driven by a migration around Creo 7. As you know, they are OEM-ing our Discovery products into Creo Simulation Live, Creo ANSYS simulation, and Creo 7 is their latest enterprise release. And so, obviously, there's increased traction that comes from that. And they also talked about a customer where the real-time simulation capabilities were helping to simplify the customer's design process. So we're very, very excited about the technology. It continues to perform as we had expected. Obviously, it's a relatively small piece of our business. But the market dynamics around what we're seeing is strong.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nJohn Walsh: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your acquisition pipeline. You were able to get Phoenix done, which looks like it bolts on nicely to AGI. Just what are you seeing there and what can we kind of expect there from a capital allocation perspective?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So, as you point out, the greatest return we've been able to provide on the deployment of excess cash has been utilizing it to acquire a second M&A. And the example of something like Phoenix is a great example of a premier technology which helps us accelerate. Another investment we made in December around in AGI. Phoenix provides model-based engineering. So I would say that you should expect that we will continue to execute strategy, which is consistent with our model, which is to achieve double digit growth with tuck-in acquisitions overall. So the decision on -- the capital allocation decision and the focus on M&A hasn't changed.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And maybe just a follow up to that. During the quarter, you had put out a press release about a customer looks like expanding the relationship they had with ANSYS. One of the things that I found interesting was more stringent regulations around greenhouse gas reduction and how they're using simulation to help that. You've talked in the past about sustainability and how you can help your customers. But the drumbeat just seems to be getting louder and louder. Are you seeing customers accelerate any decisions around this sustainability focus, or is it still -- is that still kind of an extra add-on benefit to what you're already bringing to the customer?\nAjei Gopal: So I think the sustainability aspect is clearly important across a number of different dimensions for different customers. When you look at, let's say, for example, a big trend in the automotive industry, which is around electrification, right? Obviously, there's a discussion about the future of the internal combustion engine and the rate and pace at which electric cars and vehicles will be adopted broadly. And you're seeing car companies, for example, making the decision to just simply move from one to the other. And that's obviously driven in part by issues of emissions and being more eco-friendly. We talked last year about -- in the aerospace industry, we talked about some customer wins, where the motivation for the customer was really to make their engines more fuel efficient. So it was about light-weighting, it was about reduced fuel consumption, increased efficiency of fuel. And so even in aircraft engines, for example, you're seeing that as being a primary driver for new design of engines. And so it's absolutely part of a broader trend. I mentioned Van Oord earlier. They're, of course, building sustainable offshore wind turbines. And they're a simulation user. But again, their focus is on renewable energy sources. So compliance purposes as well as eco-friendly, all of these things are drivers of product design and product requirements. And obviously to ensure that customers can meet those standards, simulation plays a really important role.\nJohn Walsh: Great. I appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nBlair Abernethy: Thank you and nice quarter, guys. Just a vertical question here, Ajei, just first off on the auto vertical. As you look at the shift from ICE development to electrical vehicles, obviously a completely different product. Is there -- do you have a sense at this stage as they move away from ICE design and new model introductions to pure electrical, what is the ANSYS footprint change in the auto vertical look like? Does it grow or does it -- obviously 10 years from now, maybe we have a lot less ICE engineers out there. And secondly, you called out in your prepared remarks the healthcare vertical and a large win in using simulation software to train some algorithms. Can you just maybe expand on that a bit? And how big might that opportunity be in the healthcare vertical? Thanks.\nAjei Gopal: Firstly, with respect to automotive, what's exciting for us is that we have the technology and the capabilities from a product perspective and a relationship perspective to support our customers as they go through that transition. So we can help them with battery management technologies. We can help them with electric drive trains, electric motor design, all of the elements that you would expect that would sort of go into the replacement of the internal combustion engine with an electric battery powered environment. But above and beyond that, if you think about the challenges that some of our customers are facing as they make this transition, an electric car is not just simply an internal combustion car with one means of propulsion replacing another, it's an opportunity for our customers to redesign. In fact, they have to redesign it, because the assumptions that are previously made of an engine in the front of the car, which concentrates the weight in the front of the car, those assumptions are no longer relevant, because perhaps now you have a battery that's uniformly distributed across the floor of the car. And so that changes the weight distribution and changes the assumptions of the way that the car was originally designed. And so there is a significant rethinking taking place in these car companies, especially the auto companies who have historically relied on the reuse of technology from one generation to another, there is a rethinking of saying, what does it mean for us to support this to build an electric car? And so all of that leads to and drives increased use of simulation and certainly for ANSYS simulation. You think about crash design, right? So the problems that you may have been dealing with earlier for crash might have been, how do you think about the passenger and will the passenger be protected? And that's a complex multi-physics problem, because you're dealing with the structural integrity, you're dealing with the deployment of the airbag, which is the fluids problem. So there's a multi-physics problems in nature that need to be addressed through simulation. Now the question is, it goes above and beyond that, and it says, well, what is the likelihood of a fire or some kind of a catastrophic fire that might take place as a result of a battery rupture? Can you solve that problem? So it starts to become more and more challenging. And so this transition is not just a matter of supporting the design of the engine per se, it is the actual car in the aggregate and that sort of plays well to our strengths and our capabilities.  Now with respect to your second question about healthcare. While healthcare is still and overall a relatively small part of the ANSYS business, simulation continues to grow. And we do well in, for example, the design and the manufacturing of medical devices. And that was obviously reflected in the performance in the quarter. But as we look to the future, we are excited about the increased use of simulation as a validation in the market. So the use of in-silico trials as opposed to just in vitro, in vivo. And the use of simulation techniques supporting those in-silico trials I think is really helpful. And we're working with early adopters who are using simulation to target specific surgical outcomes. And this is obviously early, early stage. There's not really much revenue associated with it; very, very early stage. But this is about how do you support a physician as they\u2019re making decisions about surgery. Those are at the end of the day, some of those can be simplified into problems of computational fluid dynamics. And, of course, we have fantastic technology in that space. And so being able to put all of that together and packaging that, I think that's certainly something for the future.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Thank you. That's all the time we have today. I will turn it over to Ajei to make some closing comments.\nAjei Gopal: So thank you all for your questions. And I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS and our global partner network for your amazing work, your dedication to the company and for continuing to drive the success for ANSYS and our thousands of customers around the world.  With our excellent start to the year, a strong pipeline and the unprecedented levels of innovation that we're driving across our multi-physics products, I'm confident that we will meet our newly raised goals for 2021.  And with that, thank you all for attending today's call. And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we significantly beat our financial guidance across all our key metrics. I'm particularly pleased with our ACV performance for the quarter, which grew at nearly 23% in constant currency.  Our growing momentum from Q4 of 2020 and the first half of this year gives us increased confidence in our business and in our ability to execute against our goals. It is also further validation of our strategy of pervasive simulation, where simulation is used throughout the product development process by engineers in every discipline.  That strategy, combined with our best-in-class multi-physics products, our comprehensive go-to-market approach and our deep and lasting customer relationships has paved the way for our consistent success.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with the uncertainties of the Delta variant making headlines around the world. Despite these uncertainties, our customers are continuing to invest in innovation, R&D and product design to drive their future successes.  As such, we are continuing to see demand for ANSYS simulation increase in the marketplace, and our pipeline for the remainder of 2021 is strong. As a result of that continued strength and our track record of execution, we are once again increasing our annual guidance for ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes.  Looking at Q2, all our major geographies performed well, with the Americas leading the way. I'm very proud of our team in India, which came in above our internal plan despite challenging COVID-19 related conditions in the country.  From an industry perspective, high tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation were our top verticals. We also saw ongoing strength with our enterprise customers.  Following the trend of the past two quarters, we saw improved spending with small and medium-sized customers. While these smaller customers have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic spending levels, the progress we've seen over the past several months give me added confidence in the future.  One of the largest deals of the quarter was with a North American leader in semiconductors. This $39 million multiyear agreement ensures that the company will have necessary capacity to run 5-nanometer and eventually 3-nanometer designs on ANSYS\u2019 RedHawk-SC, a gold standard power noise and reliability signoff solution for digital design.  The company has also standardized on ANSYS\u2019 multi-physics technology across chip, package and system to reduce power consumption, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the marketplace. We also closed a $30 million agreement with a longtime automotive customer.  This leader in electric vehicle technology has expanded its use of mechanical, fluids and electromagnetic solutions, and has adopted additional ANSYS technologies including automated design analyses, multi-body dynamics and process integration and design optimization.  This customer is working with the ANSYS ACE teams to jointly develop workflows for noise and vibration analysis and topology optimization. The company is also using ANSYS Discovery to decrease its simulation backlog and get products to market faster, all the while holding the line on development costs.  Just a few weeks ago, we unveiled ANSYS 2021 Release 2, which features advances across our multi-physics product line, from structures, fluids and electromagnetics to materials, photonics and embedded software. R2 includes a number of advancements in core physics, simplified workflows, and integrated data management.  Our solutions are based on our decades of experience and cannot be easily duplicated, creating high barriers to entry for potential competitors. While I could spend the entire hour detailing each product\u2019s capabilities, today, I will focus on just one key differentiator which cuts across our entire portfolio, namely scalability.  As customer problems become increasingly more challenging, the size of those challenges requires simulation software that can scale to unprecedented levels. Throughout our history, ANSYS has been a leader in product scalability, and we have extended that leadership in recent releases.  Our ability to create high resolution, fluid mechanics simulations with practical turnaround times enables customers to solve next generation challenges ranging from rotating machinery to external aerodynamics to environmental simulations.  Four years ago, ANSYS Fluent scaled to nearly 200,000 CPU cores, enabling customers to solve challenging problems faster than ever, by calculating billions of cells. To the best of our knowledge, that remains the record for commercial computational fluid dynamics code.  This massive scalability has enabled our customer at the Technical University in Eindhoven to solve a complex aerodynamic problem with 3 billion computational cells with 20 billion unknowns. The most recent advances in ANSYS 2021 R2 have sped up parallel Mesh generation by 20x, removing what is often the bottleneck for detailed simulations of transient phenomena, which occur in aerodynamics and gas turbine simulations.  Our 225x speed up over the last decade has enabled ANSYS customers to reduce simulation time on a full thermal mechanical model from two weeks to an hour and a half. And now with ANSYS 2021 R2, those calculations could take just minutes, leading to improved product reliability as users run more simulations faster. That breakthrough was made possible by doubling the core counts, while reducing the memory required by 40%.  In our latest LS-DYNA release, we have significantly improved performance, which enables customers to run transient behavior studies with 28 trillion calculated variables, and that's trillion with a T. That means safer cars and more reliable electronics.  A global high tech customer used ANSYS HFSS and our new ANSYS Mesh Fusion to solve a previously unsolved integrated circuit and packaging problem by scaling across a multi-node HPC cluster with 18 terabytes of RAM and 576 cores.  In ANSYS 2021 R2, we introduced the Phi Plus mesher, which extends Mesh Fusion to deliver additional speed and capacity. Phi Plus has sped up meshing on PCB plus bondwire package models by 18x, which will bring new innovations to the 5G, autonomy and industrial Internet of Things market.  As the semiconductor customers are using next generation distributed and grid computing techniques to model and solve chips with 2.6 trillion or more devices, ANSYS RedHawk-SC set a capacity and performance record in power integrity signoff last year by extracting 66 billion electrical nodes on the design of a GPU and solving it over 2,400 CPUs in a fully distributed manner. In ANSYS 2021 R2, our solver performance doubled, enabling customers to signoff even larger chip designs using the same compute resources and runtime.  Scalability is one of ANSYS\u2019 many differentiators and is becoming increasingly important to our customers as they develop next generation products. We believe that our history of product scalability, along with accuracy, ease-of-use and speed to solution, create a difficult environment for any would-be competitor, while giving our users the functionality they need to solve the most challenging product problems.  We are continuing to train the next generation of engineers in the use of ANSYS solutions by expanding our free offering for students. To date, nearly 2 million students around the world have downloaded our products. And just a few weeks ago, we launched an additional offering for students to download our Electronics Desktop, and to enroll in ANSYS innovation courses for training.  These students now have access to our leading electronics products, including HFSS, Maxwell and Icepak to train them in developing the products of tomorrow. And thanks to our new partnership, Cornell University will design and develop online training courses with real-world applications from ANSYS.  Moving to partnerships, I'm excited to announce that we have expanded our work with TSMC to include new certifications for ANSYS RedHawk and ANSYS Totem. These new certifications for power network extraction, power integrity and reliability, signal electromigration and transistor level custom designs enable joint customers to meet critical power, thermal and reliability standards for next generation product applications. ANSYS continues to be recognized for our inventive approach to engineering technology. I'm proud that for the third year in a row, Fast Company has named us one of the best places to work for innovators. I'm even more excited that five of my colleagues have been recognized with the prestigious Women of Color STEM awards. These awards showcase the outstanding scientific and engineering achievements of women around the world. And ANSYS is proud of these pioneers, who serve as an inspiration for us all.  Turning to our environmental, social and governance initiatives, I'm pleased that MSCI has upgraded our ESG rating to AA, naming us a leader in the software and services industry. MSCI cited ANSYS\u2019 comprehensive talent pipeline relative to our peers, our focus on business ethics, and our capabilities in helping customers to innovate in areas such as clean technologies.  To summarize, Q2 was another great quarter for ANSYS, and a further validation that our pervasive simulation strategy is resonating with the market. Our strong sales pipeline, our ongoing momentum with enterprise customers, the resurgence of small and medium businesses, and our continued leadership across our product portfolio, give me further confidence in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Sure, Adam. So, as you know, ANSYS Cloud provides managed access to HPC resources and that allows our customers to essentially run larger and higher fidelity simulations. And as you know, the cloud also supports a very flexible licensing model. And that includes an elastic pay-as-you-go model as well as a hybrid model that allows customers to mix and match elastic as well as lease licenses. Now we have a number of internal metrics that we deploy to measure the business. And we are seeing probably a 5x greater usage as compared with this time last year. And that has very nice growth as a result of the activities that we've done as well as, of course, external conditions with people working from home. This year, if you think about what we've done to augment the cloud, we've added cloud support for ANSYS LSTC, for ANSYS DYNA, for our Lumerical products. We've completed SOC2 certification and we also continue to focus on the overall customer experience. And that's really translated very positively for customers. And we -- a couple of months ago, few months ago, we published a release about a customer, Van Oord, who talked about how they could speed up their simulations by 7x, which obviously is a significant perspective, because they're able to take advantage of the most recent and most capable hardware in the cloud, as well as the cloud capabilities that we have. So we're very excited about our cloud direction. We have made all of the necessary investments. And, of course, it's still early days, because we're talking about a relatively small portion of our business. Jay, thanks for the question. Let me start with your comments or question about some of the smaller products. As you know, some of those products organically developed, others came in through acquisition. And we embark on activities such as an M&A or organic development, specifically when we see opportunities in the market where customers are either leading us or where we see an opportunity to provide greater functionality to solve the customer problem. And so all of the acquisitions or an all of the internal development that we do is driven by an analysis of what that market would look like. And I'm delighted that we're generally seeing what we expected to see pan out is in fact panning out. You talked about Lumerical photonics, that's obviously a very important part as you think about data centers, for example, and we're seeing obvious attraction there, because this product fits into our overall portfolio. So when we go to customers, we can go to them with a broader set of capabilities that includes critical capabilities, such as Lumerical, that you mentioned, where we can go in and talk about an end to end solution that addresses the needs that the customer may have. And you see that repeated across our portfolio, where smaller products are playing important roles in being able to stitch together an end to end workflow to allow customers to solve some of the most complex problems that they're dealing with. So I think that's -- hopefully that addresses your first question. With respect to your second question, I'm excited, obviously, with our performance in high tech and semiconductor. I no longer think of the Apache acquisition. That's part of our semiconductor organization and has been for a number of years. And obviously we have a number of deep integrations across our portfolio between our semiconductor business and our electromagnetics activities. And you start to think about next generation products like 3D-IC and challenges, and that's when the entire ANSYS portfolio comes in, going from our semiconductor portfolio all the way through our more Newtonian physics, if you will. And so I'm very excited about the portfolio, the capabilities. I think we have market leading products across the board there. And customers tell us that they're able to solve tremendous challenges with our offerings, and we're excited about the future. Good morning. Yes, you should think of our indirect channel consistent with some of the growth that we're seeing in SMB, because our indirect channel partners are oftentimes supporting customers who are lower down in the pyramid, while some of the larger global organizations are handled by a direct sales force. So that's really the dynamic that you're seeing, and that growth is reflective of that dynamic. I think it's really difficult to point to a specific allocation of one bucket to another, because these things are all related to each other. At the end of the day, if you just reflect on the ANSYS portfolio, what we built is a market leading set of capabilities of individual physics, which are connected together. And so this multi-physics capability is what's necessary for customers as they solve some of the most challenging problems that they're dealing with. And so as you think about electrification, for example, or 5G or IoT, all of these areas are complex customers that are investing a significant amount of money, they are looking for simulation offerings to be able to support them in their R&D efforts. And we have the technology, we have the capabilities, we have the relationships, and we can support them on their journey. So that's a very important aspect. You've got to have the right goods when people need them. The second thing is that, obviously, around the world, we're seeing a set -- we're seeing customers recognizing that there is going to be an end to the pandemic, and that they have to continue to make investments in R&D. And certainly the small and medium business customers are perhaps most emblematic of that, because they are -- early in the pandemic, you saw a shutdown for SMB customers, right. They\u2019re most concerned about cash, they're most concerned about the potential demand future because these are smaller companies and they have less, they have lesser cash resources than some of the larger companies. But what we're seeing now is obviously an opening up of spending there, which is reflective of the fact that customers around the world, not just SMB customers, customers around the world are looking at the world after things completely open up again, or certainly after a pandemic world, post pandemic world where things start to get back to normal with respect to the broader economy, which means -- and they recognize that in order for them to be successful, they have to have products that people want. And that means more investment in R&D and more investment in product design, as I mentioned in my comments. So the demand is also increasing. And I think that those two things work together. You have to have the right products. You have to have the growing demand. If you didn't have either one of them, you wouldn't necessarily be able to deliver the results. And I think that we are -- that's exactly what we're seeing. And we're very excited about what we can provide to our customers and where the market is going. Was there a follow up? Thank you. You mean Discovery, right? Yes. So, look, we're very excited about Discovery. And I think perhaps to make it real, a little bit more tangible, perhaps I can go back to the example I gave in the script, which was one of our customers who's using Discovery in a very interesting way. So for this particular customer, some of the detailed flow and thermal management simulation is done by experts using ANSYS flagship products. But the typical turnaround time is maybe 60 days, because of the complexity of the simulation. And they have a relatively small analyst team serving a larger design team. So they introduced Discovery as a way for the design engineers to do some of the simpler simulation on their own. So things like flow distribution or pressure drops. So they're able to do that by themselves. And they can improve the design of their components before they hand off the design for a complete system simulation to the expert analysts. So that's an example where the whole thesis that we had was, this is something that design engineers could use to really amplify the capability of the analysts, that's something that's borne out here. And for this customer, they're also using -- they also have some outsourced CAE spend, and they're using Discovery now to help train their designers on some basic structural analysis so they can limit some of this outsourced work on simple geometry changes. And what that does for them is it changes the design iteration time and it takes it down from a couple of weeks to a couple of days. So that gives you some perspective. We're very excited about the technology. We continue to make advances in the technology. And obviously I mentioned a couple of customer examples. You talked briefly about PTC and the use of Creo Simulation Live. And on PTC\u2019s earnings call last week, I believe they reported continued traction with increased expansions driven by a migration around Creo 7. As you know, they are OEM-ing our Discovery products into Creo Simulation Live, Creo ANSYS simulation, and Creo 7 is their latest enterprise release. And so, obviously, there's increased traction that comes from that. And they also talked about a customer where the real-time simulation capabilities were helping to simplify the customer's design process. So we're very, very excited about the technology. It continues to perform as we had expected. Obviously, it's a relatively small piece of our business. But the market dynamics around what we're seeing is strong. Good morning. So I think the sustainability aspect is clearly important across a number of different dimensions for different customers. When you look at, let's say, for example, a big trend in the automotive industry, which is around electrification, right? Obviously, there's a discussion about the future of the internal combustion engine and the rate and pace at which electric cars and vehicles will be adopted broadly. And you're seeing car companies, for example, making the decision to just simply move from one to the other. And that's obviously driven in part by issues of emissions and being more eco-friendly.

And so even in aircraft engines, for example, you're seeing that as being a primary driver for new design of engines. And so it's absolutely part of a broader trend. I mentioned Van Oord earlier.

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and 2021. Our strong Q2 results reflect an outstanding execution across our business which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS, all above our Q2 guidance.  As Ajei mentioned, Q2 ACV was especially strong and exceeded our expectations. Both our large enterprise customer and our small and medium-sized customer spending patterns performed better than expected and our growth during the quarter was broad based.  Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was 430.5 million and grew year-over-year 25% or 23% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources represented 82% of the total.  Q2 total revenue was 452.6 million and grew 16% or 14% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Like ACV, Q2 revenue growth was strong across the business.  In the first half of 2021, we had strong top line performance with ACV and revenue both growing double digits, 16% and 18%, respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of 927.1 million, representing a 10% increase over last year's second quarter balance.  During the quarter, we continue to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 90% and an operating margin of 41.7%, which is better than our Q2 guidance.  Operating margin was positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of investments. The results for second quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also above the high end of our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments.  Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 19%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q2 totaled 118.9 million, which benefited from strong collections driven by a reduction in the percent of receivables past due and was partially offset by differences in the timing of tax payments as compared to Q2 2020. We ended the quarter with 958.2 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q2, we are initiating guidance for Q3 and increasing our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong broad-based financial performance in the second quarter and our current sales pipeline.  For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of 400 million to 425 million and EPS in the range of $1.22 to $1.39. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook.  We are increasing our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of 1,800 million to 1,845 million. This represents growth of 11.4% to 14.1% or 10.8% to 13.5% in constant currency. We are raising our full year ACV guidance to reflect the Q2 performance which exceeded our expectations, and our increased confidence in the full year pipeline. This raise was offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 30 million, which translates to an increase of 2.7 points of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance.  As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarterly growth can be variable. As we mentioned in May, ACV quarterly growth rates in 2021 will vary with Q2 and Q3 being the strongest two quarters. Based on our performance in Q2, we expect Q2 to have the highest ACV growth rate for the year.  As a reminder, we still expect Q4 growth to be muted given the Q4 2020 growth comparisons. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the fourth quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of 1,840 million to 1,890 million, which is growth of 8.5% to 11.5% or 7.3% to 10.2% in constant currency.  Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q2 revenue performance and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by a few million dollars of currency headwind. As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by 23 million, which translates to constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our May guidance.  As you know ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year revenue basis, revenue growth is less variable. In the second half of 2021, we expect revenue growth to be impacted by the year-over-year compare and mix of business.  We are increasing our full year EPS and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.85 to $7.15. This increase incorporates our strong Q2 performance and is offset by a few cents of currency headwinds. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of 495 million to 535 million. This increase is driven by stronger collections expected during the year, and continued improvement in payment terms toward pre-pandemic levels.  We are pleased with our strong first half in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, second half cash flow is most impacted by whether large Q4 deals close near the beginning or the end of the quarter.  For modeling purposes, we\u2019re expecting third quarter operating margin in the range of 34% to 36.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q3 and 2021 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their continued commitment to our customers and fellow colleagues during this prolonged time of uncertainty. The team delivered exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q2 financial performance.  The combination of best-in-class execution with a strong recurring business model and growing sales pipeline sets us up well to deliver on our 2021 outlook, as well as our longer-term financial objectives.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Yes, we were really pleased with not only the second quarter, but where we landed on the first half overall, as you know, translated to 16% growth overall for the half, which was fantastic. The team really delivered. I would say that it went back to a very similar pattern that we saw in Q1, which was it was broad-based across geographies and industries. As you recall, coming into the year, we were a little bit cautious about SMB and kind of the underlying momentum of SMB. And we had expected enterprise customers to perform as expected. I would say in the second quarter, we got a bit more out of the enterprise than we expected to get, which was great, because it showed people are really seriously committing to their R&D portfolios and accelerating development. But we saw, for the second quarter in a row, that resurgence on the SMB side, and there wasn't anything that was specific, localized or kind of in narrow form. It was just kind of everywhere. So I would say it's that really kind of broad-based performance that we saw really in the second quarter and the first half that contributed to the confidence that we had in raising our overall ACV for the year by the 2.7 points at constant currency. Yes. As I mentioned before, we were really pleased with the momentum we saw in the quarter and the strength we saw. What I would is, the guidance that we have going into -- the reason the full year was really not counting on SMB coming back to those pre-pandemic levels. There certainly is a lot more activity, there's a lot more engagement. But this does happen over time market by market. It does vary too, in terms of the rate and pace of speed of how these customers are coming back. And so, while I don't have a specific quantification to give you, what I would say is that if it happened at a more accelerated rate that's not -- and we were all of a sudden back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, that's not something we've really contemplated in our race. Sure. So let me break apart the components of cash flow. So as you point out, cash flow is more highly correlated to ACV because of the way 606 treats revenue recognition, so that is exactly the right way to look at it. So there's two components to it. There's the collections piece along the ACV side, and then there's the payment side. And so on the collection side, we have seen an improvement at a more accelerated rate, both in terms of lack of asking for extension on payment terms, people catching up on each payment, and people overall maintaining a level of current balance at higher rates than they had through the pandemic. So all of that is I think contributing to the acceleration on -- part of the acceleration on the cash flow side. The headwind in this particular quarter was really tax payments and the timing of tax payments, particularly in a quarter can have a more distorting dynamic overall. And so, as you recall, last year, there were some deferral incentives during the pandemic that raised cash flow in the second quarter, and then this year those payments were due as expected in the second quarter. And so, overall, I would expect to see still a little bit of capitulation and volatility in the relationship between the two, just because the nature of the payment piece is not kind of back to normalized levels. But what you can count on is that underneath the covers, the momentum around collections and customers\u2019 kind of behavior around that has been quite good. And we're really happy with where we're at. I think that we saw a very balanced growth and performance across the enterprise side and the SMB side. And so what we are seeing is that customers are using simulation to continue to accelerate their development roadmaps and the optimism around needing to make those investments overall. And so there was really no timing dynamic here of any meaningful -- to any meaningful degree other than the normal things that followed before and after the dateline in any normal quarter. It really is -- the performance in the quarter was really a statement of the overall momentum that we're seeing in customers\u2019 behavior overall. Yes. So we did see -- in the first half of the year, we did see relatively more professional license growth than we've seen in the past. And what I would say is that that long-term trend of shifting towards the lease model still continues, right. So as you recall, there were dynamics last year where perpetual was a little bit more muted. And I think what you're seeing this year is just some of the return of some of that business overall. But if you look at the business over longer periods of time, the growth and acceleration of the business is really driven by the lease model, and the perpetual business has been roughly flat over those longer periods of time. In terms of the second half, I think one of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 last year was not only exceeding the high end of guidance by $45 million, but there was a significant perpetual mix in Q4. And so how we're looking at it on a go-forward basis is not really expecting that repeat performance in Q4 overall. It is some of the underlying factors that are baked into the guidance. Yes. And, Jay, to your services question. So specifically, this year we really -- we do expect to see services disproportionately impacted by COVID, just because of the nature of services being more in-person, particularly with the Delta variant and some of the either self-imposed or imposed restrictions that customers are having around in-person engagement. So we're not anticipating in our guidance any increase -- any meaningful change in the trajectory of the services business. In terms of the skill sets that you're referring to, I\u2019d say that, yes, we are hiring, we are investing in the business, we're investing in the areas that you and Ajei just discussed now around helping our customers connect physics together with multi-physics. And so those are skill sets that we continue to invest in. And that services business is also -- that investment in the services business is also a reflection of the momentum we're seeing in the pipeline around sales, because those individuals also support selling process to some degree. So, overall, I think what you're seeing is a good set of momentum around customers starting -- continuing to accelerate their R&D pipelines and leveraging ANSYS to do so. And that's why we're making the investments in this space. Good morning. Yes. And I would add just one additional point to what Ajei said, which is the ANSYS team and the execution of that team. The sales team and services teams were there alongside customers throughout the pandemic. We've made investments in supporting our customers throughout that pandemic. And that puts us in a position of strength as customers are coming out of it and making the decisions that Ajei referred to. As you know, enterprise software sales cycles are long. So if you're not there and you're not committed to your customers and you're not delivering value even in times where they're not quite ready to invest at the levels that they're comfortable with in a time like the pandemic, it pays off in the end. And you can see that particularly in some of our markets like Asia Pac and other places where the team has just been exceptional in the way that they have managed and deepen those relationships with customers. Thank you. Yes. So at the beginning of the year, we talked about AGI contributing $80 million to this year. And so we're still seeing that as the current trajectory. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So, as you point out, the greatest return we've been able to provide on the deployment of excess cash has been utilizing it to acquire a second M&A. And the example of something like Phoenix is a great example of a premier technology which helps us accelerate. Another investment we made in December around in AGI. Phoenix provides model-based engineering. So I would say that you should expect that we will continue to execute strategy, which is consistent with our model, which is to achieve double digit growth with tuck-in acquisitions overall. So the decision on -- the capital allocation decision and the focus on M&A hasn't changed."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance; and Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President, Investor and Government Relations. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. DeBriyn for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our first quarter Form 10-Q, have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our first quarter financial results and business update as well as our Q2 and updated fiscal year 2021 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions.  Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Important factors that may affect our future results are discussed in our public filings with the SEC, all of which are available on our corporate website. We note that uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our performance could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections. Forward-looking statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information.  During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning's earnings release materials.  I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, Kelsey, and welcome to ANSYS, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I am excited to report that Q1 was an excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS. I'm also pleased that we are ahead of our internal plan for ACV. This is significant because, as I explained on our previous call, ACV is heavily loaded towards the back end of the year following the pattern of the past several years. And we are seeing the continued strengthening of the pipeline of ANSYS customer activities across all major geographies. The strong Q1 and our growing sales pipeline, coupled with our excellent Q4 last year, gives us increased confidence in the momentum of our business and in our ability to execute against our goals.  As a result, we are increasing our annual guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. We expect to see annual ACV growth, for example, to increase by over 1 percentage point in constant currency at the midpoint of our new guidance range. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes. In Q1, we were pleased to see that small and medium-sized customers who had slowed their purchasing decisions during the pandemic, showed stronger-than-expected sales growth across geographies and industries. Large customer behavior was as anticipated. From an industry perspective, our traditionally strong sector of hi-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation continue to be our largest contributors. Our largest deal in the quarter was a 5-year multimillion-dollar agreement with a large North American automotive OEM. This long-time customer is realizing savings by using ANSYS Simulation for its strategic warranty cost control initiative.  The manufacturer is also using ANSYS Simulation to identify the sources of electromagnetic noise to prevent interference and wireless communications. This new contract deepens and expands the customer's use of ANSYS solutions for wireless communications, autonomy, explicit dynamics, materials intelligence and electrification.  We saw numerous examples of simulation spurring product innovation and reducing development costs at our recently concluded Simulation World Virtual Conference. Nearly 40,000 engineers, designers, executives, students, investors and members of the press registered for this event, which showcased simulation success stories from a number of ANSYS customers, from small start-ups, to multinational organizations to span industries, including Northrop Grumman, Whirlpool, Medtronic, SC Microelectronics, Boeing and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Participants attended tracks on electrification, autonomy, digital transformation, 5G connectivity and digital mission engineering and listened to simulation use cases for vaccine distribution, spacecraft risk mitigation, crack propagation and gas turbines, virtual crash testing and automobiles and so on.  We heard from Formula One's Red Bull Racing, which is relied on the power of pervasive simulation to provide a competitive edge. Red Bull Racing's engineering team operates within a tight development window to optimize its racecar aerodynamics and shave milliseconds off lap times. With only a few days between competition, ANSYS Simulation becomes the team's virtual wind tunnel to run external aerodynamic analysis. Simulation is also key to developing the chassis control circuits, in selecting the right materials and in ensuring driver safety through virtual crash analysis. We had an entire track dedicated to electrification, where start-up Lucid Motors discussed taking advantage of simulation to develop its luxury electric automobile entirely on a computer, significantly reducing the need for physical prototypes.  Lucid achieved its goal of creating a battery that will run for 400 miles on a single charge while providing enough power to propel the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. In the process, the company addressed key customer needs, solved difficult engineering problems and brought a world-class vehicle to market in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches. Electrification, of course, is not limited to ground vehicles. Simulation-led breakthroughs in battery technologies are powering all-electric aircraft.  During Simulation World, we also heard from Air Race E, which is sponsoring a series of international racing competitions for electric aircraft. Air Race E teams are using ANSYS Simulation to develop batteries to deliver more power with less weight. And designing electric powertrains that overcome difficult thermal and high-voltage challenges. The lessons learned from these races could advance the development and adoption of electrification for commercial aircraft.  Nokia discussed its use of ANSYS HFSS and our electromagnetic solutions to investigate and optimize material properties and the performance of phased antenna arrays. By using ANSYS Simulation, Nokia was not only able to develop an alternative design that was fast, inexpensive and accurate, but also one that facilitates design sharing with vendors and mobile network operators. One of the most exciting presentations was from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, which highlighted simulation's role in the Mars Perseverance Rover mission. The JPL simulated every component of the landing, giving engineers confidence that the Rover would successfully endure the so-called 7 minutes of terror from atmospheric entry to landing.  Simulation was also used to ensure that the Mission Ingenuity Helicopter could navigate the thin Marsian atmosphere. Simulation World let me more confident than ever that the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation is working. With over 60 hours of content and more than 300 speakers from companies around the world, there are simply too many ANSYS customer success stories to mention on this call. So I encourage you to visit simulationworld.com to learn how ANSYS Simulation is changing the way these organizations are developing, testing and operating their next-generation products.  ANSYS partners were represented in Simulation World as well. Microsoft sponsored several sessions where they highlighted how users can leverage the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to gain easy access to high-performance computing resources directly from ANSYS products. Rockwell Automation discussed the key role that simulation plays in production, automation and digital transformation. In the PTC sessions, we learned how Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation are driving a key change in product development.  We also heard how ANSYS and Synopsys are bringing their integrated capabilities to cover a variety of multiphysics domain like power, timing, reliability and thermal simulation to maximize the speed and density achievable in advanced multi-die systems while ensuring robust reliability.  Turning to ESG. ANSYS recently published our annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights progress across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. On ansys.com, you can view the report and learn more about how those pillars are driving long-term growth for our stakeholders through responsible and sustainable business activities.  I'm also proud that Fast Company has named ANSYS to its list of the world's most innovative companies. ANSYS joins the prestigious list of organizations, including Microsoft, SpaceX, Sony and Honeywell. Fast Company has also recognized our digital twin at the human heart as one of its 2021 world-changing ideas. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS.  The energy and enthusiasm seen during Simulation World and the strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in the importance of simulation, in the effectiveness of our pervasive simulation strategy and in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q1 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, in Q1, our large customer behavior was as expected, and we were encouraged to see more momentum with our small and medium-sized customers. We're increasingly optimistic about SMB customer behavior for the full year based on the new deal activity we saw in Q1, which was broad-based across industries and geographies.  Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $319.4 million and grew 6% or 3% in constant currency, with strong performance from the channel and 78% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Q1 total non-GAAP revenue was $372.1 million and grew 20% or 17% in constant currency. We saw strong performance in lease revenue, driven by new leases signed in the first quarter. In addition, we had a higher mix of sales than expected from perpetual licenses, which drives more upfront revenue recognition.  The largest contribution to the growth in perpetual licenses came from Asia Pacific. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $936.5 million, representing a 12% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88.5% and an operating margin of 33.5%, which was better than our Q1 guidance. Operating margins were positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of expenses. The result was first quarter EPS of $1.12, which was also above our guidance. Similar to operating margins, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses.  Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19%, which is the tax rate that we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q1 totaled $171.1 million, which benefited from higher collections, given the strong Q4 finish in 2020. We ended the quarter with almost $1 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.  Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong financial performance in the first quarter and our pipeline while being mindful of regional uncertainties in a continuously evolving global pandemic environment. Let me also add that these increases to guidance occurred despite increased headwinds from currency exchange rates since initiating our full year guidance in February.  For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $415 million to $445 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.43 to $1.67. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook range to $1.760 billion to $1.825 billion. This represents growth of 9% to 13% or 7% to 11% in constant currency. The increase to full year ACV reflects our Q1 performance, which exceeded our expectations and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind.  As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $19 million, which translates to an increase of over 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarters can be variable. This year, quarterly ACV growth rates will vary based on how the pandemic impacted quarterly sales in 2020. Overall, we expect first half and second half ACV growth rates to be roughly similar to each other. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.810 billion to $1.875 billion, which is a growth of 7% to 11% or 5% to 9% in constant currency.  Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q1 revenue performance, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $24 million, which translates to a constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our February guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue is less variable. We expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half based on the mix of license types in our pipeline. Consistent with prior years, we expect the fourth quarter to be our largest revenue quarter in absolute dollars.  We are increasing our full year EPS outlook and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.69 to $7.10. This increase incorporates our strong Q1 performance and a favorable $0.14 gain on an investment that we expect to record in other income in the second quarter and is offset by approximately $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q1 EPS performance was driven by the timing of expenses that will occur in the remainder of the year as we redeploy spending to focused areas of investment.  Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $480 million to $520 million. This increase relates to payments we are no longer expecting to make, offset by approximately $5 million of foreign exchange headwind. We were pleased with our strong start to the year in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, we would expect cash flow to be skewed towards the fourth quarter based on the timing of large deals and whether they close in the beginning or the end of the quarter.  For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margin of 34.5% to 38%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and fiscal year '21 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q1 financial and operational results. Our incredible technology, talent and deep customer relationships drives our optimism in the long-term outlook for ANSYS. Our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2021 goals as well as our longer-term financial targets.  Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg.\nGal Munda: The first one, I was just like to double-click a little bit maybe on the linearity of the ACV growth that you're expecting for the year. Obviously, you have significant confidence in the rest of the year, hence raising it $19 million midpoint. But can you just talk a little bit about how those deals might come through? And if you have significant large deals in the pipeline that could affect that and that's why it gives you the most of the confidence?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So thanks for the question, Gal. Yes, we were really, really pleased with our Q1 performance and especially the green shoots that we started to see from the SMB segment, which was part of why we -- what led to our raise, as you noted, the $19 million raise in guidance. So I would say -- I would characterize our outlook to be consistent with what we saw in Q1, which was that large deal performance came in and enterprises came in as we expected them to behave. And we have some more growing optimism around the kind of improvement in the patterns of the smaller customer set, which, as you recall, was the customer set that we were a little bit more cautious about coming into the year.  And so I'd say the shape of the things that came out in Q1 are similar things that affect our outlook for the full year.\nGal Munda: That's really helpful. And then maybe the second question, a little bit more strategically thinking. You guys have been fairly successful in allocating CapEx over the last couple of years, really consolidated some of that market. You're returning to really strong cash position. Again, balance sheet is strong. How are you thinking about the opportunities at this stage kind of balancing your strong position with the multiples quite elevated? Do you have appetite to potentially add a little bit more to that organic growth with some opportunistic M&A?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is that our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. And as you point out, our greatest return typically comes from investing in the business and acquiring best-in-class simulation technology in support of our clients and the digital transformations that they're undertaking. So M&A is preferred, but we are selective. And so as a result, share repurchases and debt repayments are other areas that we've deployed cash, and we'll continue to do so.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Two questions. First, the company has previously said that your customer concentration, that is among your top 100 or so customers, has evolved from -- they are accounting for roughly 1/3 of your business to closer to now half of your business. And the question there is, how is that affected or might -- how it might continue to affect your internal investments, resource requirements, pipeline foreseeability, any of those sorts of metrics pursuant to that higher customer concentration?  And then secondly, there are a number of external and internal technology catalysts coming up, some of which were mentioned at Simulation World a couple of weeks ago. For instance, you have a new upcoming ANSYS Rockwell integration coming up. You have additional solvers for ANSYS Cloud coming up over the summer, I think, with the R2 release, plus some additional high core count configurations. Microsoft is going to be previewing manufacturing cloud. And then lastly, the materials business unit is going to be expanding, I think, more into the fluids area. So lots going on in the technology pipeline. Maybe you could talk about how any one of those are factored into your thinking?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So Jay, maybe I'll take the first question. I'm going to have Ajei take the second question. So as you point out, our strategy of pervasive simulation is playing out in the market and more and more customers are making larger and larger investments in there. And I think that it speaks to the strength of the strategy and the strength of the portfolio that customers are kind of going in going all-in on ANSYS to help them accelerate product development.  What I would say about the overall level of investment, I would say it's consistent with the strategy that we've had to be able to allow customers to evaluate, to leverage our technology using multiphysics solutions. And so that benefits our large customers, of course, but it benefits all customers. And I think that the momentum that we saw in SMB, as an example, is just one kind of proof point that would indicate that it's a purchase order.  So it's not as though we have a set of products and a set of investments that are for only large customers and only small customers, those investments get really diversified across the customer base. And so it's really about the personalization of the selling motion and how we engage with customers, which has been pretty consistent across the past couple of years. So I don't see anything that's any meaningfully different -- that would be any meaningfully different from an investment standpoint.\nAjei Gopal: And Jay, thanks for the question. So just to quickly jump in, this is Ajei. When you think about smaller versus larger customers, we have over 1,000 customers have gone through the ANSYS start-up program. And these companies tend to be some of the most innovative companies in their use of simulation and they push the envelope. Oftentimes because they approach the problem with no frequency of how to build a solution, and they're in a position to take advantage of the best technologies and the best solutions in the market, and of course, they turn to ANSYS. And so we have -- we are seeing the technologies that we are building and developing being used across the board by large companies as well as small companies.  And you alluded, and you mentioned several of these technologies. I think it's fair to say that the strategy that we laid out a few years ago, pervasive simulation is working. And if you recall, what we said there at the time was that we were going to diversify or focus from just focusing on the high-end analyst to with a broader set of individuals, so it's a broader engineering population so that we could address the needs of engineers across the entire product development life cycle.  And you talked about our relationship with Rockwell. That's a great example where we're trying to address the needs of the manufacturing engineer, for example. And in other areas with digital twin technologies, we can go after operations engineers and so on. So there's a very different -- it's a very different approach than we may have had 5 or 7 years ago. It's a much broader approach. And as you see, the technologies that we have developed, the acquisitions that we've made have all been in support of the core of the business as well as this diversification towards the pervasive simulation strategy, and it benefits both large companies as well as small companies.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: You mentioned that there was some sort of hiring that lagged in the quarter. What do you think about the sort of the broader job market? How do you think about your ability to hire people as a potential gating factor in 2021 as the economy continues to recover?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So thanks so much for your question. So in February, we spoke about more modest expectations for hiring in 2021, particularly in the first half. So in the second half of last year, we brought on about 300 new hires, plus we acquired AGI. And our focus -- employee experience is a very high priority for us at ANSYS. And given all of those people that we brought on board, our focus in -- at least in the first half of the year is really primarily to ensure all of them are properly onboarded, feeling engaged. And as all of us know, it's a little bit more challenging to do that during these times of COVID where we can't see each other.  So to date, we're a bit behind our objective, but that objective was a bit more modest. And so overall, we consider ourselves really on track, and we would expect to close the gap throughout the year. This is more of a matter of our own intentionality around our customer experience, and the competitiveness in the market and the ability to attract talent has not changed.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. If I could just add to that, I mean one of the things that we pride ourselves for is our -- is the culture within ANSYS. We see our employee engagement scores continue to go up and to the right, which I think is really important. We've won some Employer of Choice Awards, which I think is important as well. So all of that points to a great culture within the company. And given the technology and given the capabilities that we provide, frankly, for a number of students graduating from engineering school, what we do and the technologies that we provide represent their career objectives. They want to work in ANSYS. What we do is essentially what they've been training for as they've been getting their bachelor's degrees and their master's degrees or even their PhDs. And so we have that capability to attract, I think, top-quality talent into the organization, both from universities as well as from -- as well as people who are working at other organizations. So I'm very pleased about our ability to create that pipeline and also about the culture that we've been able to build at ANSYS.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up question for me. The semiconductor industry is clearly one of your areas of expertise and dominance. And we have several high-profile announcements on semiconductor CapEx shifting to the U.S. How much visibility do you have in your penetration here? And how should we think about sort of longer-term opportunity for ANSYS as incremental growth CapEx does start showing up in North America?\nAjei Gopal: Well, the way you should think about our technology is really helping our customers, primarily with the design of their products, whether it's semiconductors or frankly, with any product that they may be working with. And so as you start to look at investments, for example, in other geographies, for example, in the U.S., across the board, whether it's in semiconductors or elsewhere. And you start to look at the increase in capacity, that translates into the need for more simulation. And that translates into the need for more ANSYS. And because of the breadth of the portfolio because we have the ability to support multiphysics simulations, I think this puts us in a very, very good position.  If you look at our capabilities for advanced process nodes for semiconductors, if you look at the abilities -- capabilities that we have for 3D ICs, that's where, as I said, this multiphysics portfolio that we have really shines. And so we're in a position to support our customers as they evolve their plans and their design capabilities.\nOperator: And the next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe a first question, just thinking about and appreciate the color you provided thinking first half to second half. Just wanted to understand maybe the margin driver dynamics a little bit more, maybe particularly around either the SG&A line? And then just as a follow-up to that, great discussion earlier on the small and medium businesses. Was just curious if that's kind of the economy coming back? Or if you also have some targeted sales initiatives into those customers?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So thanks, John, for your question. So how I would think about margin overall is related to the skew of the business. So as we've communicated in the past, revenue is more highly skewed towards the fourth quarter and second half. Overall, first quarter tends to be kind of the smallest revenue generation quarter just based on the pattern of our customers' purchases and behavior. With that said, our overall business is -- the cost structure associated with our business is largely people, which is not variable. And so the margin profile as we go throughout the year is going to be much more elevated in the back half of the year and much more muted in the first half of the year.  And so we -- that's a normal pattern we saw -- we see it -- we saw it in 1Q. We've seen it in prior years. And so we would expect that pattern overall to follow suit.\nAjei Gopal: And then with respect to your comment about the small and medium business, as you recall, last year, when we talked about the impact of the pandemic, we pointed out that small and medium business was likely to be disproportionately affected. They typically don't have the financial resources that larger organizations do, and therefore, have to be a little bit more conservative with cash. Obviously, now we're in a situation where there is vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Obviously, we have tragic situations in parts of the globe, like, for example, the situation in India.  But at the same time, we have a broad-based perception that there's going to be a recovery around the world, and that translates into the economy coming back. So we certainly see that in general across the space and SMB is no exception. In many cases, the smaller customers are seeing the need to catch up with activities that they may have missed out on. And so there's perhaps an even greater emphasis on trying to drive some of this work.  The other point here is that we have global channel partners. And our channel partners oftentimes manage the relationships with the small and medium businesses. And so we have many, many arms and legs on the Street working with these smaller companies to help them get to the stage where they can get back into the main line of their operations. And so we're able to leverage this global channel network to also help us by being able to reach the small and medium business customers.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: First question for -- maybe for you, Ajei. Obviously, you talked about some large auto wins in the quarter, I think, one with a leading kind of EV company. Curious if that was kind of an expansion deal on an existing relationship. And if so, how much it expanded? And then more broadly, could you just kind of talk about your pipeline in the auto industry? I know this has been an area of strength and with a lot of the trends around autonomous and electrification, you've had a lot of success there. But are there large deals coming up for renewal? Maybe just give us a sense for how the automotive pipeline looks relative to years past?\nAjei Gopal: Sure. The customer that I referenced in the call was, in fact, a long time existing customer of ANSYS. And they obviously were in a position to renew some of their existing relationship of some of their existing product usage and expand in other areas. And so that was a good relationship, and that was important for us to be able to manage. They expanded, for example, into materials, that was a new area for us. And that came in, as you recall, through an acquisition that we did a few years ago, with Granta. What we're excited about in the broader automotive space is, I mean, you pointed to electrification, you pointed to autonomy. With electrification, clearly, the imperative seems to have continued to accelerate, and there is -- there continues to be activity, frankly, in all of the geos and through the supply chain.  The complexity of electrification, new government mandates to becoming carbon neutral, frankly, all of those things are driving a huge demand for simulation. And we're seeing a wide adoption of our electric machine design solutions as customers try to get to more reliable and efficient motors for electric vehicle powertrains. We're seeing battery and battery management system designs. Those are areas where simulation is growing as you have new regulations in place regarding things like thermal runaway, which is the major cause of fires in electric vehicles.  And then, of course, you see customers who are trying to focus on EMI and C testing, things like cable harnesses. So there's just a number of situations and examples of electrification, which represent, frankly, a significant level of investment across the board. And then, of course, with respect to autonomy, that continues to be an area of ongoing interest. And you see certainly a lot of customers participating in that space. I would argue that the market expectations of when we will have fully autonomous vehicles on the market has been pushed back because I think people are coming to terms with the complexity involved in creating a fully autonomous car on public streets. And so that's being pushed back.  But if you look at the work that we've been doing, we announced this partnership with BMW back in 2019. And over the last couple of years almost, we've had tremendous amount of positive customer feedback supporting our efforts. Earlier last year, we announced a partnership with FLIR that focused on hazard detection capabilities for autonomous driving. We've partnered with NVIDIA. We talked at the NVIDIA conferences where we've talked about our advanced radar capabilities. We've done some work with Velodyne on their LIDAR design.  So it's -- we have a comprehensive set of capabilities in a partnership strategy with autonomy. Most recently, you may have seen we announced a partnership with National Instruments, which was another important partner who's taken where we can work with our physics sensors. So we've got a partnership strategy with autonomy, which allows us to address the breadth and the complexity of that market as it develops as well. So I'm very excited about both of those markets. They represent tailwinds. And frankly, we were early to invest in that space because we saw those -- we saw both electrification and autonomy is being important, and I think our investments have been validated.\nTyler Radke: Great. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Nicole. You talked about the SMB segment improving, which is good to see. But in terms of impacted industries or impacted verticals, kind of where are we in terms of those improvements? Did you kind of see those perform above expectations in Q1? And just maybe help us understand when you expect those to normalize?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So what I would say about the SMB segment, in particular, is that it was broad-based. It was across geographies, industries, and so that was not industry specific. Overall, industry performance was in line with the expectations we had coming into the quarter. And any volatility in any given industry in a quarter is usually due to the timing of large deals or the timing of renewals. And so that could vary. So overall, the performance of the business in its entirety in the quarter was really in line with our expectations around large customers.  And as we had mentioned, what really exceeded our expectations and what was encouraging was just the broad kind of level of improvement that we saw in SMB overall.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird.\nJoseph Vruwink: Just to stick on the SMB performance in the quarter. I think at one point last year, you had revised your top line plans by about $80 million, and you said about 2/3 of that related to SMB accounts. I'm just wondering how much of that 2/3 of $80 million is maybe expected to now actually come back over the course of 2021? And then second question more on just the midterm performance of SMB customers. I'd say, the 1,000 customers that have gone through the ANSYS start-up program, what's been the experience of graduating onto kind of the upper tiers of the go-to-market period? And do you have any changes in ambitions for SMB within kind of the midterm horizon?\nAjei Gopal: So let me address the second part of the question first, as we think about the SMB program that we have or the start-up program that we have. So the ANSYS start-up program is really targeting companies that are very, very early in their life cycle. They may be pre-revenue, they may have very small amounts of revenue. And we work with them as they continue to develop their capabilities. And as I said, in many cases, we'll continue to push the envelope for simulation and what's possible. If -- I mentioned at Simulation World, there were -- we had a number of companies speak. You certainly heard from -- I mentioned Lucid Motors, that was an example of a company in our start-up program. Relativity, you may have heard me speak about them as well. Their business model is as a service. They're using our additive solutions and in our suite of technologies to be able to create satellites and launch vehicles for low earth orbit.  So very -- it's a very exciting group of companies. Obviously, small and medium business is not only related to the start-up program. We have others as well who are just smaller companies who participate in that program. Our expectation for the start-up program is that they continue to participate in -- they participate as part of members of the start-up program. And once their revenue reaches a certain level, they then graduate, if you will, into being mainline ANSYS customers.  And we've seen, obviously, as I mentioned, success, I mentioned a couple of anecdotes. I don't have the statistics in front of me, but we certainly can give you more information on that later.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So -- and on your question about the overall performance of the quarter, so look, we were really encouraged by what we saw. And I would characterize it as a beginning of a return to normalized patterns. This particular segment was very quick to shut things off when the pandemic hit. And they're going to be slower to return to normal as a result. They're just not as well capitalized as large companies. They're also more subject to any capitulation that continues to be in the market as the COVID pandemic kind of -- we get out of the pandemic. And so I would say our outlook includes a portion of that coming back. And it's really centered around -- we try to be transparent about what we see right -- what we see in front of us as opposed to speculate on how behavior can change. And so that's kind of how we've thought about the recovery in the context of our outlook.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Maybe just two quick ones. First, Ajei, just on the competitive landscape. Obviously, you've seen a lot of success, but some of your competitors are talking more about getting deeper into the simulation market. I love to hear a little bit on any changes competitively and what you're seeing there. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up for Nicole, more of a housekeeping. Can you just help remind us what the inorganic contribution was in the quarter for revenue and ACV? And what the expectations are for the '21 guidance?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. So I think ANSYS is a unique company. And we are, I would argue, unequal in the marketplace in terms of our expertise in physics-based simulation. We've got deep and lasting customer relationships. And frankly, that's allowed us to drive innovation across the portfolio, and it's allowed us to create a very efficient and sustainable business model and a very deep competitive mode. And that strength of the business model, it's no wonder that competitors want to try to enter the space because they see this as being an attractive model, perhaps more attractive than the markets in which they participate in.  And over the years, we've seen competitors try to enter the space with a point solution or two. And in the meantime, we've continued to expand our physics. We've achieved integrated multiphysics at scale. I mean, some of our most -- some of our solutions scale up to 200,000 cores, for example, in our CFD space, and that's just an enormous capability for our customers. And we continue to deepen and broaden our understanding of customer pain points. We've added new techniques to be able to solve them. We've -- and you see these advancements taking place across our entire portfolio.  So I'm very excited about our portfolio. I think we're laser-focused on customer success. We have a strategy that we're executing. This is the right strategy for us. By being able to broaden and deepen our capabilities in physics, we continue to support our customers from small to large across a number of different industries. And I think that puts us in a very good position competitively. And frankly, if there are any -- one of a smaller company gets acquired by another company, it fundamentally doesn't make any difference in our competitive dynamic as we see the market.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And Adam, just to answer your question quickly on inorganic contribution, our guidance hasn't changed from what we gave in February, which was the $75 million to $85 million contribution of AGI, is consistent with our outlook overall. The acquisition is going well, and we're tracking well against that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: First question is actually on the -- on kind of more near term in the automotive space. Appreciate that the largest deal in the quarter came from an auto OEM. But if we just think about maybe any potential for delays or spending patterns changing from the automotive sector, just with the chip shortage that's just right here in front of us the next few quarters?\nAjei Gopal: Jackson, as you know, our technology is tied to R&D initiatives. We're not tied to manufacturing or to a number of units that are being produced. And so what we are seeing is an ongoing continued interest in our customers to produce newer and better technology. As I've mentioned, and I talked about it at some length about electrification, I talked about autonomy. But these have implications not only for the OEMS but through the entire supply chain. The challenges of just getting electric cars to market, as I said, are quite significant. And again, that's where ANSYS comes in.  So in the design activity, in the R&D initiatives, that's where there continues to be significant levels of investment. And as I said, we're not tied to the number of units being produced. And so any shortage or challenge in being able to produce cars doesn't affect us from an economic perspective.\nJackson Ader: Okay. And then switching over to another industry. I'm just curious to hear what you're seeing in the commercial aerospace customer base and whether investments and budgets are growing and accompanying the growing vaccine rates.\nAjei Gopal: Well, as we talked about last year, and I think I gave on a couple of other previous earnings calls, I talked a little bit about some of the activity that we have in the commercial aerospace segment. And in particular, I talked about engine manufacturers and how we are working closely with them. Some of the challenges that they have, that they're dealing with are quite significant. When you think about an aircraft engine, it is a really sophisticated component -- it is a sophisticated machine and the tolerances are remarkably small. And so it requires the use of multiphysics simulation. It's a combination of fluids of structures, of thermal, all of those things come together to be able to solve these problems. And of course, our customers are now struggling with not just the traditional use cases, but next-generation use cases. For example, with eco-friendly and green initiatives, there is a significant amount of pressure on the commercial aerospace world to be able to come up with more efficient aircraft design.  I talked in the script about electric aircraft, but that's still some time away. And so certainly, that's a trend in the industry. But it's a -- but getting to these lighter weight, fuel-efficient, eco-friendly engines continues to be an initiative. What's important to realize is that aircraft programs, engine programs, for example, or aircraft programs, in general, are multiyear initiatives. These are not things that change on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So these are multiyear initiatives with significant amounts of R&D that stretches over a long period of time. And obviously, we're engaged with our customers and working with them to help them be successful.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ken Wong with Guggenheim.\nKen Wong: The first one for you, Ajei. With about 2% of your business coming from construction, I guess, it's not obvious that you guys might benefit meaningfully from an infrastructure bill? Are there other aspects of your business that would potentially see some sort of an uplift? And then for Nicole, just wondering in terms of a rebound in discretionary spend that might have been suppressed during the pandemic? With 5 months in the bag now, any change to how you're thinking about the pace or magnitude of that recovery and spend?\nAjei Gopal: Let me just take the first question. I think it's important to realize that when we are talking about infrastructure investment, certainly, we see the opportunity with heavy industries, construction equipment, manufacturing. So there are a number of industries for which we have -- where we have strong exposure, which we think will benefit from investment in infrastructure. And you're right, of course, about construction in and of itself, but it goes significantly beyond that.  And then even in the context of construction, as you start to look at next-generation techniques like digital twins and physics-based digital twins, we have technology and capability that would be relevant. So we are very excited about the infrastructure -- investments in infrastructure, we think that would benefit us and certainly the customers whom we serve.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And on your discretionary question, well, the vast majority of our employees are still working in a remote setting today. And we expect that's going to -- that they return to work. It's going to be really market dependent, and it's -- we're really focused on providing alternatives to employees, which ensures they're engaged and feeling secure about returning to work.  And so from an office standpoint, we've considered incremental investments to ensure safe return to work, although we consider that it's probably going to be slow. Travel is the one specific unknown to everyone. And what we would expect is that it would ramp more in the second half as markets become more open. But whether or not people continue to feel comfortable traveling during that time frame or not, that remains to be seen because we're not further enough along in the recovery.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Nicole, maybe first for you. Thanks for that tidbit on the inorganic contribution to ACV. Just maybe given the changing sort of FX backdrop and what sounds like certainly improved organic growth. I guess, the question is, how do you kind of think about organic constant currency growth in ACV for this year, just to sort of level set broad brush? Does that make sense?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean -- well, I would think about it in -- from the perspective of how we shared the AGI contribution. So the AGI contribution being $75 million to $85 million is kind of how we think about the inorganic portion of the business.\nSaket Kalia: Right. But then also sort of the changing FX. I know that there's an incremental $14 million FX headwind versus the guide that you gave last. But on a year-over-year basis, how is that sort of FX part of it kind of play into it as well?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So the year-to-year impact, overall -- let's go back to the overall guidance. So overall guidance, we've raised constant currency growth by a point -- by a little bit over a point at the midpoint, a little bit higher on the low end, right? And so how I would think about that raise is pretty consistent with the organic momentum in the business, given that our guidance around the inorganic component is remaining the same.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Got it. Got it. And then maybe the follow-up is just kind of given what you're seeing from the SMB base and just broader kind of recovery, it was nice to see perpetual actually kind of get back to maybe some more normalized levels that we've seen in the past. I know you called out APAC. So maybe the question is, is this perpetual performance maybe isolated to that region and to this quarter? Or do you sort of see perpetual kind of maybe starting to get back to sort of pre-pandemic levels?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So I mean, the -- there was -- Asia Pacific is a region that has a disproportionate percentage of customers who prefer the perpetual model, and that was a stronger performer in the quarter. And so there's a relationship between those 2 things. Overall, we feel that the long -- that over the long term, there will be a continued shift towards the leasing model. Customers have very dynamic development, R&D needs and project change and needs change over time. And so the leasing model provides customers with the level of flexibility to be able to use the capabilities that they need to as they need them over time and change those things over time.  And so overall, the long-term pattern and the momentum seems to be favoring more towards that more flexible model. And that's consistent with trends that are in the market today around customers wanting subscription licenses and more time-based licenses. So I would say there's nothing that we're seeing that is a sea change in preference. But in any given quarter, depending on the mix of customers, depending on the geographic region of customers, I wouldn't be surprised to see a dynamic like we saw in the quarter.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And then last question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: I'll just ask one. Maybe a follow-up to Saket's question. This is the highest perpetual growth quarter that we've seen maybe potentially ever. But was the strength in perpetual at all attributed to pull forward, which would explain maybe the growth rate? Just trying to understand the magnitude of the strength here.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. No, the perpetual growth in the quarter is really attributed to customers in the quarter disproportionately in the Asia Pacific region who chose to purchase -- they were in the pipeline and they chose to purchase in perpetual modes versus lease mode. So it really was about the in-quarter mix of pipeline and what resulted.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, operator. With our excellent start to the year, our strengthening customer pipeline and the importance of simulation to our customers, I am confident that we will meet our newly raised goals for 2021. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS for their commitment, their focus and their many successes. And I'd like to recognize the great contributions from our global channel partner network for their efforts in a difficult business environment.  And with that, thank you for attending today's call, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelsey, and welcome to ANSYS, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I am excited to report that Q1 was an excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we beat our financial guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS. I'm also pleased that we are ahead of our internal plan for ACV. This is significant because, as I explained on our previous call, ACV is heavily loaded towards the back end of the year following the pattern of the past several years. And we are seeing the continued strengthening of the pipeline of ANSYS customer activities across all major geographies. The strong Q1 and our growing sales pipeline, coupled with our excellent Q4 last year, gives us increased confidence in the momentum of our business and in our ability to execute against our goals.  As a result, we are increasing our annual guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. We expect to see annual ACV growth, for example, to increase by over 1 percentage point in constant currency at the midpoint of our new guidance range. Nicole will provide more details in just a few minutes. In Q1, we were pleased to see that small and medium-sized customers who had slowed their purchasing decisions during the pandemic, showed stronger-than-expected sales growth across geographies and industries. Large customer behavior was as anticipated. From an industry perspective, our traditionally strong sector of hi-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation continue to be our largest contributors. Our largest deal in the quarter was a 5-year multimillion-dollar agreement with a large North American automotive OEM. This long-time customer is realizing savings by using ANSYS Simulation for its strategic warranty cost control initiative.  The manufacturer is also using ANSYS Simulation to identify the sources of electromagnetic noise to prevent interference and wireless communications. This new contract deepens and expands the customer's use of ANSYS solutions for wireless communications, autonomy, explicit dynamics, materials intelligence and electrification.  We saw numerous examples of simulation spurring product innovation and reducing development costs at our recently concluded Simulation World Virtual Conference. Nearly 40,000 engineers, designers, executives, students, investors and members of the press registered for this event, which showcased simulation success stories from a number of ANSYS customers, from small start-ups, to multinational organizations to span industries, including Northrop Grumman, Whirlpool, Medtronic, SC Microelectronics, Boeing and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Participants attended tracks on electrification, autonomy, digital transformation, 5G connectivity and digital mission engineering and listened to simulation use cases for vaccine distribution, spacecraft risk mitigation, crack propagation and gas turbines, virtual crash testing and automobiles and so on.  We heard from Formula One's Red Bull Racing, which is relied on the power of pervasive simulation to provide a competitive edge. Red Bull Racing's engineering team operates within a tight development window to optimize its racecar aerodynamics and shave milliseconds off lap times. With only a few days between competition, ANSYS Simulation becomes the team's virtual wind tunnel to run external aerodynamic analysis. Simulation is also key to developing the chassis control circuits, in selecting the right materials and in ensuring driver safety through virtual crash analysis. We had an entire track dedicated to electrification, where start-up Lucid Motors discussed taking advantage of simulation to develop its luxury electric automobile entirely on a computer, significantly reducing the need for physical prototypes.  Lucid achieved its goal of creating a battery that will run for 400 miles on a single charge while providing enough power to propel the car from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.5 seconds. In the process, the company addressed key customer needs, solved difficult engineering problems and brought a world-class vehicle to market in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches. Electrification, of course, is not limited to ground vehicles. Simulation-led breakthroughs in battery technologies are powering all-electric aircraft.  During Simulation World, we also heard from Air Race E, which is sponsoring a series of international racing competitions for electric aircraft. Air Race E teams are using ANSYS Simulation to develop batteries to deliver more power with less weight. And designing electric powertrains that overcome difficult thermal and high-voltage challenges. The lessons learned from these races could advance the development and adoption of electrification for commercial aircraft.  Nokia discussed its use of ANSYS HFSS and our electromagnetic solutions to investigate and optimize material properties and the performance of phased antenna arrays. By using ANSYS Simulation, Nokia was not only able to develop an alternative design that was fast, inexpensive and accurate, but also one that facilitates design sharing with vendors and mobile network operators. One of the most exciting presentations was from NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, which highlighted simulation's role in the Mars Perseverance Rover mission. The JPL simulated every component of the landing, giving engineers confidence that the Rover would successfully endure the so-called 7 minutes of terror from atmospheric entry to landing.  Simulation was also used to ensure that the Mission Ingenuity Helicopter could navigate the thin Marsian atmosphere. Simulation World let me more confident than ever that the ANSYS strategy of pervasive simulation is working. With over 60 hours of content and more than 300 speakers from companies around the world, there are simply too many ANSYS customer success stories to mention on this call. So I encourage you to visit simulationworld.com to learn how ANSYS Simulation is changing the way these organizations are developing, testing and operating their next-generation products.  ANSYS partners were represented in Simulation World as well. Microsoft sponsored several sessions where they highlighted how users can leverage the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to gain easy access to high-performance computing resources directly from ANSYS products. Rockwell Automation discussed the key role that simulation plays in production, automation and digital transformation. In the PTC sessions, we learned how Creo Simulation Live and Creo ANSYS Simulation are driving a key change in product development.  We also heard how ANSYS and Synopsys are bringing their integrated capabilities to cover a variety of multiphysics domain like power, timing, reliability and thermal simulation to maximize the speed and density achievable in advanced multi-die systems while ensuring robust reliability.  Turning to ESG. ANSYS recently published our annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights progress across our environmental, social and governance initiatives. On ansys.com, you can view the report and learn more about how those pillars are driving long-term growth for our stakeholders through responsible and sustainable business activities.  I'm also proud that Fast Company has named ANSYS to its list of the world's most innovative companies. ANSYS joins the prestigious list of organizations, including Microsoft, SpaceX, Sony and Honeywell. Fast Company has also recognized our digital twin at the human heart as one of its 2021 world-changing ideas. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance for revenue, operating margin and EPS.  The energy and enthusiasm seen during Simulation World and the strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in the importance of simulation, in the effectiveness of our pervasive simulation strategy and in our ability to meet our newly increased outlook for 2021.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? And Jay, thanks for the question. So just to quickly jump in, this is Ajei. When you think about smaller versus larger customers, we have over 1,000 customers have gone through the ANSYS start-up program. And these companies tend to be some of the most innovative companies in their use of simulation and they push the envelope. Oftentimes because they approach the problem with no frequency of how to build a solution, and they're in a position to take advantage of the best technologies and the best solutions in the market, and of course, they turn to ANSYS. And so we have -- we are seeing the technologies that we are building and developing being used across the board by large companies as well as small companies.  And you alluded, and you mentioned several of these technologies. I think it's fair to say that the strategy that we laid out a few years ago, pervasive simulation is working. And if you recall, what we said there at the time was that we were going to diversify or focus from just focusing on the high-end analyst to with a broader set of individuals, so it's a broader engineering population so that we could address the needs of engineers across the entire product development life cycle.  And you talked about our relationship with Rockwell. That's a great example where we're trying to address the needs of the manufacturing engineer, for example. And in other areas with digital twin technologies, we can go after operations engineers and so on. So there's a very different -- it's a very different approach than we may have had 5 or 7 years ago. It's a much broader approach. And as you see, the technologies that we have developed, the acquisitions that we've made have all been in support of the core of the business as well as this diversification towards the pervasive simulation strategy, and it benefits both large companies as well as small companies. Yes. If I could just add to that, I mean one of the things that we pride ourselves for is our -- is the culture within ANSYS. We see our employee engagement scores continue to go up and to the right, which I think is really important. We've won some Employer of Choice Awards, which I think is important as well. So all of that points to a great culture within the company. And given the technology and given the capabilities that we provide, frankly, for a number of students graduating from engineering school, what we do and the technologies that we provide represent their career objectives. They want to work in ANSYS. What we do is essentially what they've been training for as they've been getting their bachelor's degrees and their master's degrees or even their PhDs. And so we have that capability to attract, I think, top-quality talent into the organization, both from universities as well as from -- as well as people who are working at other organizations. So I'm very pleased about our ability to create that pipeline and also about the culture that we've been able to build at ANSYS. Well, the way you should think about our technology is really helping our customers, primarily with the design of their products, whether it's semiconductors or frankly, with any product that they may be working with. And so as you start to look at investments, for example, in other geographies, for example, in the U.S., across the board, whether it's in semiconductors or elsewhere. And you start to look at the increase in capacity, that translates into the need for more simulation. And that translates into the need for more ANSYS. And because of the breadth of the portfolio because we have the ability to support multiphysics simulations, I think this puts us in a very, very good position.  If you look at our capabilities for advanced process nodes for semiconductors, if you look at the abilities -- capabilities that we have for 3D ICs, that's where, as I said, this multiphysics portfolio that we have really shines. And so we're in a position to support our customers as they evolve their plans and their design capabilities. And then with respect to your comment about the small and medium business, as you recall, last year, when we talked about the impact of the pandemic, we pointed out that small and medium business was likely to be disproportionately affected. They typically don't have the financial resources that larger organizations do, and therefore, have to be a little bit more conservative with cash. Obviously, now we're in a situation where there is vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Obviously, we have tragic situations in parts of the globe, like, for example, the situation in India.  But at the same time, we have a broad-based perception that there's going to be a recovery around the world, and that translates into the economy coming back. So we certainly see that in general across the space and SMB is no exception. In many cases, the smaller customers are seeing the need to catch up with activities that they may have missed out on. And so there's perhaps an even greater emphasis on trying to drive some of this work.  The other point here is that we have global channel partners. And our channel partners oftentimes manage the relationships with the small and medium businesses. And so we have many, many arms and legs on the Street working with these smaller companies to help them get to the stage where they can get back into the main line of their operations. And so we're able to leverage this global channel network to also help us by being able to reach the small and medium business customers. Sure. The customer that I referenced in the call was, in fact, a long time existing customer of ANSYS. And they obviously were in a position to renew some of their existing relationship of some of their existing product usage and expand in other areas. And so that was a good relationship, and that was important for us to be able to manage. They expanded, for example, into materials, that was a new area for us. And that came in, as you recall, through an acquisition that we did a few years ago, with Granta. What we're excited about in the broader automotive space is, I mean, you pointed to electrification, you pointed to autonomy. With electrification, clearly, the imperative seems to have continued to accelerate, and there is -- there continues to be activity, frankly, in all of the geos and through the supply chain.  The complexity of electrification, new government mandates to becoming carbon neutral, frankly, all of those things are driving a huge demand for simulation. And we're seeing a wide adoption of our electric machine design solutions as customers try to get to more reliable and efficient motors for electric vehicle powertrains. We're seeing battery and battery management system designs. Those are areas where simulation is growing as you have new regulations in place regarding things like thermal runaway, which is the major cause of fires in electric vehicles.  And then, of course, you see customers who are trying to focus on EMI and C testing, things like cable harnesses. So there's just a number of situations and examples of electrification, which represent, frankly, a significant level of investment across the board. And then, of course, with respect to autonomy, that continues to be an area of ongoing interest. And you see certainly a lot of customers participating in that space. I would argue that the market expectations of when we will have fully autonomous vehicles on the market has been pushed back because I think people are coming to terms with the complexity involved in creating a fully autonomous car on public streets. And so that's being pushed back.  But if you look at the work that we've been doing, we announced this partnership with BMW back in 2019. And over the last couple of years almost, we've had tremendous amount of positive customer feedback supporting our efforts. Earlier last year, we announced a partnership with FLIR that focused on hazard detection capabilities for autonomous driving. We've partnered with NVIDIA. We talked at the NVIDIA conferences where we've talked about our advanced radar capabilities. We've done some work with Velodyne on their LIDAR design.  So it's -- we have a comprehensive set of capabilities in a partnership strategy with autonomy. Most recently, you may have seen we announced a partnership with National Instruments, which was another important partner who's taken where we can work with our physics sensors. So we've got a partnership strategy with autonomy, which allows us to address the breadth and the complexity of that market as it develops as well. So I'm very excited about both of those markets. They represent tailwinds. And frankly, we were early to invest in that space because we saw those -- we saw both electrification and autonomy is being important, and I think our investments have been validated. So let me address the second part of the question first, as we think about the SMB program that we have or the start-up program that we have. So the ANSYS start-up program is really targeting companies that are very, very early in their life cycle. They may be pre-revenue, they may have very small amounts of revenue. And we work with them as they continue to develop their capabilities. And as I said, in many cases, we'll continue to push the envelope for simulation and what's possible. If -- I mentioned at Simulation World, there were -- we had a number of companies speak. You certainly heard from -- I mentioned Lucid Motors, that was an example of a company in our start-up program. Relativity, you may have heard me speak about them as well. Their business model is as a service. They're using our additive solutions and in our suite of technologies to be able to create satellites and launch vehicles for low earth orbit.  So very -- it's a very exciting group of companies. Obviously, small and medium business is not only related to the start-up program. We have others as well who are just smaller companies who participate in that program. Our expectation for the start-up program is that they continue to participate in -- they participate as part of members of the start-up program. And once their revenue reaches a certain level, they then graduate, if you will, into being mainline ANSYS customers.  And we've seen, obviously, as I mentioned, success, I mentioned a couple of anecdotes. I don't have the statistics in front of me, but we certainly can give you more information on that later. Yes. So I think ANSYS is a unique company. And we are, I would argue, unequal in the marketplace in terms of our expertise in physics-based simulation. We've got deep and lasting customer relationships. And frankly, that's allowed us to drive innovation across the portfolio, and it's allowed us to create a very efficient and sustainable business model and a very deep competitive mode. And that strength of the business model, it's no wonder that competitors want to try to enter the space because they see this as being an attractive model, perhaps more attractive than the markets in which they participate in.  And over the years, we've seen competitors try to enter the space with a point solution or two. And in the meantime, we've continued to expand our physics. We've achieved integrated multiphysics at scale. I mean, some of our most -- some of our solutions scale up to 200,000 cores, for example, in our CFD space, and that's just an enormous capability for our customers. And we continue to deepen and broaden our understanding of customer pain points. We've added new techniques to be able to solve them. We've -- and you see these advancements taking place across our entire portfolio.  So I'm very excited about our portfolio. I think we're laser-focused on customer success. We have a strategy that we're executing. This is the right strategy for us. By being able to broaden and deepen our capabilities in physics, we continue to support our customers from small to large across a number of different industries. And I think that puts us in a very good position competitively. And frankly, if there are any -- one of a smaller company gets acquired by another company, it fundamentally doesn't make any difference in our competitive dynamic as we see the market. Jackson, as you know, our technology is tied to R&D initiatives. We're not tied to manufacturing or to a number of units that are being produced. And so what we are seeing is an ongoing continued interest in our customers to produce newer and better technology. As I've mentioned, and I talked about it at some length about electrification, I talked about autonomy. But these have implications not only for the OEMS but through the entire supply chain. The challenges of just getting electric cars to market, as I said, are quite significant. And again, that's where ANSYS comes in.  So in the design activity, in the R&D initiatives, that's where there continues to be significant levels of investment. And as I said, we're not tied to the number of units being produced. And so any shortage or challenge in being able to produce cars doesn't affect us from an economic perspective. Well, as we talked about last year, and I think I gave on a couple of other previous earnings calls, I talked a little bit about some of the activity that we have in the commercial aerospace segment. And in particular, I talked about engine manufacturers and how we are working closely with them. Some of the challenges that they have, that they're dealing with are quite significant. When you think about an aircraft engine, it is a really sophisticated component -- it is a sophisticated machine and the tolerances are remarkably small. And so it requires the use of multiphysics simulation. It's a combination of fluids of structures, of thermal, all of those things come together to be able to solve these problems. And of course, our customers are now struggling with not just the traditional use cases, but next-generation use cases. For example, with eco-friendly and green initiatives, there is a significant amount of pressure on the commercial aerospace world to be able to come up with more efficient aircraft design.  I talked in the script about electric aircraft, but that's still some time away. And so certainly, that's a trend in the industry. But it's a -- but getting to these lighter weight, fuel-efficient, eco-friendly engines continues to be an initiative. What's important to realize is that aircraft programs, engine programs, for example, or aircraft programs, in general, are multiyear initiatives. These are not things that change on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So these are multiyear initiatives with significant amounts of R&D that stretches over a long period of time. And obviously, we're engaged with our customers and working with them to help them be successful. Let me just take the first question. I think it's important to realize that when we are talking about infrastructure investment, certainly, we see the opportunity with heavy industries, construction equipment, manufacturing. So there are a number of industries for which we have -- where we have strong exposure, which we think will benefit from investment in infrastructure. And you're right, of course, about construction in and of itself, but it goes significantly beyond that.  And then even in the context of construction, as you start to look at next-generation techniques like digital twins and physics-based digital twins, we have technology and capability that would be relevant. So we are very excited about the infrastructure -- investments in infrastructure, we think that would benefit us and certainly the customers whom we serve. Thank you, operator. With our excellent start to the year, our strengthening customer pipeline and the importance of simulation to our customers, I am confident that we will meet our newly raised goals for 2021. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS for their commitment, their focus and their many successes. And I'd like to recognize the great contributions from our global channel partner network for their efforts in a difficult business environment.  And with that, thank you for attending today's call, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide color around our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2021. Our strong Q1 results reflect outstanding execution across our business, which yielded revenue, operating margin and EPS all above our Q1 guidance. As Ajei mentioned, in Q1, our large customer behavior was as expected, and we were encouraged to see more momentum with our small and medium-sized customers. We're increasingly optimistic about SMB customer behavior for the full year based on the new deal activity we saw in Q1, which was broad-based across industries and geographies.  Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $319.4 million and grew 6% or 3% in constant currency, with strong performance from the channel and 78% of ACV coming from recurring sources. Q1 total non-GAAP revenue was $372.1 million and grew 20% or 17% in constant currency. We saw strong performance in lease revenue, driven by new leases signed in the first quarter. In addition, we had a higher mix of sales than expected from perpetual licenses, which drives more upfront revenue recognition.  The largest contribution to the growth in perpetual licenses came from Asia Pacific. We closed the quarter with a total balance of deferred revenue and backlog of $936.5 million, representing a 12% increase over last year's first quarter balance. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with fiscal discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 88.5% and an operating margin of 33.5%, which was better than our Q1 guidance. Operating margins were positively impacted by revenue performance above our guidance as well as the timing of expenses. The result was first quarter EPS of $1.12, which was also above our guidance. Similar to operating margins, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses.  Our effective tax rate in Q1 was 19%, which is the tax rate that we expect for the remainder of 2021. Our cash flow from operations in Q1 totaled $171.1 million, which benefited from higher collections, given the strong Q4 finish in 2020. We ended the quarter with almost $1 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.  Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We continue to build confidence in our outlook for the year. Coming off our strong finish in Q1, we are initiating guidance for Q2 and increasing our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook for the full year. This increase reflects the strong financial performance in the first quarter and our pipeline while being mindful of regional uncertainties in a continuously evolving global pandemic environment. Let me also add that these increases to guidance occurred despite increased headwinds from currency exchange rates since initiating our full year guidance in February.  For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP revenue in the range of $415 million to $445 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.43 to $1.67. As I mentioned, for the full year, we are raising our ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow outlook. We are increasing our full year ACV outlook range to $1.760 billion to $1.825 billion. This represents growth of 9% to 13% or 7% to 11% in constant currency. The increase to full year ACV reflects our Q1 performance, which exceeded our expectations and increased confidence in our full year pipeline, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind.  As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by $19 million, which translates to an increase of over 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. As a reminder, it is best to look at full year ACV growth as quarters can be variable. This year, quarterly ACV growth rates will vary based on how the pandemic impacted quarterly sales in 2020. Overall, we expect first half and second half ACV growth rates to be roughly similar to each other. Consistent with prior years, the dollar value of ACV will be highly skewed towards the second half of the year. We expect non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.810 billion to $1.875 billion, which is a growth of 7% to 11% or 5% to 9% in constant currency.  Similar to our ACV guidance, this increase reflects our strong Q1 revenue performance, offset by approximately $14 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, operationally, we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $24 million, which translates to a constant currency growth of 1.5 points higher than the midpoint of our February guidance. As you know, ASC 606 introduces revenue growth volatility within the quarters. However, on a full year basis, revenue is less variable. We expect revenue growth to be higher in the first half versus the second half based on the mix of license types in our pipeline. Consistent with prior years, we expect the fourth quarter to be our largest revenue quarter in absolute dollars.  We are increasing our full year EPS outlook and now expect EPS to be in the range of $6.69 to $7.10. This increase incorporates our strong Q1 performance and a favorable $0.14 gain on an investment that we expect to record in other income in the second quarter and is offset by approximately $0.06 of foreign exchange headwind. It is worth noting that some of our strong Q1 EPS performance was driven by the timing of expenses that will occur in the remainder of the year as we redeploy spending to focused areas of investment.  Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. We are increasing our 2021 outlook to a range of $480 million to $520 million. This increase relates to payments we are no longer expecting to make, offset by approximately $5 million of foreign exchange headwind. We were pleased with our strong start to the year in operating cash flow. But as a reminder, we would expect cash flow to be skewed towards the fourth quarter based on the timing of large deals and whether they close in the beginning or the end of the quarter.  For modeling purposes, we're expecting second quarter operating margin of 34.5% to 38%. And for the full year, we continue to expect operating margins of 40% to 41%. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for Q2 and fiscal year '21 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their exceptional execution during the quarter, which drove our strong Q1 financial and operational results. Our incredible technology, talent and deep customer relationships drives our optimism in the long-term outlook for ANSYS. Our focus on execution and investing in the business combined with the strength of our recurring business and growing sales pipeline provide a strong foundation to deliver on our 2021 goals as well as our longer-term financial targets.  Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions. Sure. So thanks for the question, Gal. Yes, we were really, really pleased with our Q1 performance and especially the green shoots that we started to see from the SMB segment, which was part of why we -- what led to our raise, as you noted, the $19 million raise in guidance. So I would say -- I would characterize our outlook to be consistent with what we saw in Q1, which was that large deal performance came in and enterprises came in as we expected them to behave. And we have some more growing optimism around the kind of improvement in the patterns of the smaller customer set, which, as you recall, was the customer set that we were a little bit more cautious about coming into the year.  And so I'd say the shape of the things that came out in Q1 are similar things that affect our outlook for the full year. Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is that our capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. And as you point out, our greatest return typically comes from investing in the business and acquiring best-in-class simulation technology in support of our clients and the digital transformations that they're undertaking. So M&A is preferred, but we are selective. And so as a result, share repurchases and debt repayments are other areas that we've deployed cash, and we'll continue to do so. Yes. So Jay, maybe I'll take the first question. I'm going to have Ajei take the second question. So as you point out, our strategy of pervasive simulation is playing out in the market and more and more customers are making larger and larger investments in there. And I think that it speaks to the strength of the strategy and the strength of the portfolio that customers are kind of going in going all-in on ANSYS to help them accelerate product development.  What I would say about the overall level of investment, I would say it's consistent with the strategy that we've had to be able to allow customers to evaluate, to leverage our technology using multiphysics solutions. And so that benefits our large customers, of course, but it benefits all customers. And I think that the momentum that we saw in SMB, as an example, is just one kind of proof point that would indicate that it's a purchase order.  So it's not as though we have a set of products and a set of investments that are for only large customers and only small customers, those investments get really diversified across the customer base. And so it's really about the personalization of the selling motion and how we engage with customers, which has been pretty consistent across the past couple of years. So I don't see anything that's any meaningfully different -- that would be any meaningfully different from an investment standpoint. Yes. So thanks so much for your question. So in February, we spoke about more modest expectations for hiring in 2021, particularly in the first half. So in the second half of last year, we brought on about 300 new hires, plus we acquired AGI. And our focus -- employee experience is a very high priority for us at ANSYS. And given all of those people that we brought on board, our focus in -- at least in the first half of the year is really primarily to ensure all of them are properly onboarded, feeling engaged. And as all of us know, it's a little bit more challenging to do that during these times of COVID where we can't see each other.  So to date, we're a bit behind our objective, but that objective was a bit more modest. And so overall, we consider ourselves really on track, and we would expect to close the gap throughout the year. This is more of a matter of our own intentionality around our customer experience, and the competitiveness in the market and the ability to attract talent has not changed. Yes. So thanks, John, for your question. So how I would think about margin overall is related to the skew of the business. So as we've communicated in the past, revenue is more highly skewed towards the fourth quarter and second half. Overall, first quarter tends to be kind of the smallest revenue generation quarter just based on the pattern of our customers' purchases and behavior. With that said, our overall business is -- the cost structure associated with our business is largely people, which is not variable. And so the margin profile as we go throughout the year is going to be much more elevated in the back half of the year and much more muted in the first half of the year.  And so we -- that's a normal pattern we saw -- we see it -- we saw it in 1Q. We've seen it in prior years. And so we would expect that pattern overall to follow suit. Yes. So what I would say about the SMB segment, in particular, is that it was broad-based. It was across geographies, industries, and so that was not industry specific. Overall, industry performance was in line with the expectations we had coming into the quarter. And any volatility in any given industry in a quarter is usually due to the timing of large deals or the timing of renewals. And so that could vary. So overall, the performance of the business in its entirety in the quarter was really in line with our expectations around large customers.  And as we had mentioned, what really exceeded our expectations and what was encouraging was just the broad kind of level of improvement that we saw in SMB overall. Yes. So -- and on your question about the overall performance of the quarter, so look, we were really encouraged by what we saw. And I would characterize it as a beginning of a return to normalized patterns. This particular segment was very quick to shut things off when the pandemic hit. And they're going to be slower to return to normal as a result. They're just not as well capitalized as large companies. They're also more subject to any capitulation that continues to be in the market as the COVID pandemic kind of -- we get out of the pandemic. And so I would say our outlook includes a portion of that coming back. And it's really centered around -- we try to be transparent about what we see right -- what we see in front of us as opposed to speculate on how behavior can change. And so that's kind of how we've thought about the recovery in the context of our outlook. Yes. And Adam, just to answer your question quickly on inorganic contribution, our guidance hasn't changed from what we gave in February, which was the $75 million to $85 million contribution of AGI, is consistent with our outlook overall. The acquisition is going well, and we're tracking well against that. Yes. And on your discretionary question, well, the vast majority of our employees are still working in a remote setting today. And we expect that's going to -- that they return to work. It's going to be really market dependent, and it's -- we're really focused on providing alternatives to employees, which ensures they're engaged and feeling secure about returning to work.  And so from an office standpoint, we've considered incremental investments to ensure safe return to work, although we consider that it's probably going to be slow. Travel is the one specific unknown to everyone. And what we would expect is that it would ramp more in the second half as markets become more open. But whether or not people continue to feel comfortable traveling during that time frame or not, that remains to be seen because we're not further enough along in the recovery. Yes. I mean -- well, I would think about it in -- from the perspective of how we shared the AGI contribution. So the AGI contribution being $75 million to $85 million is kind of how we think about the inorganic portion of the business. Yes. So the year-to-year impact, overall -- let's go back to the overall guidance. So overall guidance, we've raised constant currency growth by a point -- by a little bit over a point at the midpoint, a little bit higher on the low end, right? And so how I would think about that raise is pretty consistent with the organic momentum in the business, given that our guidance around the inorganic component is remaining the same. Yes. So I mean, the -- there was -- Asia Pacific is a region that has a disproportionate percentage of customers who prefer the perpetual model, and that was a stronger performer in the quarter. And so there's a relationship between those 2 things. Overall, we feel that the long -- that over the long term, there will be a continued shift towards the leasing model. Customers have very dynamic development, R&D needs and project change and needs change over time. And so the leasing model provides customers with the level of flexibility to be able to use the capabilities that they need to as they need them over time and change those things over time.  And so overall, the long-term pattern and the momentum seems to be favoring more towards that more flexible model. And that's consistent with trends that are in the market today around customers wanting subscription licenses and more time-based licenses. So I would say there's nothing that we're seeing that is a sea change in preference. But in any given quarter, depending on the mix of customers, depending on the geographic region of customers, I wouldn't be surprised to see a dynamic like we saw in the quarter. Yes. No, the perpetual growth in the quarter is really attributed to customers in the quarter disproportionately in the Asia Pacific region who chose to purchase -- they were in the pipeline and they chose to purchase in perpetual modes versus lease mode. So it really was about the in-quarter mix of pipeline and what resulted."

A discussion of the various items that are excluded and the reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS and the largest quarter in our history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including ACV, revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Q4 was the culmination of a strong year for ANSYS. Our industry-leading product portfolio, loyal customer base, strong execution and growing markets enabled us to beat and operationally raise our guidance each quarter of 2022.  This, of course, was despite the continued economic uncertainties brought on by trade sanctions and the war in Ukraine. We grew ACV at 14% in constant currency for the full year. And in the process, we achieved our goal of $2 billion of ACV in 2022. Thanks to this excellent performance, we realized our long-term financial goal set at our Investor Day in 2019. I want to congratulate the entire one ANSYS team, including our dedicated channel partners for the significant accomplishment. In a few minutes, Nicole will discuss our guidance for Q1 and the entire year. This guidance reflects the power of our world-class products, the ongoing demand from our customers and the strength of our business.  I am excited that our results from 2022 and as well as our guidance for 2023 keep us on track to achieving the long-term goals we set out in our investor update in August of 2022. Looking back at 2022, we saw broad-based growth across all major industries, geographies and go-to-market routes. Our direct and indirect channels grew at double digits. Similarly, each of our go-to-market customer segments, enterprise strategic and volume accounts also grew by double digits in constant currency. The Hi-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top contributors.  From a geographical perspective, we saw strong performances with each region growing ACV better than we expected. And I'm excited to announce that one of our regions, the Americas, recorded over $1 billion in ACV for the first time in our history. I'm also pleased with the performance of our product lines from a more established flagship solutions to our newest offerings. Our top 2 customer agreements for Q4 ACV or in the global high-tech and semiconductor vertical and totaled more than $125 million. Through these contracts, 1 for 3 years and 1 for 4 years, the customers are expanding their use of ANSYS technology into new business segments, which is driving more users, more products and more computations.  These customers have realized a number of benefits by using ANSYS solutions. These include identifying silicon issues during the tape-out sign-off phase, which has saved millions of dollars in respin as well as reducing multilayer PCB preprocessing time from a month to just hours. In Q4, we also signed a contract with NuScale Power, an energy company that is developing modular light water reactors to supply reliable and abundant carbon-free nuclear energy. Instead of relying on cost save physical prototypes, NuScale leverages ANSYS technology to simulate designs for containment, thermal hydraulics and the structural integrity of reactors.  ANSYS solutions play a key role in an extensive product development process that must navigate a strict nuclear approval process in which delays can cost up to $3 million per day. As you heard with this new scale example, structural analysis plays a key role in customer sustainability initiatives. Continuing with the theme of sustainability through our structured solutions I would like to highlight a few examples of how these structures products working in conjunction with the rest of the ANSYS portfolio address this important topic.  ANSYS, of course, was founded as a structured company. Over the last 50 years, we have continually invested to enhance our structure's offerings. The applications for structural simulation have evolved as even the simplest products have become more complicated and today's structure is critical for customers to meet their sustainability goals. Two additional Q4 sales agreements totaling nearly $60 million are driving sustainability in the energy sector. They are both anchored in structural simulation combined with other physics.  The first is with an energy company that is using ANSYS simulation to make its traditional gas and steam industrial turbines more efficient as well as developing blades and the cells for its wind turbines. The second agreement is to assist with the digital transformation of another energy industry leader. This organization is expanding its use of our solutions to include a variety of applications, including structural design, thermal stress, and electric motor design for its robotic arms. By using ANSYS technology, the company has helped to decrease its development costs by 20%. While materials is a newer ANSYS product offering, it works hand-in-hand with structures, particularly when it comes to meeting customers' sustainability goals.  That's because as customers seek to develop more sustainable products, they often consider nontraditional materials, which includes new steels, composites and short fiber reinforced plastics. Structural simulation on these new materials can assess performance to ensure safety and durability while also reducing weight and waste through topology optimization. ANSYS customer nature architects, one of over 1,700 members of our start-up program, is using ANSYS simulation to help its customers further their sustainability programs.  As companies look for more environmentally friendly materials for their products, many are turning to artificially designed metal materials to incorporate functions such as heat conduction, deformation and weight reduction. Using ANSYS for structural analysis and fluid structure interaction Nature's architectures implemented a scripting language that automates simulation tasks and streamlines workflows, which enables the team to visualize and explore new structures.  Our recent release of ANSYS 2023 are one is also helping customers with their sustainability initiatives. For example, ANSYS Granta Selector's enhanced Ecodata and Eco audit functionality helps engineers explore and rapidly iterate amongst design scenarios and material options. The tool empowers users to make sustainable materials straight off early in the product development process before high-fidelity structural analyses are performed and costs are locked in.  ANSYS solutions are not only helping customers to develop more sustainable products, but we are enabling them to do so in a more resource-friendly manner. One such capability is in our one is resource prediction which leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict how much time and memory will be required. Resource prediction will help guide users to achieve their business objectives for example, reducing salt time or decreasing energy consumption.  Another innovation in R1 is aimed at helping customers increase the safety of electric vehicles. As you know, EV fires caused by battery abuse or impacts can be catastrophic. This advanced capability anchored in our structures portfolio brings together multiple ANSYS physics to analyze this complex problem. Specifically, our new safety workflow in ANSYS LS Dyna simultaneously simulates the comprehensive structural electrochemical and thermal responses of batteries that are damaged in an accident or through some other event.  We are not aware of any other commercial solution with this critical functionality to help make electric vehicles safer. In addition to our organic development, we are furthering our structures product leadership through M&A, namely with our recent acquisitions of and Rocky. Dynamor was a longtime ANSYS partner and leader in developing and selling explicit simulation solutions with an emphasis in the automotive industry. develops dummy and human body models in addition to providing development expertise for [indiscernible].  This critical capability provides customers with complete software solutions for crash simulation, occupant safety and production processes. Our acquisition of Rocky solves a sophisticated customer challenge. Nearly 70% of industrial products experienced bulk granular material flows, where different sized particles with complex shapes interact, potentially impacting our product efficiency or structural integrity. Solving this difficult problem requires deep knowledge of both structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.  With the solution from longtime partner, fully integrated into the ANSYS portfolio, users can solve these complex design problems. As a result, our customers will be able to reduce waste improve product quality and predict the performance and durability of equipment. Thanks in part to our sustainability initiatives, Newsweek has named ANSYS to its list of America's most responsible companies for 2023. ANSYS was included in the annual ranking of the 500 most responsible companies based on environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives.  Our inclusion on this list demonstrates our commitment to making customers improve efficiency and reduce waste by minimizing the need for physical prototyping. Turning to partners. I'm excited that Autodesk Fusion 360 Signal Integrity extension powered by ANSYS was commercially released in November by embedding ANSYS' electromagnetic simulation capabilities within Autodesk Fusion 360 printed circuit board designers can access near real-time insights earlier in the design process for smart consumer products.  I'm also pleased that our electromagnetic and semiconductor solutions including ANSYS Redhawk-SC, ANSYS RaptorH and ANSYS HFSS have received GLOBALFOUNDRY certification for its flagship 22FDX platform. That certification enables trip designers to lower costs by reducing excess safety margins and improving system performance without compromising reliability or risking unexpected and damaging interactions amongst design elements. In summary, Q4 was an excellent quarter that kept a fantastic year for ANSYS.  We beat guidance across all key metrics and delivered the best year in company history. And of course, we exceeded our long-term goal of $2 billion in ACV. I am confident in our ability to achieve the goals we set during our most recent investor update in August. Despite some economic uncertainties, our end markets remain robust, and our business has proven its resilience over the years. Over the past few weeks, I've had the opportunity to speak with members of our direct sales team as well as several of our global channel partners.  Reporting strength in the market from the largest enterprises through SMB accounts. Given the importance of research and development, and innovation. The demand for ANSYS simulation continues to be strong because customers understand our compelling value proposition. And that is continuing to drive more users, more products and more computations throughout our customer base. Our momentum coming out of Q4, our strong customer relationships, our robust end markets and our leading product portfolio will propel us through 2023 and beyond.  As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve future milestones. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that 2022 was another outstanding year for ANSYS, and we're optimistic about our 2023 and our long-term outlook given the momentum in our business. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics.  This is particularly noteworthy given that we operationally raised our full year guidance across ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for all 3 quarters throughout the course of the year. Additionally, in 2022, we reached new company records across key financial metrics, including ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in the quarter and full year 2022 with growth seen across geographic regions, customer types and industries.  As a result of our broad-based performance, we achieved $2.032 billion in ACV in 2022, which surpasses the $2 billion commitment we made at our 2019 Investor Day. For additional context, when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates, full year 2022 ACV would equal approximately $2.113 billion, further demonstrating the magnitude and quality of our outperformance, which we delivered amidst a global pandemic and a challenging and volatile macro economic environment on. All accounts, 2022 was an outstanding year and we are entering 2023 with momentum and a strong backlog.  Now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and then I'll provide our outlook and key assumptions for 2023 and Q1. Beginning with ACV. We delivered $818 million in Q4 and which grew year-over-year, 8% or 13% in constant currency. For the full year, we recognized $2.32 billion in ACV, growing 9% or 14% in constant currency.  For the quarter and full year, performance was broad-based across customer types, geographies and industries. Our wide rate in growth is evidence of the essential nature of our market leading simulation portfolio and exceptional execution. For additional context, our full year ACV growth of 14% in constant currency came in 4 points higher relative to where we initially set guidance last February. Throughout the course of the year, we absorbed $82 million of nonoperational headwinds and including unprecedented U.S. dollar strengthening and the exit from business in Russia and Belarus, which was more than offset by $94 million of incremental operational momentum. ACV from recurring sources in 2022 grew 9% or 15% in constant currency year-over-year and represented 81% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription leases. For the full year 2022, ACV performance continues to be fueled by the strong growth in subscription leases which grew 18% or 24% in constant currency. Subscription lease ACV crossed over $1 billion to $1.2 billion or 57% of total ACV for the full year.  We continue to expect the growth of our subscription leases to be the underlying driver of the strong annuity that has been building over time and will continue to be a foundation for future growth. Q4 total revenue was $694.7 million and grew 5% or 10% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and was positively impacted by outperforming on ACV. Full year revenue was $2.073 billion and grew 7% or 13% in constant currency. We had strong top line performance in 2022 with ACV and revenue, both growing double digit in constant currency at 14% and 13%, respectively.  In both Q4 and the full year, we executed against our business model of double-digit. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of over $1.4 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid fourth quarter gross margin of 94% and an operating margin of 48% which was better than our guidance. We had full year gross margin of 91.8% and operating margin of 42%.  Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue. The result was fourth quarter EPS of $3.09, which was also better than our guidance. For the full year, EPS was $7.99. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was 18%. Our operating cash flows in the fourth quarter totaled $174 million which benefited from outperforming on ACV and strong collections.  Our unlevered operating cash flow was $181.1 million. For the full year, we had operating cash flow of $631 million, which grew 15%, meaningfully outpacing ACV growth despite significant foreign exchange and nonoperational headwinds. For modeling purposes, 2022 operating cash flow translates to unlevered operating cash flow of $648.1 million. For additional context, we absorbed $39 million of nonoperational headwinds since initiating 2022 operating cash flow guidance last February.  These headwinds, including the exit from this in Russia and Belarus and the adverse impact of foreign exchange were on top of the headwinds from R&E capitalization tax legislation and other law changes already factored into our February 2022 guidance. The $39 million of nonoperational headwinds was offset by $70 million of incremental operational performance throughout the year. The result was operating cash flow that was $31 million better than the midpoint of our February guidance.  This outperformance was driven by several factors, including outperforming on the ACV and margin expansion and the timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $614.6 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 225,000 shares during the quarter for around $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 725,000 shares for around $206 million which was 174% of the average capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchase over the past 3 years.  We have 1.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We delivered an outstanding Q4 and full year 2022 and we are entering 2023 with momentum and a robust pipeline and backlog, which gives us continued confidence in achieving the long-term outlook that we laid out at our 2022 investor update of 12% constant currency ACV compounded annual growth, inclusive of 1 to 2 points of tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flow from 2022 to 2025.  Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $2.265 billion to $2.335 billion, which represents growth of 11.5% to 14.9% or 9.9% to 13.4% in constant currency. We have a balanced and diversified business, which is driving the broad-based performance and double-digit ACV growth that we expect to see in 2023. Notably, the midpoint of our guidance is on our model of 12% constant currency compounded annual growth that we set at our investor update in August.  We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.242 billion to $2.322 billion, which is growth of 8.2% to 12% and or 6.9% to 10.8% in constant currency. Let me touch on some of the assumptions embedded in our full year guidance. We continue to expect broad-based growth and continued momentum from our large enterprise customers and SMB customers. We also continue to assume that our subscription leases grow faster than perpetual licenses and as a result, ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue as the business model shift towards subscription lease continues. Our full year guidance is based on how we see our book of business and pipeline today.  This brings me to our operating margin guidance. We expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.34 and to $8.86. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 17.5% and which is 0.5 point lower than the 18% rate we had in 2022. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance.  We are providing guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term $3 billion cumulative cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update in August. Our 2023 unlevered operating cash flow guidance is a range of $710 million to $760 million. We expect to see another year of significant growth in cash flow levels year-over-year. The implied unlevered operating cash flow growth of 10% to 17% for 2023 on top of the 16% unlevered operating cash flow growth we saw in 2022 exhibits the continued strong operating leverage in our business model.  Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow and the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now let me turn to the guidance for Q1. For the first quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $380 million to $400 million and revenue in the range of $482.5 million to $507.5 million. We expect Q1 operating margin in the range of 35.3% to 37.3% and EPS in the range of $1.53 to $1.71. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q1 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for a fantastic quarter rounding out another exceptionally strong year. Our performance is evidence of the critical nature of our market-leading simulation portfolio as well as the team's operational discipline and focus on customer excellence. Our consistent performance and execution enabled us to deliver above and beyond our 2019 Investor Day and 2022 annual commitments despite a continued challenging and volatile macro environment.  Our core simulation market is strong and growing, and we are excited about the immense opportunity that lies ahead as we continue to help our customers solve their most complex product development challenges. We are entering 2023 with considerable momentum, a resilient and diversified business model with 3 vectors of growth and a healthy backlog and pipeline. All of which fuels the optimism embedded in our full year and long-term outlook.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Ken Wong of Oppenheimer.\nKen Wong: Fantastic and fantastic quarter from you guys. Ajei, I wanted to just maybe touch on some of the strength I noticed one segment that really stood out to me was the aerospace and defense from a rev mix perspective, it jumped up. You talked up 7-, 8-figure deals can you maybe highlight some of the underlying drivers there? And as we look out to '23 and beyond, is there still decent runway for those particular growth tailwinds in that particular vertical?\nAjei Gopal: Sure. Ken. So let me briefly talk about aerospace. Our aerospace customers are facing relatively complex challenges, and it's pretty broad-based. And so when you think about some of our business -- we have customers who are focusing on aircraft engines. And obviously, there are a number of trends in that space, whether it comes to lightweighting and energy efficiency, in some cases, electric engines, different fuel sources, so there's a number of different levels of innovation taking place at various points in the AMB aerospace industry. Obviously, in the Space 2.0 world, there are -- there continues to be a lot of innovation and both in larger companies as well as smaller companies.  And then, of course, you've seen some of the work that we've done with significant projects like the web telescope and the dark mission where our project where our technologies were used in the development of those projects. So there's a lot of different activity across the space in this entire aerospace and defense world for us. And I believe that the demand for our offerings continues to be robust, and we see a pipeline in that space as well.\nKen Wong: Great. And then a follow-up for you, Nicole. Just wanted to touch on the unlevered operating cash flow guide. I mean, look, it's a fantastic number of building off of a really strong '22. I guess as we think about the long-term targets I think there was sort of an underlying assumption that there would be expansion. I guess my calculation suggests it's kind of closer to, I think, it looks like 32% off of a 32% number. Is it just you guys see a little more room for growth this year and we should still assume long term that, that number does continue to expand. Just some puts and takes there would be fantastic.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. Well, thanks, Ken. And yes, we were really, really pleased with the exceptional close of our cash flow performance at the end of the year, as you point out, it grew quite substantially delevered operating cash flow in 2022 in our outlook range of 10% to 17% unlevered operating cash flow indicates continued momentum in the business overall.  As you know, I mean, we gave long-term guidance in August. We're not prepared to update the long-term guidance. But when you look at the combined -- the 2-year growth rate of 2022 and 2023 from the ECB perspective, and the comparative unlevered operating cash flow growth rate over that period, you could see the substantial operating leverage and margin expansion associated with that it's a little early for us to update long-term guidance we just gave it 6 months ago. But what I can say is -- and there's a lot of exogenous factors that impacted unlevered operating cash flow number as you know, foreign exchange had a pretty meaningful impact to that last year.  As an example, we're still not quite out of the woods as it relates to that so not really prepared to give anything longer term than 2023 today, but we feel really good about the underlying strength of the operational momentum of the business. We have a very disciplined investment model around putting investment in, that drives incremental growth. And those are things that we -- that we expect to be able to continue to build on over the next couple of years.\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Vruwink of Baird.\nJoseph Vruwink: Great. ACV in an organic basis seems to be growing, I think, several hundred basis points above the framework that was provided last year. I guess my question is, within that 2022 to '25 time line, were the years 2022 and 2023 always intended to be this way, just given, I don't know, pricing or renewals or the shift to leases? And if that's not the case, maybe you can just walk through some of the upside drivers the last year and then in terms of your outlook for this year?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, sure. So maybe just kind of level set on what the makeup of 2022 was in 2023, we can talk about the long term. So as we previously mentioned, the inorganic contribution from ZMAX last year, we had said it was about $20 million. And that, as you point out, contributed around a point of growth to the overall performance last year. As we look into 2023, we completed 2 acquisitions at the end of the quarter after our earnings announcement. were the most notable were 2 that completed at that time. Just some context of those is a product we were the primary reseller for already.  And it's also a pretty small product line so it doesn't have a very material run rate to the business. And although we already had a relationship with we expect the inorganic contribution from that transaction to be around EUR 30 million to EUR 35 million of ACV in revenue. So with just under half of that in Q1. So there's a pretty different SKUs to that business relative to ours. So that would put us around the 10% constant currency growth in ACV when you exclude Dyna more our full year outlook which is on our business model of double-digit growth, including ACV.  As it relates to the long-term view of ACV and how we see it, I mean, we there isn't a perspective in particular around what happened in 2022 and how that would change the outlook in the future are out, we still remain confident in the 12% compounded annual growth rate through the course of that time. And certainly, as trends in the business change and the underlying -- anything that foundationally would shift that growth objective, we would certainly update our long-term guidance at that time.  But right now, we're really pleased with what we delivered in 2022 and we're building -- we have a really strong outlook for 2023 on top of a really strong performance in 2022, and we're really pleased to continue to be on that model that we set out in.\nJoseph Vruwink: Okay. Great. was a bit bigger now. I was thinking. So that's all helpful. And then there was an interesting comment on just performance across your different customer segments. I guess, I'll ask, are there any, I guess, noticeable changes in spending patterns when you think inside your top 100 and outside? And I guess, at the heart of this question, is the strong pace of the outlook for 1Q. Typically, I think about that being outside the big year-end enterprise activity. And so is this indicating maybe strength that is more broad across the customer base at the start of the year?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean as we said in our prepared remarks, and I think we've said that throughout last year, the underlying drivers of growth in 2022 was very broad-based across customer geographies industries and the outlook considers very similar broad-based. There's no individual customer concentration. There is one element to Q1 guidance, and I had think I briefly mentioned this in the first part of my answer to you on M&A -- on the M&A impact. does have a slightly different SKUs to their business. There's just under half of the business that actually happens -- and so a little bit more than half -- a little bit less than -- or bit less than half of the business in Q1. So there is a little bit of a dynamic around Dynamar that is earlier on in the year relative to the future periods in the year that we have a slightly different pattern than maybe some of the more kind of smaller impacts on a quarterly basis that you see of some of the other M&A that we've done in the past.\nOperator: The next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Let me ask your question that we've been posing to your CEO peers at the other companies in the group. And that is in the context of what you've defined as a dozen elements of your long-term technology strategy when you think about 2023 spending priorities and beyond, what are -- in terms of your R&D, the most incremental or newest priorities over and above your base investments in solvers and not the solvers.  What would you say are some of your most important or newer executables as far as R&D are concerned, and then second question, at the Analyst Meeting 6 months ago, you spoke of a variety of growth vectors, among which you described the traditional use cases and new use cases when you think about '23 guidance, is there any way you could relate the way you thought about those growth vectors to '23 guidance in terms of the traditional use cases and new or which you also referred to as connected and integrated workflows. Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: So Jay, so firstly, when you think about our technical priorities will be areas that we're making investments in our business, I would say that probably 5 broad areas where we're making technological investments. The first I would broadly categorize as numerics and that includes physics models and methods for both the physics and multiphysics. That's just the core physics part of what we do. The second area is in AI machine learning where we're making significant investments across the portfolio.  Our customers today are seeing the benefits of ANSYS products that have been enhanced through AI. We've, of course, filed patents to cover some of our work in the space, and we continue to make significant investments in AI and getting our customers to be able to take advantage of this great technology in the context of our offerings. The third area is high-performance computing. That obviously includes -- that obviously includes both HBC as well as CPUs, GPUs and so for example, if you look at R1, we just announced some really exciting work on [indiscernible] for example, our optical solver where we can show that a single GPU is something like 8x faster than the 32 core CPU machine.  And then, of course, we're very excited about a fluent multi-GPU solver which allows fluid simulations to run natively on multiple GPUs, and that is a game changer in terms of performance, and we can show tremendous orders of magnitude scale up and in terms of both performance as well as, of course, cost savings when it comes to things like energy usage and others. So we are very excited about the work that we've done in the GPU space, and we continue to make investments over there.  Cloud and experience is the fourth area. That includes the work that we're doing in cloud. You may have seen some recent announcements where we're -- we've announced some of our cloud technology in the context of our cloud marketplace offerings, and we continue to invest in cloud native capabilities as well as user experience. And the last area is in digital engineering, and that includes things like digital twins, mission, system simulation and there, we continue to make advances.  And you saw, obviously, some of the capabilities of our product lines on the space. Unintended when you -- when we talked about James Webb as well as the dark mission, but certainly, we have ongoing investments in that space as well, and that includes things like NBFC. So broadly, there are 5 areas: numerics, AI, ML, high-performance computing, cloud and experience and digital engineering and these are the areas that are driving our next-generation activities.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And Jay, to answer your question on kind of connection to customer demand, I think the way that you could think about it, if you look at these if you kind of refer to the trends that Ajei just referred to as well as the underlying kind of performance in our industry mix. I mean much of what's driving that demand are the complex multi-business use cases and the trends that are driving investment in those areas, right? So we talked about double-digit growth -- double-digit growth in automotive in Q4 as an example, and the things that are driving those trends are really around the next generation of vehicles and technology that are connected to things like electrification, sustainability, those types of things.  As you know, those are not a single component level. Single [indiscernible] problem, which are falling to that traditional use case, they are complex multiphysics forms that involve both component level all the way to the system and systems of system level particularly in cases like space 2.0 alerting. And so what we are seeing is more and more of that strategic selling motion becoming the main focus of -- or the main motion of how we engage our customers and be solving those higher order complex problems, which makes us a very important partner regardless of what kind of economic times, people may be having -- we help sell those very difficult problems known can help sell.\nOperator: Next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Just a question on the kind of the cadence of the guide. I think you mentioned the acquisition influence on the 1Q. It seems like the 1Q is pretty strong from a margin and revenue growth perspective. And then Matt, if you just kind of back out the next 3 quarters, it's slower and margins, I think, are down year-over-year. Maybe I'm doing the calc wrong. Can you just talk about a bit of what's going on there?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So first, one of the aspects to the business since the accounting change for the 606 accounting change several years back. is that the dynamics around revenue recognition creates a lot of volatility in the P&L and particularly on a quarterly basis. And that's because the difference in the underlying mix of licenses on a year-over-year basis can significantly influence the dynamics around revenue recognition. And so the margins the kind of pattern throughout the year is a little less meaningful in kind of extrapolating kind of where directional momentum is going particularly in the P&L. We do also have similar variability in quarters as customers have moved to multiyear leases -- it is not as much of a selling motion where it's only about an event at a point in time that kind of comes up once a year, there's an ongoing selling process that happens kind of throughout the year where ACV can be remixed relative for a single customer relative to what the prior year looks like.  So there's considerable volatility that happened throughout the quarters. And that's why we're really focused on being really clear about our full year guidance where our full year outlook is for ACV and operating cash flow and particularly in particular, in the P&L overall. And the way that we feel we're indicating kind of the change in the trajectory of the business is with our updates to the full year guidance. And so that's how that's how we would think about it overall is really around that. And I think you could see that in kind of how we went through our guidance last year.  And if we could look at the beginning of the year, there was a 4-point difference in ACV as an example, as we progressed throughout the year. And that's because our philosophy is that we look -- we give guidance based on what we see ahead of us today and what the pipeline in the book of business looks like today. And as things change, up or down, we will be clear about what changes. We don't try to create wide ranges, which predict macro trends or things that we can't control. We try to look at it in terms of where our book of business is today. So does that answer your question?\nSteve Tusa: Yes, that's helpful. I guess you were pretty clear in mentioning that you're seeing strength across large enterprises as well as small and medium-sized businesses, which is clearly different than what some other obviously not simulation companies, but more of the PLM and CAD guys are saying. So I just wanted to make sure there was nothing in that guidance that was contrary to that comment where it seems like the strength is broad-based and really not slowing. So the guidance is really not meant to reflect that kind of macro outlook.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, absolutely. I mean it is the variability within the timing of things in the quarters can create some ups and downs throughout the year. But the overall outlook, which we think is quite strong out of the gate is really a reflection of broad-based demand, as you point out.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Just one more on 1Q. Any color on cash flow for 1Q.\nNicole Anasenes: Cash flow, so we do not give quarterly cash flow guidance because the dynamics around cash flow within a quarter because change because of timing of payments that fall over date lines -- or timing of collections that could sell over datelines quite easily and make really meaningful differences. But for modeling purposes, I think you can assume that a meaningful portion of the cash flow occurs in Q1, particularly off of a strong Q4.  And Q1 and Q4 tend to be the largest cash flow quarters. The middle 2 quarters tend to be a little bit more muted with Q2 being probably the lower water mark.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: And well done on a strong finish to -- thank you Nicole, maybe for you, very helpful on the ACV contribution from inorganic. I was wondering if you could just talk about that from just a margin and free cash flow perspective. And just to preface it a little bit, I mean, ANSYS is, of course, so profitable. It's rare that a tuck-in acquisition is accretive to margins. But can you just maybe just give us some broad brushes on operating margins, that is.  Can you just give us some broad brushes on how and and maybe any of the other kind of acquisitions for mid-'22 are impacting that margin here in '23? And whether those acquisitions are maybe additive or dilutive to operating cash flow?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. Thanks, Saket. So as you point out, in almost every acquisition we do is dilutive to actual margin. So there is no accretion for margin that occurs with some or any individual acquisition we have. Now as it relates to cash flow, Cash flow is also relatively more muted in the first year. I mean, sometimes you can have some slight positive impacts cash flow. But as you know, there's meaningful year one expenses associated with integration and those types of things, which are normal operating cash outflows. And so as it relates to the most significant kind of individual contributor to the overall portfolio would be the example. That did have some contribution to the underlying cash flow guide, but it's really modest relative to what it might be on an ongoing basis.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. Ajei, maybe for my follow-up for you. You touched on this in the question just around R&D priorities with some of the public cloud announcements, which I thought were very notable this quarter with both AWS and Azure. Maybe just a higher-level question. How do you sort of think about the mix of simulation being done on public cloud hyperscalers versus more traditional on-premise or private cloud simulation being done within your customer base -- and how do you sort of see that mix shifting? How -- does that make sense?\nAjei Gopal: Yes, it does. Thank you for the question. Look, the way you should think about it is, from an ANSYS perspective, we're really agnostic as to where someone might be able to run our solutions. I mean we want -- I mean, one of the primary uses of cloud today is for high-performance computing applications. And so we know that we have customers who are taking advantage of the licenses that we make available to them and they're using them in the public cloud. And really, from our perspective, we want people to have the flexibility to be able to use to be whatever environment where they have compute available. Obviously, as time goes on, there is a clear trend even in the largest organizations, which have invested in data centers there is a clear trend towards taking advantage of public cloud.  And obviously, as the public cloud vendors are continuing to invest in scientific computing capabilities, where the nodes that are available have the requisite needs for scientific computing, that's also driving incremental usage. So it is clearly an ongoing it is clearly an ongoing direction and something that we expect to see happen. From our strategy, I mean, look, we are very excited about the public cloud being used from our strategy perspective, we have, as you know, 2 distinct kinds of cloud offerings, what we call cloud marketplace and what we call cloud native and this combination of marketplace and native takes full advantage of everything that we previously talked about as well as some of the newly developed and announced cloud capabilities.  The marketplace offerings are really about delivering flexibility to our existing customer base. So it's really giving customers, as I said earlier, giving them the option to maintain the same patterns that they employ today, taking advantage of familiar ANSYS products while leveraging the benefit of cloud computing and their own pre-existing relationships with cloud service providers. And so you mentioned the ANSYS Gateway with AWS, which we released in Q4 of last year. You talked about the announcement we made in February of this year where we extended our Microsoft partnership in the Agile marketplace offering. So there's a number of activities in that space.  On the cloud native space, we're targeting new users and new use cases, and that's really a cloud-based platform for the development and deployment of new workflows and applications. And as if you remember back at our Investor Day, we talked about a new area of verticalized simulation applications where the power of simulation gets extended far beyond its current user base to, frankly, anyone who needs predictive analytics.  And so we have initiatives and R&D efforts underway in that space. And it's still very early days, but you should stay tuned for more progress as we continue to move this exciting technology for the rollout.\nOperator: The next question is from Tyler Radke of Citi.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Some really impressive results in Germany and Japan this quarter, and I think you talked about some big wins with the automakers. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of that outperformance in the quarter? And in these large deals with the automakers, like what exactly is driving the large expansions and maybe go into some detail in terms of the higher simulation core count that you're seeing in electronic motor design. And if you could just elaborate on some of the trends driving that?\nAjei Gopal: Sure. I mean, look, the automotive business is one of our top 3 industries, as you know, top 3 verticals as we define it, growth high tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation. And it continues to be a strong area. And we've got deep relationships with our automotive customers as they continue to face these complex challenges with their products. And there's a number of things -- there's a number of areas where they're continuing to innovate. Firstly, obviously, if you think about passenger cars for a moment, there is clearly a direction towards fuel efficiency and so on in more traditional cars in the traditional internal combustion engine and that deals with lightweighting, et cetera, crash testing, those are across all of the product lines.  But as you start to think about the next-generation electrification alternative energies, those are all important themes where customers are investing and making investments for the long term. Battery technology. And I hope me mention an example of some of the work that we're doing there with impact analysis with the -- in my script earlier. So there's a lot of work in multiple areas taking place that are supporting the automotive customers I would just point out, by the way, that as we think about the work that takes place, for example, with electrification in the automotive industry, the work that leads to that includes the entire supply chain and then may be suppliers who are in our high-tech vertical or building very high-tech components that are then being used in the automotive space.  And so if you start to look at the entire supply chain, the impact of automotive is very large across the industry as they're looking at all of these different areas. Now the breadth of our technology and the breadth of the portfolio I mean it's so large that we are able to help our customers as they are looking at all of these different issues. Sustainability is another example. And that's why I think you're seeing strength in these industries, the sophisticated industries, which require these -- which are going through these transformations, we are able to help our customers navigate through these next-generation [indiscernible] that they're facing or trends of the dealing with the market.\nTyler Radke: And a follow-up for Nicole. Obviously, the profitability performance in the quarter and outlook was pretty strong. I'm wondering if there's any cost savings or OpEx specific initiatives that you're undertaking or if this is just a result of the top line outperformance. But if you could just -- obviously, a lot of companies out there taking a look at the processes and people certainly, you're not facing the level of growth challenges.  There's a lot of other software companies. But just curious if there's any incremental initiatives on the cost side that you're pursuing here.\nNicole Anasenes: Thanks, Tyler. So what I would say is, yes, that the operating -- we have very strong operating leverage in the business because we have relatively low variable costs and so that's why you can definitely see as we continue to accelerate growth, the operating leverage in the business. Now it comes down to what do you do with that incremental growth? And how do you reinvest it and I would say that we have a tremendous amount of operational discipline around decision-making around investments that is not new to ANSYS. It is kind of embedded in how we make decisions and how we prioritize where we put investments with an eye towards how do we get return with a balance on what is helping us for the short term and how are we making sure that we're prudently investing for the long term.  And so that strategy has served us well. It has allowed us to continue to invest in the business as things -- as things are good and make sure we can accelerate our road map. It also helps us understand how we need to monitor things over time. And so there's nothing quite new and an always-on basis, we're always reevaluating our processes and looking at have a pretty robust enterprise-wide transformation process around how do we remove the unnecessary work in the way that we support the business.  And again, that's not new to influence the outlook, but it is the reason why we can stay the course on the strategy that we have because we've always been operationally disciplined. So even when there's times with uncertainty, we're confident that we have the maneuverability to execute.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Once again, I am excited by the excellent progress ANSYS made in 2022. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success. The team's work our broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us even greater confidence in our ability to execute against long-term goals. Thank you again for joining today's call, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q4 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS and the largest quarter in our history. We beat our financial guidance for the quarter across all key metrics, including ACV, revenue, operating margin and earnings per share. Q4 was the culmination of a strong year for ANSYS. Our industry-leading product portfolio, loyal customer base, strong execution and growing markets enabled us to beat and operationally raise our guidance each quarter of 2022.  This, of course, was despite the continued economic uncertainties brought on by trade sanctions and the war in Ukraine. We grew ACV at 14% in constant currency for the full year. And in the process, we achieved our goal of $2 billion of ACV in 2022. Thanks to this excellent performance, we realized our long-term financial goal set at our Investor Day in 2019. I want to congratulate the entire one ANSYS team, including our dedicated channel partners for the significant accomplishment. In a few minutes, Nicole will discuss our guidance for Q1 and the entire year. This guidance reflects the power of our world-class products, the ongoing demand from our customers and the strength of our business.  I am excited that our results from 2022 and as well as our guidance for 2023 keep us on track to achieving the long-term goals we set out in our investor update in August of 2022. Looking back at 2022, we saw broad-based growth across all major industries, geographies and go-to-market routes. Our direct and indirect channels grew at double digits. Similarly, each of our go-to-market customer segments, enterprise strategic and volume accounts also grew by double digits in constant currency. The Hi-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top contributors.  From a geographical perspective, we saw strong performances with each region growing ACV better than we expected. And I'm excited to announce that one of our regions, the Americas, recorded over $1 billion in ACV for the first time in our history. I'm also pleased with the performance of our product lines from a more established flagship solutions to our newest offerings. Our top 2 customer agreements for Q4 ACV or in the global high-tech and semiconductor vertical and totaled more than $125 million. Through these contracts, 1 for 3 years and 1 for 4 years, the customers are expanding their use of ANSYS technology into new business segments, which is driving more users, more products and more computations.  These customers have realized a number of benefits by using ANSYS solutions. These include identifying silicon issues during the tape-out sign-off phase, which has saved millions of dollars in respin as well as reducing multilayer PCB preprocessing time from a month to just hours. In Q4, we also signed a contract with NuScale Power, an energy company that is developing modular light water reactors to supply reliable and abundant carbon-free nuclear energy. Instead of relying on cost save physical prototypes, NuScale leverages ANSYS technology to simulate designs for containment, thermal hydraulics and the structural integrity of reactors.  ANSYS solutions play a key role in an extensive product development process that must navigate a strict nuclear approval process in which delays can cost up to $3 million per day. As you heard with this new scale example, structural analysis plays a key role in customer sustainability initiatives. Continuing with the theme of sustainability through our structured solutions I would like to highlight a few examples of how these structures products working in conjunction with the rest of the ANSYS portfolio address this important topic.  ANSYS, of course, was founded as a structured company. Over the last 50 years, we have continually invested to enhance our structure's offerings. The applications for structural simulation have evolved as even the simplest products have become more complicated and today's structure is critical for customers to meet their sustainability goals. Two additional Q4 sales agreements totaling nearly $60 million are driving sustainability in the energy sector. They are both anchored in structural simulation combined with other physics.  The first is with an energy company that is using ANSYS simulation to make its traditional gas and steam industrial turbines more efficient as well as developing blades and the cells for its wind turbines. The second agreement is to assist with the digital transformation of another energy industry leader. This organization is expanding its use of our solutions to include a variety of applications, including structural design, thermal stress, and electric motor design for its robotic arms. By using ANSYS technology, the company has helped to decrease its development costs by 20%. While materials is a newer ANSYS product offering, it works hand-in-hand with structures, particularly when it comes to meeting customers' sustainability goals.  That's because as customers seek to develop more sustainable products, they often consider nontraditional materials, which includes new steels, composites and short fiber reinforced plastics. Structural simulation on these new materials can assess performance to ensure safety and durability while also reducing weight and waste through topology optimization. ANSYS customer nature architects, one of over 1,700 members of our start-up program, is using ANSYS simulation to help its customers further their sustainability programs.  As companies look for more environmentally friendly materials for their products, many are turning to artificially designed metal materials to incorporate functions such as heat conduction, deformation and weight reduction. Using ANSYS for structural analysis and fluid structure interaction Nature's architectures implemented a scripting language that automates simulation tasks and streamlines workflows, which enables the team to visualize and explore new structures.  Our recent release of ANSYS 2023 are one is also helping customers with their sustainability initiatives. For example, ANSYS Granta Selector's enhanced Ecodata and Eco audit functionality helps engineers explore and rapidly iterate amongst design scenarios and material options. The tool empowers users to make sustainable materials straight off early in the product development process before high-fidelity structural analyses are performed and costs are locked in.  ANSYS solutions are not only helping customers to develop more sustainable products, but we are enabling them to do so in a more resource-friendly manner. One such capability is in our one is resource prediction which leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict how much time and memory will be required. Resource prediction will help guide users to achieve their business objectives for example, reducing salt time or decreasing energy consumption.  Another innovation in R1 is aimed at helping customers increase the safety of electric vehicles. As you know, EV fires caused by battery abuse or impacts can be catastrophic. This advanced capability anchored in our structures portfolio brings together multiple ANSYS physics to analyze this complex problem. Specifically, our new safety workflow in ANSYS LS Dyna simultaneously simulates the comprehensive structural electrochemical and thermal responses of batteries that are damaged in an accident or through some other event.  We are not aware of any other commercial solution with this critical functionality to help make electric vehicles safer. In addition to our organic development, we are furthering our structures product leadership through M&A, namely with our recent acquisitions of and Rocky. Dynamor was a longtime ANSYS partner and leader in developing and selling explicit simulation solutions with an emphasis in the automotive industry. develops dummy and human body models in addition to providing development expertise for [indiscernible].  This critical capability provides customers with complete software solutions for crash simulation, occupant safety and production processes. Our acquisition of Rocky solves a sophisticated customer challenge. Nearly 70% of industrial products experienced bulk granular material flows, where different sized particles with complex shapes interact, potentially impacting our product efficiency or structural integrity. Solving this difficult problem requires deep knowledge of both structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.  With the solution from longtime partner, fully integrated into the ANSYS portfolio, users can solve these complex design problems. As a result, our customers will be able to reduce waste improve product quality and predict the performance and durability of equipment. Thanks in part to our sustainability initiatives, Newsweek has named ANSYS to its list of America's most responsible companies for 2023. ANSYS was included in the annual ranking of the 500 most responsible companies based on environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives.  Our inclusion on this list demonstrates our commitment to making customers improve efficiency and reduce waste by minimizing the need for physical prototyping. Turning to partners. I'm excited that Autodesk Fusion 360 Signal Integrity extension powered by ANSYS was commercially released in November by embedding ANSYS' electromagnetic simulation capabilities within Autodesk Fusion 360 printed circuit board designers can access near real-time insights earlier in the design process for smart consumer products.  I'm also pleased that our electromagnetic and semiconductor solutions including ANSYS Redhawk-SC, ANSYS RaptorH and ANSYS HFSS have received GLOBALFOUNDRY certification for its flagship 22FDX platform. That certification enables trip designers to lower costs by reducing excess safety margins and improving system performance without compromising reliability or risking unexpected and damaging interactions amongst design elements. In summary, Q4 was an excellent quarter that kept a fantastic year for ANSYS.  We beat guidance across all key metrics and delivered the best year in company history. And of course, we exceeded our long-term goal of $2 billion in ACV. I am confident in our ability to achieve the goals we set during our most recent investor update in August. Despite some economic uncertainties, our end markets remain robust, and our business has proven its resilience over the years. Over the past few weeks, I've had the opportunity to speak with members of our direct sales team as well as several of our global channel partners.  Reporting strength in the market from the largest enterprises through SMB accounts. Given the importance of research and development, and innovation. The demand for ANSYS simulation continues to be strong because customers understand our compelling value proposition. And that is continuing to drive more users, more products and more computations throughout our customer base. Our momentum coming out of Q4, our strong customer relationships, our robust end markets and our leading product portfolio will propel us through 2023 and beyond.  As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve future milestones. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Sure. Ken. So let me briefly talk about aerospace. Our aerospace customers are facing relatively complex challenges, and it's pretty broad-based. And so when you think about some of our business -- we have customers who are focusing on aircraft engines. And obviously, there are a number of trends in that space, whether it comes to lightweighting and energy efficiency, in some cases, electric engines, different fuel sources, so there's a number of different levels of innovation taking place at various points in the AMB aerospace industry. Obviously, in the Space 2.0 world, there are -- there continues to be a lot of innovation and both in larger companies as well as smaller companies.  And then, of course, you've seen some of the work that we've done with significant projects like the web telescope and the dark mission where our project where our technologies were used in the development of those projects. So there's a lot of different activity across the space in this entire aerospace and defense world for us. And I believe that the demand for our offerings continues to be robust, and we see a pipeline in that space as well. So Jay, so firstly, when you think about our technical priorities will be areas that we're making investments in our business, I would say that probably 5 broad areas where we're making technological investments. The first I would broadly categorize as numerics and that includes physics models and methods for both the physics and multiphysics. That's just the core physics part of what we do. The second area is in AI machine learning where we're making significant investments across the portfolio.  Our customers today are seeing the benefits of ANSYS products that have been enhanced through AI. We've, of course, filed patents to cover some of our work in the space, and we continue to make significant investments in AI and getting our customers to be able to take advantage of this great technology in the context of our offerings. The third area is high-performance computing. That obviously includes -- that obviously includes both HBC as well as CPUs, GPUs and so for example, if you look at R1, we just announced some really exciting work on [indiscernible] for example, our optical solver where we can show that a single GPU is something like 8x faster than the 32 core CPU machine.  And then, of course, we're very excited about a fluent multi-GPU solver which allows fluid simulations to run natively on multiple GPUs, and that is a game changer in terms of performance, and we can show tremendous orders of magnitude scale up and in terms of both performance as well as, of course, cost savings when it comes to things like energy usage and others. So we are very excited about the work that we've done in the GPU space, and we continue to make investments over there.  Cloud and experience is the fourth area. That includes the work that we're doing in cloud. You may have seen some recent announcements where we're -- we've announced some of our cloud technology in the context of our cloud marketplace offerings, and we continue to invest in cloud native capabilities as well as user experience. And the last area is in digital engineering, and that includes things like digital twins, mission, system simulation and there, we continue to make advances.  And you saw, obviously, some of the capabilities of our product lines on the space. Unintended when you -- when we talked about James Webb as well as the dark mission, but certainly, we have ongoing investments in that space as well, and that includes things like NBFC. So broadly, there are 5 areas: numerics, AI, ML, high-performance computing, cloud and experience and digital engineering and these are the areas that are driving our next-generation activities. Yes, it does. Thank you for the question. Look, the way you should think about it is, from an ANSYS perspective, we're really agnostic as to where someone might be able to run our solutions. I mean we want -- I mean, one of the primary uses of cloud today is for high-performance computing applications. And so we know that we have customers who are taking advantage of the licenses that we make available to them and they're using them in the public cloud. And really, from our perspective, we want people to have the flexibility to be able to use to be whatever environment where they have compute available. Obviously, as time goes on, there is a clear trend even in the largest organizations, which have invested in data centers there is a clear trend towards taking advantage of public cloud.  And obviously, as the public cloud vendors are continuing to invest in scientific computing capabilities, where the nodes that are available have the requisite needs for scientific computing, that's also driving incremental usage. So it is clearly an ongoing it is clearly an ongoing direction and something that we expect to see happen. From our strategy, I mean, look, we are very excited about the public cloud being used from our strategy perspective, we have, as you know, 2 distinct kinds of cloud offerings, what we call cloud marketplace and what we call cloud native and this combination of marketplace and native takes full advantage of everything that we previously talked about as well as some of the newly developed and announced cloud capabilities.  The marketplace offerings are really about delivering flexibility to our existing customer base. So it's really giving customers, as I said earlier, giving them the option to maintain the same patterns that they employ today, taking advantage of familiar ANSYS products while leveraging the benefit of cloud computing and their own pre-existing relationships with cloud service providers. And so you mentioned the ANSYS Gateway with AWS, which we released in Q4 of last year. You talked about the announcement we made in February of this year where we extended our Microsoft partnership in the Agile marketplace offering. So there's a number of activities in that space.  On the cloud native space, we're targeting new users and new use cases, and that's really a cloud-based platform for the development and deployment of new workflows and applications. And as if you remember back at our Investor Day, we talked about a new area of verticalized simulation applications where the power of simulation gets extended far beyond its current user base to, frankly, anyone who needs predictive analytics.  And so we have initiatives and R&D efforts underway in that space. And it's still very early days, but you should stay tuned for more progress as we continue to move this exciting technology for the rollout. Sure. I mean, look, the automotive business is one of our top 3 industries, as you know, top 3 verticals as we define it, growth high tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation. And it continues to be a strong area. And we've got deep relationships with our automotive customers as they continue to face these complex challenges with their products. And there's a number of things -- there's a number of areas where they're continuing to innovate. Firstly, obviously, if you think about passenger cars for a moment, there is clearly a direction towards fuel efficiency and so on in more traditional cars in the traditional internal combustion engine and that deals with lightweighting, et cetera, crash testing, those are across all of the product lines.  But as you start to think about the next-generation electrification alternative energies, those are all important themes where customers are investing and making investments for the long term. Battery technology. And I hope me mention an example of some of the work that we're doing there with impact analysis with the -- in my script earlier. So there's a lot of work in multiple areas taking place that are supporting the automotive customers I would just point out, by the way, that as we think about the work that takes place, for example, with electrification in the automotive industry, the work that leads to that includes the entire supply chain and then may be suppliers who are in our high-tech vertical or building very high-tech components that are then being used in the automotive space.  And so if you start to look at the entire supply chain, the impact of automotive is very large across the industry as they're looking at all of these different areas. Now the breadth of our technology and the breadth of the portfolio I mean it's so large that we are able to help our customers as they are looking at all of these different issues. Sustainability is another example. And that's why I think you're seeing strength in these industries, the sophisticated industries, which require these -- which are going through these transformations, we are able to help our customers navigate through these next-generation [indiscernible] that they're facing or trends of the dealing with the market. Once again, I am excited by the excellent progress ANSYS made in 2022. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success. The team's work our broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us even greater confidence in our ability to execute against long-term goals. Thank you again for joining today's call, and have a great day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that 2022 was another outstanding year for ANSYS, and we're optimistic about our 2023 and our long-term outlook given the momentum in our business. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we beat our financial guidance across all key metrics.  This is particularly noteworthy given that we operationally raised our full year guidance across ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for all 3 quarters throughout the course of the year. Additionally, in 2022, we reached new company records across key financial metrics, including ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in the quarter and full year 2022 with growth seen across geographic regions, customer types and industries.  As a result of our broad-based performance, we achieved $2.032 billion in ACV in 2022, which surpasses the $2 billion commitment we made at our 2019 Investor Day. For additional context, when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates, full year 2022 ACV would equal approximately $2.113 billion, further demonstrating the magnitude and quality of our outperformance, which we delivered amidst a global pandemic and a challenging and volatile macro economic environment on. All accounts, 2022 was an outstanding year and we are entering 2023 with momentum and a strong backlog.  Now let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and then I'll provide our outlook and key assumptions for 2023 and Q1. Beginning with ACV. We delivered $818 million in Q4 and which grew year-over-year, 8% or 13% in constant currency. For the full year, we recognized $2.32 billion in ACV, growing 9% or 14% in constant currency.  For the quarter and full year, performance was broad-based across customer types, geographies and industries. Our wide rate in growth is evidence of the essential nature of our market leading simulation portfolio and exceptional execution. For additional context, our full year ACV growth of 14% in constant currency came in 4 points higher relative to where we initially set guidance last February. Throughout the course of the year, we absorbed $82 million of nonoperational headwinds and including unprecedented U.S. dollar strengthening and the exit from business in Russia and Belarus, which was more than offset by $94 million of incremental operational momentum. ACV from recurring sources in 2022 grew 9% or 15% in constant currency year-over-year and represented 81% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription leases. For the full year 2022, ACV performance continues to be fueled by the strong growth in subscription leases which grew 18% or 24% in constant currency. Subscription lease ACV crossed over $1 billion to $1.2 billion or 57% of total ACV for the full year.  We continue to expect the growth of our subscription leases to be the underlying driver of the strong annuity that has been building over time and will continue to be a foundation for future growth. Q4 total revenue was $694.7 million and grew 5% or 10% in constant currency, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and was positively impacted by outperforming on ACV. Full year revenue was $2.073 billion and grew 7% or 13% in constant currency. We had strong top line performance in 2022 with ACV and revenue, both growing double digit in constant currency at 14% and 13%, respectively.  In both Q4 and the full year, we executed against our business model of double-digit. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of over $1.4 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid fourth quarter gross margin of 94% and an operating margin of 48% which was better than our guidance. We had full year gross margin of 91.8% and operating margin of 42%.  Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue. The result was fourth quarter EPS of $3.09, which was also better than our guidance. For the full year, EPS was $7.99. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was 18%. Our operating cash flows in the fourth quarter totaled $174 million which benefited from outperforming on ACV and strong collections.  Our unlevered operating cash flow was $181.1 million. For the full year, we had operating cash flow of $631 million, which grew 15%, meaningfully outpacing ACV growth despite significant foreign exchange and nonoperational headwinds. For modeling purposes, 2022 operating cash flow translates to unlevered operating cash flow of $648.1 million. For additional context, we absorbed $39 million of nonoperational headwinds since initiating 2022 operating cash flow guidance last February.  These headwinds, including the exit from this in Russia and Belarus and the adverse impact of foreign exchange were on top of the headwinds from R&E capitalization tax legislation and other law changes already factored into our February 2022 guidance. The $39 million of nonoperational headwinds was offset by $70 million of incremental operational performance throughout the year. The result was operating cash flow that was $31 million better than the midpoint of our February guidance.  This outperformance was driven by several factors, including outperforming on the ACV and margin expansion and the timing of collections. We ended the quarter with $614.6 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 225,000 shares during the quarter for around $50 million. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 725,000 shares for around $206 million which was 174% of the average capital return to shareholders in the form of share repurchase over the past 3 years.  We have 1.7 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We delivered an outstanding Q4 and full year 2022 and we are entering 2023 with momentum and a robust pipeline and backlog, which gives us continued confidence in achieving the long-term outlook that we laid out at our 2022 investor update of 12% constant currency ACV compounded annual growth, inclusive of 1 to 2 points of tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flow from 2022 to 2025.  Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $2.265 billion to $2.335 billion, which represents growth of 11.5% to 14.9% or 9.9% to 13.4% in constant currency. We have a balanced and diversified business, which is driving the broad-based performance and double-digit ACV growth that we expect to see in 2023. Notably, the midpoint of our guidance is on our model of 12% constant currency compounded annual growth that we set at our investor update in August.  We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.242 billion to $2.322 billion, which is growth of 8.2% to 12% and or 6.9% to 10.8% in constant currency. Let me touch on some of the assumptions embedded in our full year guidance. We continue to expect broad-based growth and continued momentum from our large enterprise customers and SMB customers. We also continue to assume that our subscription leases grow faster than perpetual licenses and as a result, ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue as the business model shift towards subscription lease continues. Our full year guidance is based on how we see our book of business and pipeline today.  This brings me to our operating margin guidance. We expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.34 and to $8.86. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be 17.5% and which is 0.5 point lower than the 18% rate we had in 2022. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance.  We are providing guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term $3 billion cumulative cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update in August. Our 2023 unlevered operating cash flow guidance is a range of $710 million to $760 million. We expect to see another year of significant growth in cash flow levels year-over-year. The implied unlevered operating cash flow growth of 10% to 17% for 2023 on top of the 16% unlevered operating cash flow growth we saw in 2022 exhibits the continued strong operating leverage in our business model.  Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow and the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now let me turn to the guidance for Q1. For the first quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $380 million to $400 million and revenue in the range of $482.5 million to $507.5 million. We expect Q1 operating margin in the range of 35.3% to 37.3% and EPS in the range of $1.53 to $1.71. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q1 are contained in the prepared remarks document.  I would like to thank the ANSYS team for a fantastic quarter rounding out another exceptionally strong year. Our performance is evidence of the critical nature of our market-leading simulation portfolio as well as the team's operational discipline and focus on customer excellence. Our consistent performance and execution enabled us to deliver above and beyond our 2019 Investor Day and 2022 annual commitments despite a continued challenging and volatile macro environment.  Our core simulation market is strong and growing, and we are excited about the immense opportunity that lies ahead as we continue to help our customers solve their most complex product development challenges. We are entering 2023 with considerable momentum, a resilient and diversified business model with 3 vectors of growth and a healthy backlog and pipeline. All of which fuels the optimism embedded in our full year and long-term outlook.  Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Yes. Well, thanks, Ken. And yes, we were really, really pleased with the exceptional close of our cash flow performance at the end of the year, as you point out, it grew quite substantially delevered operating cash flow in 2022 in our outlook range of 10% to 17% unlevered operating cash flow indicates continued momentum in the business overall.  As you know, I mean, we gave long-term guidance in August. We're not prepared to update the long-term guidance. But when you look at the combined -- the 2-year growth rate of 2022 and 2023 from the ECB perspective, and the comparative unlevered operating cash flow growth rate over that period, you could see the substantial operating leverage and margin expansion associated with that it's a little early for us to update long-term guidance we just gave it 6 months ago. But what I can say is -- and there's a lot of exogenous factors that impacted unlevered operating cash flow number as you know, foreign exchange had a pretty meaningful impact to that last year.  As an example, we're still not quite out of the woods as it relates to that so not really prepared to give anything longer term than 2023 today, but we feel really good about the underlying strength of the operational momentum of the business. We have a very disciplined investment model around putting investment in, that drives incremental growth. And those are things that we -- that we expect to be able to continue to build on over the next couple of years. Yes, sure. So maybe just kind of level set on what the makeup of 2022 was in 2023, we can talk about the long term. So as we previously mentioned, the inorganic contribution from ZMAX last year, we had said it was about $20 million. And that, as you point out, contributed around a point of growth to the overall performance last year. As we look into 2023, we completed 2 acquisitions at the end of the quarter after our earnings announcement. were the most notable were 2 that completed at that time. Just some context of those is a product we were the primary reseller for already.  And it's also a pretty small product line so it doesn't have a very material run rate to the business. And although we already had a relationship with we expect the inorganic contribution from that transaction to be around EUR 30 million to EUR 35 million of ACV in revenue. So with just under half of that in Q1. So there's a pretty different SKUs to that business relative to ours. So that would put us around the 10% constant currency growth in ACV when you exclude Dyna more our full year outlook which is on our business model of double-digit growth, including ACV.  As it relates to the long-term view of ACV and how we see it, I mean, we there isn't a perspective in particular around what happened in 2022 and how that would change the outlook in the future are out, we still remain confident in the 12% compounded annual growth rate through the course of that time. And certainly, as trends in the business change and the underlying -- anything that foundationally would shift that growth objective, we would certainly update our long-term guidance at that time.  But right now, we're really pleased with what we delivered in 2022 and we're building -- we have a really strong outlook for 2023 on top of a really strong performance in 2022, and we're really pleased to continue to be on that model that we set out in. Yes. I mean as we said in our prepared remarks, and I think we've said that throughout last year, the underlying drivers of growth in 2022 was very broad-based across customer geographies industries and the outlook considers very similar broad-based. There's no individual customer concentration. There is one element to Q1 guidance, and I had think I briefly mentioned this in the first part of my answer to you on M&A -- on the M&A impact. does have a slightly different SKUs to their business. There's just under half of the business that actually happens -- and so a little bit more than half -- a little bit less than -- or bit less than half of the business in Q1. So there is a little bit of a dynamic around Dynamar that is earlier on in the year relative to the future periods in the year that we have a slightly different pattern than maybe some of the more kind of smaller impacts on a quarterly basis that you see of some of the other M&A that we've done in the past. Yes. And Jay, to answer your question on kind of connection to customer demand, I think the way that you could think about it, if you look at these if you kind of refer to the trends that Ajei just referred to as well as the underlying kind of performance in our industry mix. I mean much of what's driving that demand are the complex multi-business use cases and the trends that are driving investment in those areas, right? So we talked about double-digit growth -- double-digit growth in automotive in Q4 as an example, and the things that are driving those trends are really around the next generation of vehicles and technology that are connected to things like electrification, sustainability, those types of things.  As you know, those are not a single component level. Single [indiscernible] problem, which are falling to that traditional use case, they are complex multiphysics forms that involve both component level all the way to the system and systems of system level particularly in cases like space 2.0 alerting. And so what we are seeing is more and more of that strategic selling motion becoming the main focus of -- or the main motion of how we engage our customers and be solving those higher order complex problems, which makes us a very important partner regardless of what kind of economic times, people may be having -- we help sell those very difficult problems known can help sell. Sure. So first, one of the aspects to the business since the accounting change for the 606 accounting change several years back. is that the dynamics around revenue recognition creates a lot of volatility in the P&L and particularly on a quarterly basis. And that's because the difference in the underlying mix of licenses on a year-over-year basis can significantly influence the dynamics around revenue recognition. And so the margins the kind of pattern throughout the year is a little less meaningful in kind of extrapolating kind of where directional momentum is going particularly in the P&L. We do also have similar variability in quarters as customers have moved to multiyear leases -- it is not as much of a selling motion where it's only about an event at a point in time that kind of comes up once a year, there's an ongoing selling process that happens kind of throughout the year where ACV can be remixed relative for a single customer relative to what the prior year looks like.  So there's considerable volatility that happened throughout the quarters. And that's why we're really focused on being really clear about our full year guidance where our full year outlook is for ACV and operating cash flow and particularly in particular, in the P&L overall. And the way that we feel we're indicating kind of the change in the trajectory of the business is with our updates to the full year guidance. And so that's how that's how we would think about it overall is really around that. And I think you could see that in kind of how we went through our guidance last year.  And if we could look at the beginning of the year, there was a 4-point difference in ACV as an example, as we progressed throughout the year. And that's because our philosophy is that we look -- we give guidance based on what we see ahead of us today and what the pipeline in the book of business looks like today. And as things change, up or down, we will be clear about what changes. We don't try to create wide ranges, which predict macro trends or things that we can't control. We try to look at it in terms of where our book of business is today. So does that answer your question? Yes, absolutely. I mean it is the variability within the timing of things in the quarters can create some ups and downs throughout the year. But the overall outlook, which we think is quite strong out of the gate is really a reflection of broad-based demand, as you point out. Cash flow, so we do not give quarterly cash flow guidance because the dynamics around cash flow within a quarter because change because of timing of payments that fall over date lines -- or timing of collections that could sell over datelines quite easily and make really meaningful differences. But for modeling purposes, I think you can assume that a meaningful portion of the cash flow occurs in Q1, particularly off of a strong Q4.  And Q1 and Q4 tend to be the largest cash flow quarters. The middle 2 quarters tend to be a little bit more muted with Q2 being probably the lower water mark. Yes. Thanks, Saket. So as you point out, in almost every acquisition we do is dilutive to actual margin. So there is no accretion for margin that occurs with some or any individual acquisition we have. Now as it relates to cash flow, Cash flow is also relatively more muted in the first year. I mean, sometimes you can have some slight positive impacts cash flow. But as you know, there's meaningful year one expenses associated with integration and those types of things, which are normal operating cash outflows. And so as it relates to the most significant kind of individual contributor to the overall portfolio would be the example. That did have some contribution to the underlying cash flow guide, but it's really modest relative to what it might be on an ongoing basis. Thanks, Tyler. So what I would say is, yes, that the operating -- we have very strong operating leverage in the business because we have relatively low variable costs and so that's why you can definitely see as we continue to accelerate growth, the operating leverage in the business. Now it comes down to what do you do with that incremental growth? And how do you reinvest it and I would say that we have a tremendous amount of operational discipline around decision-making around investments that is not new to ANSYS. It is kind of embedded in how we make decisions and how we prioritize where we put investments with an eye towards how do we get return with a balance on what is helping us for the short term and how are we making sure that we're prudently investing for the long term.  And so that strategy has served us well. It has allowed us to continue to invest in the business as things -- as things are good and make sure we can accelerate our road map. It also helps us understand how we need to monitor things over time. And so there's nothing quite new and an always-on basis, we're always reevaluating our processes and looking at have a pretty robust enterprise-wide transformation process around how do we remove the unnecessary work in the way that we support the business.  And again, that's not new to influence the outlook, but it is the reason why we can stay the course on the strategy that we have because we've always been operationally disciplined. So even when there's times with uncertainty, we're confident that we have the maneuverability to execute."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President, Investor Relations. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. DeBriyn for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q4 and updated fiscal year 2022 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Important factors that may affect our future results are discussed in our public filings. Forward-looking statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information. During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Q3 was yet another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we once again beat across our key metrics, including ACV, revenue, operating margins and earnings per share. This gives us further confidence in the business and has enabled us to operationally raise our full year guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. As we have previously discussed the strength and the resilience of the ANSYS business come in part because of the number and the diversity of customers we serve, ANSYS has 10s of 1000s of customers across multiple industries, including high tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation. Those three sectors were again our largest contributors in Q3. Our largest contract for the quarter was in the high tech and semiconductor space, a $59 million three-year agreement with an international electronics company. This global brand has been challenged by the increasing complexity of its products, as semiconductor chips continue to get smaller, which has led to issues such as voltage drop. By continually enhancing our solution to semiconductor and other areas of physics, we will not only be able to stave off any competitive challenges in this long-term account, but we increase the number of ANSYS products the customer uses, the number of end users as well as the amount of computations performed. This new contract broadens our existing footprint, which included products from across our multi physics portfolio, such as structures, fluids, electromagnetics, and materials. This is a perfect example of a discussion at a recent investor update that ANSYS is growing across three vectors, more products, more users, and more computations. ANSYS is also well balanced across geographies, with a little less than 50% of our business coming from the Americas and the remainder roughly split between EMEA and Asia Pacific. This diversity in our customer base means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. It also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any specific customer or industry or country. In Q3, I'm excited to report that from a geographic perspective, we saw a very strong revenue growth from both Asia Pacific and EMEA while the Americas came in as expected. Adding to the strength of our business is a broad and deep product portfolio, which includes flagship product in structures, fluids, electromagnetics, semiconductors, optics and mission. As such, we are not over reliant on any individual product line, which further contributes to ANSYS\u2019 resilience. Additionally, our proven portfolio enables us to attract new customers, as well as to displace competitor technology. For example, our startup program is continuing to grow as these nascent companies take advantage of ANSYS solutions. The program has had over 1,600 customers across 53 countries. While members of our startup program represent a small piece of our overall business, they are aggressive users of our products. And with the program's high graduation rates, more and more of these customers become active contributors to the ANSYS business. While it can be difficult to replace an incumbent in our space, we have also grown our customer base by displacing competitors. For example, in Q3, we won a contract with an industrial tool manufacturer, that was a key account at one of our competitors. That customer is now using ANSYS\u2019 structural, fluids and electronic solutions for the development of its power tools. On these calls, I often highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several calls, I have discussed the unparalleled scalability of our best-in-class fluid products. I highlighted the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I discuss how customers are using our solutions in the development of next generation semiconductors. And I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. But this call, I would like to reiterate some of the key takeaways from a recent investor update. During the update in August, we discussed how typical enterprise software companies have only two vectors of growth, more products, and more users. ANSYS however, has a third, more computations, let me briefly discuss each of them. Traditionally, simulation involves a single user leveraging a single ANSYS product for each individual simulation. Today, as we partner with our customers to solve more complex R&D challenges, there is an increased demand for multiple physics, including structures and fluids, electronics, photonics and others to work together by transcending individual physics to connect workflows that solve complex multi physics problems. Our customers can simulate and analyze the physical world at a system and admission level. Addressing these complex new use cases inherently requires the use of multiple physics solvers, leading to an increased number of multi product sales. In Q3, we signed a seven-figure contract with a longtime Space 2.0 company that has standardized on ANSYS as multi physics solutions across all of its engineering departments to develop safer and more reliable launch vehicles. With this new agreement, the company is now expanding its ANSYS footprint to include our material intelligence solution as its central materials database. We have also invested in the overall user experience, which is driving more end users of ANSYS solutions. Remember that in the past, only expert engineering analysts could take advantage of simulation. Today, ANSYS simulation is being used by all levels of engineers, thanks to our automated workflows and integrations with other systems that make answer solutions more intuitive and easier to use. That means that different types of engineers can fully take advantage of the benefits of ANSYS simulation, and it is driving the expansion of simulation usage to more users upstream and downstream of the validation process. In Q3, ANSYS calls the largest healthcare contract in our history, a seven-figure agreement that will dramatically expand the number of users at an American eyecare company. realizing the benefits of simulation, this existing customer has launched a digital twin and digital engineering initiative that will triple the number of users of engineering simulation technology in the next 18 to 24 months. The third vector of our growth is through more computations. ANSYS is able to monetize customers workloads, as they run the larger, more complex calculations needed to solve next generation product challenges. A single ANSYS user can leverage multiple products and can run hundreds of simulations across 1000s of cores in parallel, which is critical functionality, as even the most common products become more complex. We provide our customers with open, scalable offerings, supported by the major cloud platforms to enhance and extend our industry leading simulation portfolio. This flexibility enables our customers to maximize the value they realize from simulation, while scaling up to address the increasing complexity of next generation product development. We recently announced the launch of our ANSYS Gateway powered by Amazon Web Services. With this addition to our comprehensive cloud offering, customers can easily access, subscribe and configure ANSYS applications from a single location. ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS allows broader access to high performance computing by bringing down the traditional hardware barriers that have limited innovation for many of our customers. Our focus on expanding the portfolio of physics on creating a platform to enable and manage complex multi physics solutions. And an expanding simulation use cases unlocks greater customer value, which enables all three vectors of growth for ANSYS. The application of ANSYS simulation technologies can be manifested in varied and distinct ways. For example, last time, I discussed the multiple roles ANSYS solutions played in the testing, launch and deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope. Keeping with the applications of ANSYS and space, I'd like to briefly highlight the role that we played in NASA's recent dark mission. As you may recall, in September, NASA smashed an unmanned spacecraft into an asteroid in an attempt to alter its orbit. The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab extensively used ANSYS SCK through a mission planning process from formulating darts trajectory through the asteroid system, as well as to visualize relevant vectors and attitudes. The thermal team use SCK\u2019s for mission environment when checking the location of the sun, relative to the satellite during critical maneuvers. NASA has announced that the dark mission exceeded its highest expectations by shortening the asteroids orbit by 32 minutes. This marks the first-time humanity has changed the orbit of a celestial object. And I would like to congratulate the team at Johns Hopkins and NASA for this success in this inspirational and potentially lifesaving mission. This example demonstrates the range of use cases, as well as the impact of ANSYS solutions. Next, I'd like to highlight 1000s of ANSYS employees around the world. They are of course, what makes ANSYS so special. So I'm very proud that Newsweek Magazine has ranked ANSYS as 13th amongst the most loved workplaces at US companies. The ranking considers employee survey responses, external ratings, and interviews with company leaders. This recognition is just one more testament to ANSYS\u2019 unique culture and the impact we have on the world. In closing, Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, one that provides momentum as we close out the year, and look ahead to 2023. With our product leadership, proven performance and resilient business model, I'm more confident than ever in the future of ANSYS and the innovations, we're helping our customers to drive. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and full year 2022. The third quarter demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and better than our guidance, revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded our Q3 guidance driven by ACV outperformance. Both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well during the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $409.3 million and grew year-over-year 12% or 20% in constant currency. We saw broad base constant currency growth across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 16% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. ACV from recurring sources represented 79% of the total in the third quarter. Q3 total Revenue was $473.7 million and grew 6% or 15% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance driven by outperforming our expected ACV. Asia Pacific and EMEA drove strong Q3 revenue growth. We had robust top line performance in Q3 with ACV and revenue both growing double digit in constant currency at 20% and 15%, respectively. In both Q3 and year-to-date, we executed against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We close the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of over $1.1 billion, which grew 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 91.1% and an operating margin of 41%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue, as well as the timing of investments that have moved into the fourth quarter of the year. The result with third quarter EPS of $1.77, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18%. The tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our operating cash flows in the third quarter totaled $127.2 million. Our unlevered operating cash flows were $132 million. We ended the quarter with $632.7 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. We delivered a robust Q3 and our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. Offsetting our year-to-date performance and strong full year outlook is persistent and significant US dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rates embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We expect full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1,975 million to $2 billion, which represents growth of 5.6% to 6.9% or 12% to 13.4% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our full year constant currency ACV growth compared to our August guidance. For additional context, the midpoint of our ACV guidance when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates would be equal to approximately $2,080 million and would exceed our 2019 investor day ACV targets. Our full year constant currency ACV growth raise is driven by the strong performance and our resilient business model. That performance drove a full year ACV operational increase of $8 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $20 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. Our strong performance has been consistent throughout 2022. Since we issued full year ACV guidance in February, we have raised the midpoint of our constant currency growth rate guidance by almost three points from around 10% in February to almost 13%, constant currency growth with our current guidance. The strong organic growth in our business has been driving our improving outlook. Turning to revenue, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2,035 million which is growth of 3.55 to 5.4%, or 10.1% to 11.9% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth compared to our August guidance, which reflects a full year revenue operational increase of $12 million. This momentum was offset by $24 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. Similar to ACV, for revenue, we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2022 constant currency growth rate guidance by almost two points from around 9% in February to 11% with our current guidance. Turning to EPS, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.48 to $7.80. Relative to our August guidance, our full year EPS increased $0.12 from better operational performance, which was offset by $0.17 of incremental foreign exchange headwind. As a reminder, some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full year operating margins to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $600 million. Relative to our August guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $2 million from better operational performance, which was offset by $7 million of incremental foreign exchange headwind. Also note on a year-over-year basis, operating cash flow continues to face nonoperational headwinds, including the timing impact of R&D capitalization regulations, and higher interest expense given rising interest rates. Since January 2022, we have seen significant US dollar strengthening relative to all global currencies that contribute to our results. Our largest exposures are to the euro and Japanese yen. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $120 million, and operating cash flow by approximately 40 million. Now, let me turn to guidance for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $761.3 million to $786.3 million, and revenue in the range of $621.8 million to $656.8 million. We expect Q4 operating margin in the range of 45.6% to 48.5%, and EPS in the range of $2.58 to $2.90. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q4 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Our core simulation market is strong and diversified with consistent demand from our customers as they encounter increasingly complex product development challenges. This strong core market, coupled with our market leading portfolio, deep customer relationships, and highly recurring financial model with three vectors of growth, makes ANSYS\u2019 business highly resilient. All of this is driving the underlying momentum in our business and gives us confidence in the increased outlook for full year constant currency ACV and revenue growth. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove a robust Q3 financial performance and momentum going into our last quarter of the year. We once again delivered an exceptional quarter which demonstrated the ongoing strength of the ANSYS business. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute against our outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Gal Munda with Wolfe Research.\nGal Munda: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just, Ajei, you mentioned how the different vectors of growth are working for you. And I wanted to kind of double down a little bit on the computational power that your customers use. And just relate that to the business model you have today. Can you just give us a little bit more color on how you're able to capture that as people? Is that relationship from one engineer using one license at a particular problem? When they start solving more complex problems? How do you capture the value from economic perspective as well? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Gal, good morning. That's a great question. So the way you should think about how we monetize that is, it's really through product licensing. So when we license our technology to customers, we give them access to the use of us, take a multi-year lease as an example, we give them access to use our technology for a duration of time. And we also give them access to high performance computing capability. And that HPC translates into license software for us, license revenue for us or license ACV. And of course, access to the solvers themselves also show up as licenses. So in the aggregate, both the ability to use the technology on more processing translates into license for us. And the ability to use more of our software in that context translates into more license. So that's how we monetize it. And that's how it shows up in our financials.\nGal Munda: That is really helpful. Thank you. Interesting. And then I like kind of the point that Nicole made, which is if you look at the constant currency exchange rates from 2019, you as a team managed to beat the guidance -- well manage to be the guidance by about 4%, 5%. If you look back and kind of, think about when you gave us that guidance, I think it was in September \u201819. And what happened during that time we had, we had COVID, and everything, what has allowed you, which parts have potentially played out better then when you still look the time to allow you too, even though anything that was going on, from a macro perspective, you're able to kind of achieve those targets, what surprised you maybe on the positive or maybe even on the -- what ended up being maybe a little bit slower than you thought. Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Why don\u2019t I jump in Gal, because I have some context. And then maybe I'll ask Nicole to add a little bit more. So if you look back at 2019, and you consider the evolution of our business, and we describe some of this in the investor update presentation that we did earlier this year, we've been in the process of a transformation in our business model, where we've been taking advantage of these three vectors of growth that you alluded to earlier. And we've been using that to really transform our business model in the way that we support our customers. So we've increased the amount of lease that we do with our customers. And that translates into obviously stickier relationships with our customers as we go forward. So look, at the end of the day, it comes down to the products that we have, and the capabilities that we provide and our ability to address some of our customers\u2019 most challenging market needs. And we have an amazing portfolio, we've continued to build in that portfolio, we've continued to expand that capability that makes it even more relevant for our customers today as compared with years ago. And the nature of the business model, the nature of the ability to monetize that relationship, all of that translate into our ability to be very resilient, no matter what happens out there in the market. So we have a very resilient business model that I'm excited about. We've talked about how we are and I mentioned this in my script, we talked about how our technology is very broad across multiple physics, we're not overly reliant on a single product line, we talked about how we're, we have presence in multiple industry verticals. And we mentioned, I mentioned high tech, I mentioned automotive, I mentioned aerospace as examples. And of course, we have presence in others. And we talked about our geographical distribution as well. So that gives us the ability to be resilient when a particular industry changes or when there are particular challenges in an individual market. Now, in the face of a global pandemic, of course, as you saw going through this, that's an overarching global phenomenon. And there, it just goes back to the core value proposition of our products, which is we help our customers build better products, bring them to market faster, at lower cost, we help them reduce warranty costs, we help them be more efficient. And so that combination of being able to support them from a top line perspective and drive both top line growth, as well as support them from a cost perspective really stands us in good stead in rough economic times, which is obviously what we've seen in the last couple of years. So that part, in part contributes to the momentum of the business that we've seen in the past. And frankly, that contributes to the momentum of the business that we're seeing, that we're seeing today. And I've had the opportunity to now spend a number of over the last couple of months, I've had an opportunity to spend time with customers in person in the US, in Europe, in Asia. And what I'm hearing from customers around the globe, is very consistent perspectives on the pressures that they're having to be able to continue to drive their businesses forward. So they've all got multiyear product roadmaps that they need to advance their businesses. And frankly, they're use-- they're relying on us. They're relying on simulation to be able to not only deliver on those roadmaps but to be able to deliver on those roadmaps as efficiently as possible. Because they know that simulation can help them save time and money through the avoidance of physical testing and things of that nature. So that's all contributed to the momentum that we have in the business. And I'm really excited about where we are right now.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ajei in the opening remarks, you referenced a number of deals where you displace competition in accounts and just feels like this is something that you're talking about more here on these earnings call relative to historical quarters. So could you just walk-through kind of the opportunity that you see there? Have you seen kind of win rates pick up and is this kind of a function of some of the innovation at ANSYS. And perhaps inorganically, just kind of combining products that you've acquired into the core suite that's allowing you to do this, just kind of talk about the opportunity on the competitive displacement side. And then I had a quick follow up for Nicole. Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Yes, so firstly, Tyler, the first point is competitive displacements are in our industry relatively difficult, right? They don't happen. They don't happen on a regular basis. These are relatively difficult. And when they do happen, it's something that you are excited about because the customer has a specific need. And obviously, they're not able to satisfy that need, based on whatever products that may currently be using. And whatever they're using right now may or may not, if it's not able to address their needs, not able to solve their problems, not able to provide the level of fidelity or accuracy they're looking for, not able to integrate with the systems that they need to, they'll look for another solution. And as you rightly pointed out, we were excited. And I mentioned this in my script, we were excited about one of our competitive displacement this year, that we noted. But more generally, the nature of these displacements is driven by as you pointed out the strength of the portfolio. Look, we've made a lot of investment in improving the product from a performance perspective, from a usability perspective, from an integration perspective, if you look at some of the releases that we've announced, for example, most recently, in R3, in R2 in 2022 R2 one example on scalability. I mean, we're using a GPU scalability and achieving enormous acceleration in solving capacity for our customers. These are all incredible innovations that they value. And as they start to look at our roadmap and the organic activity that we've got, they realize that they should be committing to us, because we will be able to help them not just only today, but out in the future. So that's how I see it. And obviously, as you mentioned, inorganic, obviously we continue, we've made a number of good acquisitions. They have been integrated into our portfolio as well. And that just adds to the breadth and depth of our technology and capability.\nTyler Radke: Thanks. And Nicole, as I look at the Q4 ACV guide. So obviously, it was a really strong beat here in Q3, but it looks like the race for the full year was much less than the operational beat in Q3, could you just help us understand what's giving you the moving pieces in the guide for Q4, where there's some deals that maybe came in a bit earlier here in Q3, are your kind of de- risking Q4 further based on what you see on the macro environment? Just help us understand the relatively large outperformance in Q3 and then the much smaller operational raise for the full year. Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, sure. Thanks. And great question, Tyler. So let me start with a perspective of how we view the overall momentum in our business. Our focus is really on how we improve our full year ACV outlook over time. And that's because the quarter-to-quarter revenue growth dynamics are really less indicative of momentum, because of the lumpiness of large deals. And also timing, the precision of predicting the timing within a specific quarter is also a little more challenging. For example, in Q3, we close over 12,000 deals in a quarter. So you can't always control the timing of when customers are deciding to close those deals. And so to illustrate the momentum we see in the business, I would point out two things. So first is looking at what we \u2013 what they started -- the answer was here I am looking at the raises throughout the year. So our $8 million operational raise that we gave in this guidance really is a follow on to a $29 million operational raise in August, which was a follow on to a $35 million operational raise in May. And so overall, we've seen consistent momentum and improvement in the business, that translated to about three points of incremental constant currency growth throughout the year. So from about 10%, in February, when we started to about 13% at the midpoint. The second thing that I'd point out is, while quarters are a little lumpy, and it's a little bit more challenging to see patterns, if you can look at kind of the first half and the second half to understand the underlying momentum of the business. So in the first half our constant currency ACV growth was around 12%. And if you look at the midpoint of our constant currency ACV growth implied in our guidance for the second half, that would be about 14 points. So you can clearly see from the first half to the second half the improvement in the momentum of the business. In addition, the incremental $8 million raise on top of the guidance we gave in August, it's an indicator of the overall improvement in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning, Ajei for you, first, you noted the breadth of the product line. And that for me raises the question of resource allocation to that greater breadth of portfolio specifically for R&D. At your analysts meeting five years ago, you gave us a number of priorities that you had for internal investing specifically for R&D. And here five years later looking ahead, given the greater breadth of the portfolio and the various dimensions you spoke of, how are you thinking about critical resource allocations, especially as R&D is steady or slightly higher percentage of revenues than it was a number of years ago. For you, Nicole. as follow up for the year-to-date, you've been adding typically between 100 and 200 employees per quarter. How are you thinking about the ongoing headcount adds from here, specifically in one of your largest categories, which is technical support and consulting, or the AE area?\nAjei Gopal: Hey. So let me start first, Jay, thank you for the question. Let's talk about a little bit about R&D and prioritization. As you know, and I think we've discussed this in our investor updates, we have a pretty robust mechanism of being able to allocate resources against priorities. And we do that analysis. And that ultimately influences where we're spending our money and our resources in order to achieve the outcomes that we're looking for. From a product perspective, I think you should understand that we look at sort of the core physics evolution, and there is an amount of work that we have focused on the evolution of the core physics, and that's algorithmic advances, all of the work that you would expect to continue to make structures better than ever, or fluids, the fluids better than ever electromagnetics, et cetera. So we have a stream of activity within the R&D organizations which do that. We also have, as we broaden the portfolio, we have some platform level work. And that really addresses the needs across multiple products. So it's a support for the cloud. It\u2019s support for products like Minerva, these are value propositions that apply across all of the physics and all of the verticals, as we deliver to our customers, the simulation platform that allows them to manage these really complex simulations that we're dealing with. If you look at technologies like materials, for example, that's again, very valid as you start to think about multi product sales materials comes in and provides a significant amount of capability in that context. So the other thing to note is that some of the techniques that we have developed, for example, GPU acceleration, where we've done some incredible work, that's technology that can be shared across the physics, some of the ray tracing techniques that we've developed, and once those are applicable across others, so we're leveraging the teams to be able to take advantage of learnings from one team to the other. So I'm very comfortable with our position with our R&D footprint, I think we have a fantastic roadmap. And I think it continues to add to the value proposition for our customers, which is we can continue to help them solve their most challenging problems now, and they have confidence in our roadmap, going into the future to support them. They understand the value proposition of being able to reduce costs, they understand we can help them reduce warranty costs. All of those things are reflected and supported by our R&D roadmap.\nNicole Anasenes: And, Jay, on your hiring question. Yes, our Q3 pace of hiring came in as expected, and it was at a slight -- it is at a higher rate than we did in Q3 2021. So we are keeping to our plans, we're tracking to our plans, we're continuing to hire in Q4 as planned. I mean, the overall additional point I would make is that our overall attrition still remains lower than industry averages. And that really positions us well to have the consistency and the stability in our overall organization to continue to invest in growth. And really in take advantage of the opportunities that Ajei just articulated in his response to you around your R&D question. And so we're continuing to execute against the 2022 hiring, as planned.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning. Appreciate it you guys have kind of over driven on the annual guide this year. I think that's something that it's pretty clear. So obviously, the trends through the third quarter here very strong, just still not kind of understanding what's going on in the fourth with the slowing growth on the ACV side. Is there something in the macro that is maybe some pull forward in the 3Q that made that look a little better? So the trend is still very strong. It's just that there's a little bit of lumpiness. I know, the backlog and the leading indicators were down, that's probably a Forex issue. But just trying to get a little more color on what's happening there in the fourth quarter, again, totally appreciating that the trendline is very strong. And you guys have done a great job this year of beating numbers consistently.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So first, I just kind of reiterate the point around growth rates in any given quarter, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I mean, the absolute growth rate in Q4 that you see in the underlying guidance, remember, there's about 700 basis points of foreign exchange in that absolute number overall. So when you adjust for foreign exchange, the midpoint is around that double digit growth, which is in line overall, with our model, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, you sometimes get lumpiness in terms of when deals happen, and when there's kind of year-to-year comparison of when those deals happen. So the quarterly growth rates in the patterns of quarterly growth rates are just less indicative of overall momentum than the overall which is why kind of in responding to Tyler, I kind of gave that description of the overall momentum and so now and when you look at what can happen in any given quarter again 12,000 contracts in a quarter. Sometimes timing isn't a different, it falls into different quarters and then one would expect and so overall, the underlying optimism the business had didn't change. The underlying momentum in the business hasn't changed. We have -- we are very focused on the full year, and delivering the full year number making sure that we're getting the right deals for our customers and for the business at the right time. And so sometimes that can affect the overall underlying dynamics environment growth. But overall, Q4 is midpoint, it is still in that 10% range, which is -- which brings the second half to approximately 14% constant currency.\nSteve Tusa: Right? And I guess just, yes, sorry, go ahead.\nNicole Anasenes: You had -- I didn't answer your backlog question. I apologize. So the backlog, on the backlog, that's really a sequential pattern as well. If you go back and you look, there's some seasonality to the way backlog kind of rolls off. And so that you also have to look into longer patterns as well. So if you look at the same quarters last year, you see that kind of seasonal pattern of the dip in backlog on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and then it kind of returns to different. So the quarter-to-quarter dynamics are less indicative of than the overall kind of full year dynamics that you see on backlog growth.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So there's really nothing that you guys are seeing. I know, everybody is very sensitive to the macro these days. But there's really nothing you're kind of seeing, as far as an extension of closed cycles or anything like that, where people are being just a little bit more cautious. Because the annual midpoint growth was on an organic basis was touched down a little bit, there's really nothing there, macro guys macro wise that you guys are seeing to just to put a cap on this question.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, no. I would say that the overall \u2013 over, I'll let Ajei comment because he's been speaking to customers. So he can give you the more contextual cover. But the overall, our overall outlook has improved since August. And so we're not seeing any fundamental difference other than the timing of when customers have closed deals in the quarter, so that on a constant currency basis, our growth rate is increased for the full year. And that's really driven by that $8 million operational rate. So there's nothing specific that we're seeing other than normal quarter-to-quarter dynamics in terms of when things close. But Ajei, maybe you can add some color.\nAjei Gopal: Yes, sure. Just to jump in here. Obviously, we read the same headlines that everyone else does. But look, our outlook is based on the reality that we're seeing in the field. And as I mentioned earlier, up in the last couple of months, I've had the opportunity to spend a fair amount of time on the road. And as I said earlier, I've talked to customers across in different geographies, I've also spent time with the sales force in the field, in these different geographies as well. And we're not seeing the challenges that you might read about in the headlines reflected in our business. And I will sound like a broken record. And forgive me for repeating myself. The value proposition that we provide is tied to R&D. And customers have multiyear R&D product roadmaps and the competitive environment for customers is more challenging today than it's ever been. And so they understand the lessons of the past, which is that if you see concerns in the headlines, then you pull your R&D investment back when those concerns are passed, you're now behind and you lose market share. And that's to your detriment. They've seen this play out time after time after time. And so the investment in R&D activity continues unabated. And our value proposition is tied to R&D, because of that said, again, repeatedly, we make R&D efficient, more efficient, and we help customers dry product to market faster. So that's where our excitement comes from. It comes from what we're seeing from forecasts perspective, what we're seeing from the field, what we're seeing with our customers, and the nature of the products in the market we serve.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities.\nBlair Abernethy: Thank you, nice quarter. Ajei, just wanted to ask you back to your prepared remarks around users of simulation software, if we look back a decade or so ago, really a very technical master's level or higher kind of user base was predominant. And now it seems like things are starting to broaden finally, as had been long predicted, is this -- are you seeing this actively out there across your verticals and what exactly do you see ANSYS doing in order to encourage broader engineering adoption?\nAjei Gopal: Well, it's multifaceted. I mean, firstly, the observation that you're making, which is that it's easier for engineers to use simulation and more engineers are using simulation is absolutely accurate. And there are a number of reasons why that's the case. Number one, we'll start from the product perspective. The products are easier to use. And we've had significant investments in usability, in integration, all of those things over the last several years after the last decade or two, which is culminated to the situation right now, where the product is so easy to use. I don't know if you recently that you saw this, it ran by my newsfeed this morning. But there was a high schooler in California, who used ANSYS simulation to simulate the loading of backpacks on students and the impact of a backpack. And they did that analysis using ANSYS simulation, they use granter, they use mechanical, they use a number of these products working together in order to come up with a with a solution and won a very prestigious award. That's an example of how easy the technology has been to -- has become to use for people where high schoolers are able to take, motivated high schoolers are able to take advantage of the technology. That's number one. Second thing is we continue to increase our level of investment with universities, we have presence in over 1,600 universities around the world. Cornell University teaches a massive online course using ANSYS, over a quarter of a million people have signed up for that. We've had millions of people downloading the student version of our products around the world. So there is broad based understanding of our technologies at the undergraduate level. And simulation is being taught as part of the curriculum. So graduating students are coming out aware of how to use simulation, aware of the value proposition, aware of the benefits, and aware of how to use ANSYS. And that is another aspect where the entering engineering workforce is very comfortable with this technology as opposed to a few decades ago. The other thing is, of course, the use of computing, we have continued to make the technology more efficient. We've also leveraging high performance computing, we're leveraging GPUs and with the overall broad-based availability of compute, that's making it easier for people to take advantage of simulation as well. So it's all of those things. It's work flows, its product capabilities, it\u2019s ease of use, it's integration with the academia, all of the availability computing, all of that is really exciting. And frankly, I would encourage all of you to go to the most to our website, we have a magazine called ANSYS Advantage. And the most recent one, for example, talks about some academic success stories. And that'll give you some perspective of how we're more deeply engaging with the academic community as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Hey, thanks for letting me ask a question here. Obviously, a good quarter, curious on kind of the linearity of strength. And then maybe if you were able to kind of discuss how things might be trending through October.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So Jason, can I just clarify your first question? I want to make sure I answer it correctly.\nJason Celino: Yes. So you talked about in earlier questions, you can't control when customers close deals. So I'm curious on the strength that you saw or the linearity of the activity through each month of the quarter.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, so I would say that, I mean, do you mean, in terms of when deals closed? I'd say that the linearity was somewhat more consistent, although I believe we saw a little bit more in the third month of the quarter. I'm just looking at the data here to make sure I've got it right. Yes, so we saw a little bit more in the third month of the quarter than we've seen it in prior quarters, but overall it's been largely consistent.\nJason Celino: Perfect. And then maybe just a quick housekeeping question. I think you made a small tuck-in acquisition, C&R Technologies. Again, small tuck-in, but how should we think about contribution for Q4, if there's any. Thanks.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, so C&R Technologies is closed yesterday November 1, let's check. Closed yesterday, and so we'll have $2 million I'm sorry, two months, not $2 million, two months of top line this year, it was a very, very small technology acquisition with a de minimis impact on the overall top line of the business. And maybe you could talk a little bit.\nAjei Gopal: Yes, just to jump in here. And while the transaction is obviously not material from a financial perspective, I just want to note that I'm really excited about the people who are joining the company as a result of joining ANSYS as a result of the acquisition of C&R. And, of course, the technology that C&R has built over the years. They're a leading provider of thermal analysis that used to optimize thermal systems. And they use in a number of applications, but most especially in the space in the satellite industry. So them -- their focus is on providing system level simulation for thermal and they've had a number of use cases. And they were, in fact being used as part of the James Webb telescope as well, where NASA use the C&R thermal desktop to provide a detailed thermal model of these optical and instrumentation systems. And it was used to predict things like transient profiles and gradients and heat flows as a payload transition from ambient to cryogenic conditions and back again. So by adding that to our portfolio, we will then be able to provide analysis to the customers, thermal analysis to customers from every stage from system design, all the way up to optimization from 1D tools, all the way up to 3D tools that gives us a comprehensive perspective. And then, of course, with the work that we're doing with space applications with a mission engineering suite of offerings. This further supports that and increases our competitiveness in that market as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg.\nAndrew DeGasperi : Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to maybe ask a question on the large number of automotive deals you saw in Q3. I think it's Germany, if I'm looking at the revenue mix. Just wondering given the news, we're hearing about that region. Can you elaborate how long were those deals in the making, and maybe tell us if the macro political situation there is accelerating some of these deal closures, given the energy issues there and things like that.\nAjei Gopal: Yes, so if I can jump in and give you some color on automotive, I don't have exactly the numbers in front of me. So I will have to be a little bit more qualitative. So one of the countries that I was in a few weeks ago was Germany, I did have a chance to meet with automotive customers there. And certainly I did an Asia as well in Japan. And obviously, I spent time with our teams. Look, again, it's the same value proposition that we're dealing with the automotive industry is looking at technologies like electrification, and they're recognizing that they need to make investments to be able to move more aggressively, and consider the future of their product lines and how they're going to evolve their product line. So that's one area. In autonomy, whilst it's true that full-fledged autonomy people are recognizing is a more difficult problem to solve. There is a tremendous amount of investment, certainly in making sure ADS happens, which is safety features. And so there continues to be investment in those areas. When you consider both electrification and autonomy, these are not traditional internal combustion engine, traditional views of how a car is built, these are incremental, different, it's a different approach. It's different skills. It's different tooling, it is different technologies. And as these companies are scaling up both the OEMs as well as the tier ones and the supply chain in general. They're facing pressures to start to think differently. And that's where simulation comes in. So we have an opportunity to continue to monetize those relationships and to continue to support our customers. And that's, I think, where we see strength in automotive.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And so just to give a little bit of color on the question you asked. The overall growth in EMEA was strong to reinforce Ajei\u2019s point or on the backup of that in automotive. Automotive was a strong quarter in EMEA. There were several seven figure sales automotive companies really focused on things that Ajei mentioned electrification and autonomous vehicle. But high tech, the high-tech industry was also an area of strength in Q3, which was an element of the performance around EMEA.\nKelsey DeBriyn : Hi, operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our question will come from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. It appears Ken has disconnected. And that will come from Adam Borg with Stifel.\nAdam Borg: Hey, guy, thanks so much for fitting me in. Maybe just a quick housekeeping item. I know earlier this year; you guys made a price increase. I think back in July. I was just curious. Maybe Nicole, you could help understand kind of what kind of benefit that had in the quarter? And how should we think about that in coming quarters?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we mentioned I think it was on the last call, we had done a strategic review of the portfolio to identify some targeted areas where we thought that the relative value that we provide versus the pricing in the market was maybe a little askew. And so we did some targeted price increases on a subset of elements of the portfolio in July. Now, just to provide some context. So the underlying yield from that is, of course, embedded in our guidance, because we did an in July. But what I would say is that even the price increase in July, our sales cycles tend to be three to six months long on average. And when you look at the larger deals that you see in Q4, many of those are -- you're starting those conversations in January. And so our expectation with that price increase is that it would have relatively less impact in 2022.\nOperator:\nKelsey DeBriyn: That's all the time we have today. I'm going to turn it over to Ajei for some closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thanks, Kelsey. I'm excited by our outstanding performance in Q3 and thus far in 2022, along with our robust pipeline and deep customer relationships. These factors, along with a diversified business and laser focus on execution are giving us momentum as we close out the year and move into 2023. And I'm confident in our ability to achieve the ambitious long-term goals we announced during our investor update. Thank you to my colleagues at ANSYS for your dedication to our customers and to advancing the state of art, save the art of simulation. And thank you all for attending today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line at this time.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Q3 was yet another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we once again beat across our key metrics, including ACV, revenue, operating margins and earnings per share. This gives us further confidence in the business and has enabled us to operationally raise our full year guidance for ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. As we have previously discussed the strength and the resilience of the ANSYS business come in part because of the number and the diversity of customers we serve, ANSYS has 10s of 1000s of customers across multiple industries, including high tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation. Those three sectors were again our largest contributors in Q3. Our largest contract for the quarter was in the high tech and semiconductor space, a $59 million three-year agreement with an international electronics company. This global brand has been challenged by the increasing complexity of its products, as semiconductor chips continue to get smaller, which has led to issues such as voltage drop. By continually enhancing our solution to semiconductor and other areas of physics, we will not only be able to stave off any competitive challenges in this long-term account, but we increase the number of ANSYS products the customer uses, the number of end users as well as the amount of computations performed. This new contract broadens our existing footprint, which included products from across our multi physics portfolio, such as structures, fluids, electromagnetics, and materials. This is a perfect example of a discussion at a recent investor update that ANSYS is growing across three vectors, more products, more users, and more computations. ANSYS is also well balanced across geographies, with a little less than 50% of our business coming from the Americas and the remainder roughly split between EMEA and Asia Pacific. This diversity in our customer base means that we can harness growth from a wide variety of sources. It also means that we are resilient to the business or economic dynamics of any specific customer or industry or country. In Q3, I'm excited to report that from a geographic perspective, we saw a very strong revenue growth from both Asia Pacific and EMEA while the Americas came in as expected. Adding to the strength of our business is a broad and deep product portfolio, which includes flagship product in structures, fluids, electromagnetics, semiconductors, optics and mission. As such, we are not over reliant on any individual product line, which further contributes to ANSYS\u2019 resilience. Additionally, our proven portfolio enables us to attract new customers, as well as to displace competitor technology. For example, our startup program is continuing to grow as these nascent companies take advantage of ANSYS solutions. The program has had over 1,600 customers across 53 countries. While members of our startup program represent a small piece of our overall business, they are aggressive users of our products. And with the program's high graduation rates, more and more of these customers become active contributors to the ANSYS business. While it can be difficult to replace an incumbent in our space, we have also grown our customer base by displacing competitors. For example, in Q3, we won a contract with an industrial tool manufacturer, that was a key account at one of our competitors. That customer is now using ANSYS\u2019 structural, fluids and electronic solutions for the development of its power tools. On these calls, I often highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several calls, I have discussed the unparalleled scalability of our best-in-class fluid products. I highlighted the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I discuss how customers are using our solutions in the development of next generation semiconductors. And I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. But this call, I would like to reiterate some of the key takeaways from a recent investor update. During the update in August, we discussed how typical enterprise software companies have only two vectors of growth, more products, and more users. ANSYS however, has a third, more computations, let me briefly discuss each of them. Traditionally, simulation involves a single user leveraging a single ANSYS product for each individual simulation. Today, as we partner with our customers to solve more complex R&D challenges, there is an increased demand for multiple physics, including structures and fluids, electronics, photonics and others to work together by transcending individual physics to connect workflows that solve complex multi physics problems. Our customers can simulate and analyze the physical world at a system and admission level. Addressing these complex new use cases inherently requires the use of multiple physics solvers, leading to an increased number of multi product sales. In Q3, we signed a seven-figure contract with a longtime Space 2.0 company that has standardized on ANSYS as multi physics solutions across all of its engineering departments to develop safer and more reliable launch vehicles. With this new agreement, the company is now expanding its ANSYS footprint to include our material intelligence solution as its central materials database. We have also invested in the overall user experience, which is driving more end users of ANSYS solutions. Remember that in the past, only expert engineering analysts could take advantage of simulation. Today, ANSYS simulation is being used by all levels of engineers, thanks to our automated workflows and integrations with other systems that make answer solutions more intuitive and easier to use. That means that different types of engineers can fully take advantage of the benefits of ANSYS simulation, and it is driving the expansion of simulation usage to more users upstream and downstream of the validation process. In Q3, ANSYS calls the largest healthcare contract in our history, a seven-figure agreement that will dramatically expand the number of users at an American eyecare company. realizing the benefits of simulation, this existing customer has launched a digital twin and digital engineering initiative that will triple the number of users of engineering simulation technology in the next 18 to 24 months. The third vector of our growth is through more computations. ANSYS is able to monetize customers workloads, as they run the larger, more complex calculations needed to solve next generation product challenges. A single ANSYS user can leverage multiple products and can run hundreds of simulations across 1000s of cores in parallel, which is critical functionality, as even the most common products become more complex. We provide our customers with open, scalable offerings, supported by the major cloud platforms to enhance and extend our industry leading simulation portfolio. This flexibility enables our customers to maximize the value they realize from simulation, while scaling up to address the increasing complexity of next generation product development. We recently announced the launch of our ANSYS Gateway powered by Amazon Web Services. With this addition to our comprehensive cloud offering, customers can easily access, subscribe and configure ANSYS applications from a single location. ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS allows broader access to high performance computing by bringing down the traditional hardware barriers that have limited innovation for many of our customers. Our focus on expanding the portfolio of physics on creating a platform to enable and manage complex multi physics solutions. And an expanding simulation use cases unlocks greater customer value, which enables all three vectors of growth for ANSYS. The application of ANSYS simulation technologies can be manifested in varied and distinct ways. For example, last time, I discussed the multiple roles ANSYS solutions played in the testing, launch and deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope. Keeping with the applications of ANSYS and space, I'd like to briefly highlight the role that we played in NASA's recent dark mission. As you may recall, in September, NASA smashed an unmanned spacecraft into an asteroid in an attempt to alter its orbit. The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab extensively used ANSYS SCK through a mission planning process from formulating darts trajectory through the asteroid system, as well as to visualize relevant vectors and attitudes. The thermal team use SCK\u2019s for mission environment when checking the location of the sun, relative to the satellite during critical maneuvers. NASA has announced that the dark mission exceeded its highest expectations by shortening the asteroids orbit by 32 minutes. This marks the first-time humanity has changed the orbit of a celestial object. And I would like to congratulate the team at Johns Hopkins and NASA for this success in this inspirational and potentially lifesaving mission. This example demonstrates the range of use cases, as well as the impact of ANSYS solutions. Next, I'd like to highlight 1000s of ANSYS employees around the world. They are of course, what makes ANSYS so special. So I'm very proud that Newsweek Magazine has ranked ANSYS as 13th amongst the most loved workplaces at US companies. The ranking considers employee survey responses, external ratings, and interviews with company leaders. This recognition is just one more testament to ANSYS\u2019 unique culture and the impact we have on the world. In closing, Q3 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, one that provides momentum as we close out the year, and look ahead to 2023. With our product leadership, proven performance and resilient business model, I'm more confident than ever in the future of ANSYS and the innovations, we're helping our customers to drive. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Gal, good morning. That's a great question. So the way you should think about how we monetize that is, it's really through product licensing. So when we license our technology to customers, we give them access to the use of us, take a multi-year lease as an example, we give them access to use our technology for a duration of time. And we also give them access to high performance computing capability. And that HPC translates into license software for us, license revenue for us or license ACV. And of course, access to the solvers themselves also show up as licenses. So in the aggregate, both the ability to use the technology on more processing translates into license for us. And the ability to use more of our software in that context translates into more license. So that's how we monetize it. And that's how it shows up in our financials. Why don\u2019t I jump in Gal, because I have some context. And then maybe I'll ask Nicole to add a little bit more. So if you look back at 2019, and you consider the evolution of our business, and we describe some of this in the investor update presentation that we did earlier this year, we've been in the process of a transformation in our business model, where we've been taking advantage of these three vectors of growth that you alluded to earlier. And we've been using that to really transform our business model in the way that we support our customers. So we've increased the amount of lease that we do with our customers. And that translates into obviously stickier relationships with our customers as we go forward. So look, at the end of the day, it comes down to the products that we have, and the capabilities that we provide and our ability to address some of our customers\u2019 most challenging market needs. And we have an amazing portfolio, we've continued to build in that portfolio, we've continued to expand that capability that makes it even more relevant for our customers today as compared with years ago. And the nature of the business model, the nature of the ability to monetize that relationship, all of that translate into our ability to be very resilient, no matter what happens out there in the market. So we have a very resilient business model that I'm excited about. We've talked about how we are and I mentioned this in my script, we talked about how our technology is very broad across multiple physics, we're not overly reliant on a single product line, we talked about how we're, we have presence in multiple industry verticals. And we mentioned, I mentioned high tech, I mentioned automotive, I mentioned aerospace as examples. And of course, we have presence in others. And we talked about our geographical distribution as well. So that gives us the ability to be resilient when a particular industry changes or when there are particular challenges in an individual market. Now, in the face of a global pandemic, of course, as you saw going through this, that's an overarching global phenomenon. And there, it just goes back to the core value proposition of our products, which is we help our customers build better products, bring them to market faster, at lower cost, we help them reduce warranty costs, we help them be more efficient. And so that combination of being able to support them from a top line perspective and drive both top line growth, as well as support them from a cost perspective really stands us in good stead in rough economic times, which is obviously what we've seen in the last couple of years. So that part, in part contributes to the momentum of the business that we've seen in the past. And frankly, that contributes to the momentum of the business that we're seeing, that we're seeing today. And I've had the opportunity to now spend a number of over the last couple of months, I've had an opportunity to spend time with customers in person in the US, in Europe, in Asia. And what I'm hearing from customers around the globe, is very consistent perspectives on the pressures that they're having to be able to continue to drive their businesses forward. So they've all got multiyear product roadmaps that they need to advance their businesses. And frankly, they're use-- they're relying on us. They're relying on simulation to be able to not only deliver on those roadmaps but to be able to deliver on those roadmaps as efficiently as possible. Because they know that simulation can help them save time and money through the avoidance of physical testing and things of that nature. So that's all contributed to the momentum that we have in the business. And I'm really excited about where we are right now. Yes, so firstly, Tyler, the first point is competitive displacements are in our industry relatively difficult, right? They don't happen. They don't happen on a regular basis. These are relatively difficult. And when they do happen, it's something that you are excited about because the customer has a specific need. And obviously, they're not able to satisfy that need, based on whatever products that may currently be using. And whatever they're using right now may or may not, if it's not able to address their needs, not able to solve their problems, not able to provide the level of fidelity or accuracy they're looking for, not able to integrate with the systems that they need to, they'll look for another solution. And as you rightly pointed out, we were excited. And I mentioned this in my script, we were excited about one of our competitive displacement this year, that we noted. But more generally, the nature of these displacements is driven by as you pointed out the strength of the portfolio. Look, we've made a lot of investment in improving the product from a performance perspective, from a usability perspective, from an integration perspective, if you look at some of the releases that we've announced, for example, most recently, in R3, in R2 in 2022 R2 one example on scalability. I mean, we're using a GPU scalability and achieving enormous acceleration in solving capacity for our customers. These are all incredible innovations that they value. And as they start to look at our roadmap and the organic activity that we've got, they realize that they should be committing to us, because we will be able to help them not just only today, but out in the future. So that's how I see it. And obviously, as you mentioned, inorganic, obviously we continue, we've made a number of good acquisitions. They have been integrated into our portfolio as well. And that just adds to the breadth and depth of our technology and capability. Hey. So let me start first, Jay, thank you for the question. Let's talk about a little bit about R&D and prioritization. As you know, and I think we've discussed this in our investor updates, we have a pretty robust mechanism of being able to allocate resources against priorities. And we do that analysis. And that ultimately influences where we're spending our money and our resources in order to achieve the outcomes that we're looking for. From a product perspective, I think you should understand that we look at sort of the core physics evolution, and there is an amount of work that we have focused on the evolution of the core physics, and that's algorithmic advances, all of the work that you would expect to continue to make structures better than ever, or fluids, the fluids better than ever electromagnetics, et cetera. So we have a stream of activity within the R&D organizations which do that. We also have, as we broaden the portfolio, we have some platform level work. And that really addresses the needs across multiple products. So it's a support for the cloud. It\u2019s support for products like Minerva, these are value propositions that apply across all of the physics and all of the verticals, as we deliver to our customers, the simulation platform that allows them to manage these really complex simulations that we're dealing with. If you look at technologies like materials, for example, that's again, very valid as you start to think about multi product sales materials comes in and provides a significant amount of capability in that context. So the other thing to note is that some of the techniques that we have developed, for example, GPU acceleration, where we've done some incredible work, that's technology that can be shared across the physics, some of the ray tracing techniques that we've developed, and once those are applicable across others, so we're leveraging the teams to be able to take advantage of learnings from one team to the other. So I'm very comfortable with our position with our R&D footprint, I think we have a fantastic roadmap. And I think it continues to add to the value proposition for our customers, which is we can continue to help them solve their most challenging problems now, and they have confidence in our roadmap, going into the future to support them. They understand the value proposition of being able to reduce costs, they understand we can help them reduce warranty costs. All of those things are reflected and supported by our R&D roadmap. Yes, sure. Just to jump in here. Obviously, we read the same headlines that everyone else does. But look, our outlook is based on the reality that we're seeing in the field. And as I mentioned earlier, up in the last couple of months, I've had the opportunity to spend a fair amount of time on the road. And as I said earlier, I've talked to customers across in different geographies, I've also spent time with the sales force in the field, in these different geographies as well. And we're not seeing the challenges that you might read about in the headlines reflected in our business. And I will sound like a broken record. And forgive me for repeating myself. The value proposition that we provide is tied to R&D. And customers have multiyear R&D product roadmaps and the competitive environment for customers is more challenging today than it's ever been. And so they understand the lessons of the past, which is that if you see concerns in the headlines, then you pull your R&D investment back when those concerns are passed, you're now behind and you lose market share. And that's to your detriment. They've seen this play out time after time after time. And so the investment in R&D activity continues unabated. And our value proposition is tied to R&D, because of that said, again, repeatedly, we make R&D efficient, more efficient, and we help customers dry product to market faster. So that's where our excitement comes from. It comes from what we're seeing from forecasts perspective, what we're seeing from the field, what we're seeing with our customers, and the nature of the products in the market we serve. Well, it's multifaceted. I mean, firstly, the observation that you're making, which is that it's easier for engineers to use simulation and more engineers are using simulation is absolutely accurate. And there are a number of reasons why that's the case. Number one, we'll start from the product perspective. The products are easier to use. And we've had significant investments in usability, in integration, all of those things over the last several years after the last decade or two, which is culminated to the situation right now, where the product is so easy to use. I don't know if you recently that you saw this, it ran by my newsfeed this morning. But there was a high schooler in California, who used ANSYS simulation to simulate the loading of backpacks on students and the impact of a backpack. And they did that analysis using ANSYS simulation, they use granter, they use mechanical, they use a number of these products working together in order to come up with a with a solution and won a very prestigious award. That's an example of how easy the technology has been to -- has become to use for people where high schoolers are able to take, motivated high schoolers are able to take advantage of the technology. That's number one. Second thing is we continue to increase our level of investment with universities, we have presence in over 1,600 universities around the world. Cornell University teaches a massive online course using ANSYS, over a quarter of a million people have signed up for that. We've had millions of people downloading the student version of our products around the world. So there is broad based understanding of our technologies at the undergraduate level. And simulation is being taught as part of the curriculum. So graduating students are coming out aware of how to use simulation, aware of the value proposition, aware of the benefits, and aware of how to use ANSYS. And that is another aspect where the entering engineering workforce is very comfortable with this technology as opposed to a few decades ago. The other thing is, of course, the use of computing, we have continued to make the technology more efficient. We've also leveraging high performance computing, we're leveraging GPUs and with the overall broad-based availability of compute, that's making it easier for people to take advantage of simulation as well. So it's all of those things. It's work flows, its product capabilities, it\u2019s ease of use, it's integration with the academia, all of the availability computing, all of that is really exciting. And frankly, I would encourage all of you to go to the most to our website, we have a magazine called ANSYS Advantage. And the most recent one, for example, talks about some academic success stories. And that'll give you some perspective of how we're more deeply engaging with the academic community as well. Yes, just to jump in here. And while the transaction is obviously not material from a financial perspective, I just want to note that I'm really excited about the people who are joining the company as a result of joining ANSYS as a result of the acquisition of C&R. And, of course, the technology that C&R has built over the years. They're a leading provider of thermal analysis that used to optimize thermal systems. And they use in a number of applications, but most especially in the space in the satellite industry. So them -- their focus is on providing system level simulation for thermal and they've had a number of use cases. And they were, in fact being used as part of the James Webb telescope as well, where NASA use the C&R thermal desktop to provide a detailed thermal model of these optical and instrumentation systems. And it was used to predict things like transient profiles and gradients and heat flows as a payload transition from ambient to cryogenic conditions and back again. So by adding that to our portfolio, we will then be able to provide analysis to the customers, thermal analysis to customers from every stage from system design, all the way up to optimization from 1D tools, all the way up to 3D tools that gives us a comprehensive perspective. And then, of course, with the work that we're doing with space applications with a mission engineering suite of offerings. This further supports that and increases our competitiveness in that market as well. Yes, so if I can jump in and give you some color on automotive, I don't have exactly the numbers in front of me. So I will have to be a little bit more qualitative. So one of the countries that I was in a few weeks ago was Germany, I did have a chance to meet with automotive customers there. And certainly I did an Asia as well in Japan. And obviously, I spent time with our teams. Look, again, it's the same value proposition that we're dealing with the automotive industry is looking at technologies like electrification, and they're recognizing that they need to make investments to be able to move more aggressively, and consider the future of their product lines and how they're going to evolve their product line. So that's one area. In autonomy, whilst it's true that full-fledged autonomy people are recognizing is a more difficult problem to solve. There is a tremendous amount of investment, certainly in making sure ADS happens, which is safety features. And so there continues to be investment in those areas. When you consider both electrification and autonomy, these are not traditional internal combustion engine, traditional views of how a car is built, these are incremental, different, it's a different approach. It's different skills. It's different tooling, it is different technologies. And as these companies are scaling up both the OEMs as well as the tier ones and the supply chain in general. They're facing pressures to start to think differently. And that's where simulation comes in. So we have an opportunity to continue to monetize those relationships and to continue to support our customers. And that's, I think, where we see strength in automotive. Thanks, Kelsey. I'm excited by our outstanding performance in Q3 and thus far in 2022, along with our robust pipeline and deep customer relationships. These factors, along with a diversified business and laser focus on execution are giving us momentum as we close out the year and move into 2023. And I'm confident in our ability to achieve the ambitious long-term goals we announced during our investor update. Thank you to my colleagues at ANSYS for your dedication to our customers and to advancing the state of art, save the art of simulation. And thank you all for attending today's call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and full year 2022. The third quarter demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and better than our guidance, revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded our Q3 guidance driven by ACV outperformance. Both our large enterprise customers and SMB customers performed well during the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Q3 ACV was $409.3 million and grew year-over-year 12% or 20% in constant currency. We saw broad base constant currency growth across customer types, geographies and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 16% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. ACV from recurring sources represented 79% of the total in the third quarter. Q3 total Revenue was $473.7 million and grew 6% or 15% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance driven by outperforming our expected ACV. Asia Pacific and EMEA drove strong Q3 revenue growth. We had robust top line performance in Q3 with ACV and revenue both growing double digit in constant currency at 20% and 15%, respectively. In both Q3 and year-to-date, we executed against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We close the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of over $1.1 billion, which grew 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 91.1% and an operating margin of 41%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue, as well as the timing of investments that have moved into the fourth quarter of the year. The result with third quarter EPS of $1.77, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 18%. The tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our operating cash flows in the third quarter totaled $127.2 million. Our unlevered operating cash flows were $132 million. We ended the quarter with $632.7 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. We delivered a robust Q3 and our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. Offsetting our year-to-date performance and strong full year outlook is persistent and significant US dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rates embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We expect full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1,975 million to $2 billion, which represents growth of 5.6% to 6.9% or 12% to 13.4% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our full year constant currency ACV growth compared to our August guidance. For additional context, the midpoint of our ACV guidance when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates would be equal to approximately $2,080 million and would exceed our 2019 investor day ACV targets. Our full year constant currency ACV growth raise is driven by the strong performance and our resilient business model. That performance drove a full year ACV operational increase of $8 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $20 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. Our strong performance has been consistent throughout 2022. Since we issued full year ACV guidance in February, we have raised the midpoint of our constant currency growth rate guidance by almost three points from around 10% in February to almost 13%, constant currency growth with our current guidance. The strong organic growth in our business has been driving our improving outlook. Turning to revenue, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2 billion to $2,035 million which is growth of 3.55 to 5.4%, or 10.1% to 11.9% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth compared to our August guidance, which reflects a full year revenue operational increase of $12 million. This momentum was offset by $24 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. Similar to ACV, for revenue, we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2022 constant currency growth rate guidance by almost two points from around 9% in February to 11% with our current guidance. Turning to EPS, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.48 to $7.80. Relative to our August guidance, our full year EPS increased $0.12 from better operational performance, which was offset by $0.17 of incremental foreign exchange headwind. As a reminder, some of our strong Q3 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our full year operating margins to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $600 million. Relative to our August guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $2 million from better operational performance, which was offset by $7 million of incremental foreign exchange headwind. Also note on a year-over-year basis, operating cash flow continues to face nonoperational headwinds, including the timing impact of R&D capitalization regulations, and higher interest expense given rising interest rates. Since January 2022, we have seen significant US dollar strengthening relative to all global currencies that contribute to our results. Our largest exposures are to the euro and Japanese yen. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $120 million, and operating cash flow by approximately 40 million. Now, let me turn to guidance for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $761.3 million to $786.3 million, and revenue in the range of $621.8 million to $656.8 million. We expect Q4 operating margin in the range of 45.6% to 48.5%, and EPS in the range of $2.58 to $2.90. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q4 are contained in the prepared remarks document. Our core simulation market is strong and diversified with consistent demand from our customers as they encounter increasingly complex product development challenges. This strong core market, coupled with our market leading portfolio, deep customer relationships, and highly recurring financial model with three vectors of growth, makes ANSYS\u2019 business highly resilient. All of this is driving the underlying momentum in our business and gives us confidence in the increased outlook for full year constant currency ACV and revenue growth. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for their outstanding execution during the quarter, which drove a robust Q3 financial performance and momentum going into our last quarter of the year. We once again delivered an exceptional quarter which demonstrated the ongoing strength of the ANSYS business. I am confident in our ability to continue to execute against our outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions. Yes, sure. Thanks. And great question, Tyler. So let me start with a perspective of how we view the overall momentum in our business. Our focus is really on how we improve our full year ACV outlook over time. And that's because the quarter-to-quarter revenue growth dynamics are really less indicative of momentum, because of the lumpiness of large deals. And also timing, the precision of predicting the timing within a specific quarter is also a little more challenging. For example, in Q3, we close over 12,000 deals in a quarter. So you can't always control the timing of when customers are deciding to close those deals. And so to illustrate the momentum we see in the business, I would point out two things. So first is looking at what we \u2013 what they started -- the answer was here I am looking at the raises throughout the year. So our $8 million operational raise that we gave in this guidance really is a follow on to a $29 million operational raise in August, which was a follow on to a $35 million operational raise in May. And so overall, we've seen consistent momentum and improvement in the business, that translated to about three points of incremental constant currency growth throughout the year. So from about 10%, in February, when we started to about 13% at the midpoint. The second thing that I'd point out is, while quarters are a little lumpy, and it's a little bit more challenging to see patterns, if you can look at kind of the first half and the second half to understand the underlying momentum of the business. So in the first half our constant currency ACV growth was around 12%. And if you look at the midpoint of our constant currency ACV growth implied in our guidance for the second half, that would be about 14 points. So you can clearly see from the first half to the second half the improvement in the momentum of the business. In addition, the incremental $8 million raise on top of the guidance we gave in August, it's an indicator of the overall improvement in the second half. And, Jay, on your hiring question. Yes, our Q3 pace of hiring came in as expected, and it was at a slight -- it is at a higher rate than we did in Q3 2021. So we are keeping to our plans, we're tracking to our plans, we're continuing to hire in Q4 as planned. I mean, the overall additional point I would make is that our overall attrition still remains lower than industry averages. And that really positions us well to have the consistency and the stability in our overall organization to continue to invest in growth. And really in take advantage of the opportunities that Ajei just articulated in his response to you around your R&D question. And so we're continuing to execute against the 2022 hiring, as planned. Yes. So first, I just kind of reiterate the point around growth rates in any given quarter, on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I mean, the absolute growth rate in Q4 that you see in the underlying guidance, remember, there's about 700 basis points of foreign exchange in that absolute number overall. So when you adjust for foreign exchange, the midpoint is around that double digit growth, which is in line overall, with our model, on a quarter-to-quarter basis, you sometimes get lumpiness in terms of when deals happen, and when there's kind of year-to-year comparison of when those deals happen. So the quarterly growth rates in the patterns of quarterly growth rates are just less indicative of overall momentum than the overall which is why kind of in responding to Tyler, I kind of gave that description of the overall momentum and so now and when you look at what can happen in any given quarter again 12,000 contracts in a quarter. Sometimes timing isn't a different, it falls into different quarters and then one would expect and so overall, the underlying optimism the business had didn't change. The underlying momentum in the business hasn't changed. We have -- we are very focused on the full year, and delivering the full year number making sure that we're getting the right deals for our customers and for the business at the right time. And so sometimes that can affect the overall underlying dynamics environment growth. But overall, Q4 is midpoint, it is still in that 10% range, which is -- which brings the second half to approximately 14% constant currency. You had -- I didn't answer your backlog question. I apologize. So the backlog, on the backlog, that's really a sequential pattern as well. If you go back and you look, there's some seasonality to the way backlog kind of rolls off. And so that you also have to look into longer patterns as well. So if you look at the same quarters last year, you see that kind of seasonal pattern of the dip in backlog on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and then it kind of returns to different. So the quarter-to-quarter dynamics are less indicative of than the overall kind of full year dynamics that you see on backlog growth. Yes, no. I would say that the overall \u2013 over, I'll let Ajei comment because he's been speaking to customers. So he can give you the more contextual cover. But the overall, our overall outlook has improved since August. And so we're not seeing any fundamental difference other than the timing of when customers have closed deals in the quarter, so that on a constant currency basis, our growth rate is increased for the full year. And that's really driven by that $8 million operational rate. So there's nothing specific that we're seeing other than normal quarter-to-quarter dynamics in terms of when things close. But Ajei, maybe you can add some color. Yes. So Jason, can I just clarify your first question? I want to make sure I answer it correctly. Yes, so I would say that, I mean, do you mean, in terms of when deals closed? I'd say that the linearity was somewhat more consistent, although I believe we saw a little bit more in the third month of the quarter. I'm just looking at the data here to make sure I've got it right. Yes, so we saw a little bit more in the third month of the quarter than we've seen it in prior quarters, but overall it's been largely consistent. Yes, so C&R Technologies is closed yesterday November 1, let's check. Closed yesterday, and so we'll have $2 million I'm sorry, two months, not $2 million, two months of top line this year, it was a very, very small technology acquisition with a de minimis impact on the overall top line of the business. And maybe you could talk a little bit. Yes. And so just to give a little bit of color on the question you asked. The overall growth in EMEA was strong to reinforce Ajei\u2019s point or on the backup of that in automotive. Automotive was a strong quarter in EMEA. There were several seven figure sales automotive companies really focused on things that Ajei mentioned electrification and autonomous vehicle. But high tech, the high-tech industry was also an area of strength in Q3, which was an element of the performance around EMEA. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we mentioned I think it was on the last call, we had done a strategic review of the portfolio to identify some targeted areas where we thought that the relative value that we provide versus the pricing in the market was maybe a little askew. And so we did some targeted price increases on a subset of elements of the portfolio in July. Now, just to provide some context. So the underlying yield from that is, of course, embedded in our guidance, because we did an in July. But what I would say is that even the price increase in July, our sales cycles tend to be three to six months long on average. And when you look at the larger deals that you see in Q4, many of those are -- you're starting those conversations in January. And so our expectation with that price increase is that it would have relatively less impact in 2022."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President, Investor Relations. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. DeBriyn for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our second quarter 2022 Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q3 and updated fiscal year 2022 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Important factors that may affect our future results are discussed in our public filings. Forward-looking statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligation to update any such information. During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q2 was yet another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we once again beat across our key metrics including revenue, ACV, operating margin and earnings per share. That, coupled with our healthy pipeline, gives us further confidence in the business and has enabled us to raise our full year guidance on ACV and revenue in constant currency. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. Our largest contract of the quarter was a three-year, nearly $25 million agreement with an international electronics brand. This new contract includes ANSYS solutions for semiconductors, electronics, fluids, as well as our Learning Hub to make users more familiar and productive with our software. By standardizing on ANSYS solutions, this customer expects to increase its products yield while decreasing verification time for signal and power integrity. Another multimillion-dollar agreement in Q2 enables an international automotive OEM to expand its usage to include ANSYS solutions for enterprise-level materials intelligence, electromagnetic interference and autonomous driving. This customer has already realized up to 5x improvements in aerodynamics and thermal engineering productivity, a reduction of more than 40% in material properties acquisition costs and a 10% improvement in hydrogen storage for its fuel cells. From a geographical perspective, we saw strong revenue growth from Asia Pacific and EMEA and the Americas came in as expected. Our 36% constant currency growth in revenue in Asia Pacific was thanks to several large contracts, including one with Murata Manufacturing, a Japanese company that specializes in electronic components. With Murata, the multiyear agreement spans our multiphysics portfolio and provides the company with an important thermal aware system simulation flow for radio frequency modules. This solution is expected to provide faster thermal sign-off by reducing the number of redesigns and by improving the ease of use of ANSYS products through a single interface. From an industry perspective, the high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. We also saw continued strength in the energy space, reflecting a mix of traditional and renewable use cases as well as in the industrial equipment sector, where we recorded a number of multiyear agreements from companies around the world. For example, longtime customer WEG, a global leader in electrical engineering, power and automation technology signed a multiyear contract in Q2 to standardize on ANSYS simulation. This new agreement will help the Brazilian company rethink its product development process by creating and implementing digital twins of its motors. This agreement will drive WEG's electrification and green energy initiatives. Now I'd like to briefly mention a different kind of customer success story. I would like to congratulate NASA and Northrop Grumman on the success of the James Webb Space Telescope. We have all seen the stunning images that have come from this largest and most precise optical instrument ever developed, and we are proud here at ANSYS for the role that we played in its creation. Naturally, it was impossible to physically test the entire mission before launch. And given the unforgiving environment of space, the mission had to run as expected the first time. Any era would have cost billions of dollars in expenses with perhaps an even greater scientific loss. That is why the team developed the rocket, the telescope and the entire mission in part using ANSYS simulation. With ANSYS, engineers overcame a number of unique challenges, including folding a structure of the size of a tennis court into a rocket, and then unfolding it. And then understanding how perpetual solar radiation would affect its operations. Engineers use ANSYS mechanical to identify solutions to ensure the satellites' connected segment and mirror would behave the same way of monolithic mirror would. Our optical solutions were used to design and test each step in the mirror alignment process from the initial segment search to the final phasing. In addition, Mission Planer has used our digital mission engineering solutions to test variables that impact how the satellite is launched and to determine how to keep the satellite stationary 1 million miles from Earth. And the results, well they're simply out of this world. Turning to our leadership in solutions to multiphysics simulation. Our customers now have access to ANSYS 2022 Release 2, a comprehensive set of solutions and capabilities that cross physics, engineering disciplines and industries. Included in this release are machine learning techniques in our core products, which are automatically optimizing repetitive processes, predicting workflows and enhancing user productivity. We have also delivered artificial intelligence technology that enables customers to perform massive design optimization studies to arrive at an optimal design in a fraction of the time once required. This release also provides new high-performance computing capabilities and custom workflows for industry-specific applications, which will help more users address computationally complex problems by examining the impact of multiple physics at the same time. This added functionality is extending our multiphysics leadership, while enabling customers to make their next-generation products a reality. I am also excited that TSMC recently certified ANSYS' Power Integrity software for its industry-leading N4P and N3E process technologies. The certification for ANSYS RedHawk SC and ANSYS Totem enables next-generation silicon designs for machine learning, connectivity and high-performance computing applications. I'm also pleased to announce that ANSYS has joined the Intel Foundry Services Cloud Alliance. Our electronics and semiconductor suite, which includes ANSYS RedHawk SC, ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RaptorX, are available as part of the design flow that will help enable Intel customers to enhance their productivity. Rounding out our partner updates, Samsung Foundry has announced that it is using ANSYS' industry-leading multiphysics solutions to develop designs on the most advanced chips, nodes and process technologies. Using ANSYS, Samsung Foundry will deliver a comprehensive design flow with greater capacity, speed and integration capabilities for the company's most advanced semiconductor technology to boost high-speed connectivity while helping to reduce design error and risk. On our last call, I discussed the role that ANSYS solutions are playing in our customers' sustainability initiatives, including for increasing fuel efficiency, in driving electrification and in decreasing the rate of emissions. We have recently created a cross-functional Center of Excellence composed of members of our development and consulting teams to advance sustainability initiatives for our customers and partners. Our subject matter experts are focused on how ANSYS simulation can help accelerate the creation of new, more efficient and lower-impact products beginning at the design and development phase. As part of our own sustainability endeavors, ANSYS is committed to reducing our environmental footprint. To that end, we have announced that we have set a 15% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2027. To hit that target, we are implementing projects identified in energy audits, including lighting enhancements and on-site renewable energy. We recently submitted to the Carbon Disclosure Project for the third year in a row, and continue to enhance our task force on climate-related financial disclosures. I am also excited to announce that Fast Company has recognized several ANSYS employees with its world-changing Ideas Award for the ANSYS Minerva template. This template is built in our Minerva solution for simulation process and data management, and provides an FDA guided approval process for medical devices to speed potentially life-saving products to patients more quickly. I'm also proud that ANSYS has been certified as the Most Loved Workplace by the Best Practice Institute. This honor was bestowed on ANSYS because of our collaboration, our corporate values and practices as well as the outcomes we drive and demonstrates why we are an employer of choice. Next week, we'll have an opportunity to discuss ANSYS' longer-term business and financial goals as part of our investor update. I'm looking forward to further explaining the expansive role that simulation is playing in product development and sharing with you how ANSYS has become a trusted business partner with some of the top brands around the world. To summarize, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance across all key metrics. Our business momentum, our expanded product leadership and the ongoing strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in our ability to meet our outlook for 2022. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and full year 2022. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and better than our guidance. Revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q2 guidance, driven by ACV outperformance and the mix of license types sold in the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was $460.3 million and grew year-over-year 7% or 13% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across all geographic regions and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 14% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. ACV from recurring sources represented 81% of the total in the second quarter. Q2 total revenue was $475.9 million and grew 5% or 12% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by outperforming our expected ACV. Asia Pacific and EMEA drove strong Q2 revenue growth. We had robust top line performance in Q2, with ACV and revenue both growing double digit in constant currency at 13% and 12%, respectively. In both Q2 and the first half, we executed against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of almost $1.2 billion, which grew 27% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 40.7%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue as well as the timing of investments that have moved into the second half of the year. The result was second quarter EPS of $1.77, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our cash flow from operations in the second quarter totaled $118.9 million, which benefited from continued strong collections. We ended the quarter with $517.6 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. We delivered a robust Q2, and our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. However, offsetting our first half performance and strong full year outlook is continued and significant U.S. dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rates embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 1.6 points of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.98 billion to $2.020 billion. This represents growth of 5.8% to 8%, or 11.3% to 13.5% in constant currency and a midpoint of $2 billion, which puts us on track to achieve the 2019 Investor Day target. For additional context, the $2 billion midpoint of our ACV guidance when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates would equal approximately $2.07 billion and would exceed our 2019 Investor Day ACV target. Our full year ACV raise is driven by the strong performance we saw in Q2 and improved forecast and momentum we see in the business, especially for Q3. That underlying improvement drove a full year ACV operational increase of $29 million relative to our May guidance. This operational momentum was offset by $19 million of foreign exchange headwind. Turning to revenue. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.005 billion to $2.055 billion, which is growth of 3.8% to 6.4% or 9.2% to 11.8% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by one point of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance. This raise is driven by the strong revenue performance we saw in Q2 and improved forecast we see for the rest of the year. That underlying improvement drove a full year revenue operational increase of $18 million relative to our May guidance. This operational momentum was offset by $23 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.50 to $7.88. Relative to our May guidance, our full year EPS increased $0.07 from better operational performance, which was offset by $0.12 of foreign exchange headwind. As a reminder, some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year. We continue to expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Given the rapidly changing interest rate environment, we thought it would be helpful to provide full year interest expense for your modeling purposes. As a reminder, our term loan structure has floating interest rates and rising interest rates will continue to impact interest expense. Our current outlook projects our full year 2022 interest expense to be $22 million, up almost $10 million from last year. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $610 million. Relative to our May guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $6 million from better operational performance, which was offset by $6 million of foreign exchange headwind. Also note on a year-over-year basis operating cash flow continues to face nonoperational headwinds, including the timing impact of R&E capitalization regulations and higher interest expense, given rising interest rates. Since January 2022, we have seen significant U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and Japanese yen. The trajectory of the movement of these currencies has been outsized relative to typical currency fluctuation impacts. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $100 million and an operating cash flow by approximately $35 million. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business is operationally strong and has considerable momentum. Now let me turn to guidance for Q3. For the third quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $392 million to $412 million and revenue in the range of $455 million to $475 million. Our outlook implies double-digit ACV constant currency growth for Q3 and the full year 2022, in line with our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We expect Q3 operating margin in the range of 37.8% to 39.4% and EPS in the range of $1.56 to $1.70. Further details around specific currency rates, interest expense and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q3 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast, diversified business model and high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum of our business. This is reflected in the increased outlook for constant currency ACV and revenue growth and the operational improvements in our cash flow outlook. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your outstanding execution in the quarter, which drove our robust Q2 financial performance and continued momentum going into the second half of the year. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales forecast, demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook as well as our long-term strategy. I am more confident than ever in our future. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Wong with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess what I wanted to just kind of check into is just the commentary that you guys both provided very strong, very robust. As far as macro goes, just wondering what type of macro environment are you predicting for the second half as we think about this -- the elevated guide?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. Thanks for your question, Ken. So yes, as we pointed out, as we pointed out in our guidance, we have -- we are seeing -- we're really seeing underlying strong momentum in the business. The beat to the Q2 numbers was really kind of evidence of continuing broad-based building pipeline. And as we -- now that we're in the second half of the year, we have a much clearer visibility to kind of what that second half pipeline looks like and kind of how it will land over the next couple of quarters. And while we're certainly very sensitized to the macro environment overall and what's occurring with the rest of the tech industry, our business is highly exposed to R&D. And as you recall, R&D is usually the last thing to go off and the first thing to come back on when they're tightening. And so we're just not seeing the same level of constraint that may be some other parts of the tech sector are seeing. And the outlook of our guidance really reflects the broad-based demand across industries, geographies and customer segments that we saw in Q2 and that we kind of see coming into the pipeline in the back half of the year.\nAjei Gopal: Just to amplify the point that Nicole was making, I mean, many of our customers they're certainly aware of these broader geopolitical concerns and pressures that we all see, but they continue to face competitive pressures. And they've got multiyear product road maps that they've been driving. And frankly, that's where simulation comes in. Simulation helps them to deal with some of the competitive pressures that they're dealing with. It allows them to innovate more rapidly. And at the same time, it allows them to save money and time because we can reduce reliance on physical testing, we can reduce warranty costs and so forth. And so the value proposition for simulation, which is it helps our customers both drive top line growth as well as achieve bottom line savings, that value proposition is really a compelling value proposition, and that's, I think, what we're seeing in the market.\nKen Wong: Got it. And if I could maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Ajei. Look, you highlighted areas of strength from a verticals perspective, auto, aero. Tech remain really strong. Are there any end markets that you feel maybe are still catching up to some of their peers in terms of maybe seeing heavier COVID or macro pressures that could potentially kind of open up as macro does improve?\nAjei Gopal: No. I think -- as I said in the comments, our performance was pretty consistent across the verticals as we expected to see. Certainly, the bigger verticals are high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, automotive and ground transportation, but we saw strength in other areas as well. So nothing specifically to note in terms of explicit areas of consideration or concern.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I guess a question on seasonality in the business. I think in the past, you've talked about maybe ANSYS increasingly having a skew of -- into 4Q, just given ACV generation with bigger enterprise customers signing multiyear agreements. Just given where the guidance stands currently, it looks like a really strong 3Q and then proportionately less coming from 4Q relative to a year ago. Is that in any way reflecting SMB versus enterprise activity? Or is it maybe just leaving you some wiggle room or cushion to get 3Q under your belt and then have more visibility on 4Q?\nNicole Anasenes: Joe, thanks for the question. So how I would characterize the second half guidance is just much clearer visibility to where deals land. As you know, we've transitioned to a multiyear lease subscription model over the past couple of years. And so as you move into that multiyear lease model, your kind of timing of when the renewal base happens both within the quarter and across the quarters and within the years, can start to shift over time. And so I would characterize the second half as the kind of clearest visibility we have from where we're sitting today, which is quite clear once you get into the second half because your sales cycles tend to be three to six months long. So you have a little bit more clarity in terms of what the timing of those things may line up to. So I would characterize it -- I think it's maybe a little bit slightly -- it's slightly stronger from a growth rate standpoint. I think the overall skew is pretty similar to prior quarters. It might be a little bit heavier weighted into Q3 than maybe last year. But I would characterize it as kind of a reflection of the timing of the yield of the pipeline we see today with a slightly stronger Q4 growth rate as a result of the year-to-year compare.\nAjei Gopal: And operationally, when you think about it, I mean the sales team manages relationships with the customers. And obviously, as Nicole said, there's a lot of timing around that in terms of when projects are kicked off in activity. So that drives the timing of some of the larger deals as well.\nJoe Vruwink: And  nothing specific to your SMB customer base, if there's been maybe one takeaway this earnings season, there's maybe initial indications of moderation as opposed to enterprise being quite strong. But nothing in your kind of forecast that would call out one segment versus the other?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. No. I mean what -- the kind of -- the SMB customer base is reflected in kind of our geography and momentum. Momentum accounts primarily continue to be consistent in what they deliver. They're consistent with what we expected coming into the year. The second half pipeline is consistent with what we would have expected to see. And when you look again at the mix of Q3 versus Q4 ACV, I mean they're pretty close in terms of percentages. So in terms of the percentage of ACV that occurred last year versus this year, the growth rates again might be a little bit skewed.\nJoe Vruwink: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, in your prepared remarks, you gave some examples of multi-solution sales with some of the larger transactions. And of course, that's been going on for some time now. When you look at your pipeline for the remainder of the year or for the next 12 months, could you comment on that multi-solutions component of the pipeline? And within that, I'd be especially interested in anything you're seeing in terms of incremental demand or contribution from any role of Minerva, the materials business, which you highlighted. And any of the other more recent acquisitions such as Phoenix and MST and [Miracle], then I have a follow-up.\nAjei Gopal: So Jay, as you know, I mean, we've been on this journey towards multiphysics sales quite for some time now, and we continue to execute along that direction as you pointed out. And certainly, our pipeline, especially as you consider the larger enterprise customers, our pipeline very much includes solutions that comprise of products from multiple parts of our portfolio. And so the multiphysics message is strong. It addresses what customers are looking for. We have been a pioneer in that space, and we continue to see benefit from that, and we certainly see traction from customers as we continue to support them. So absolutely, as we look ahead, we have multiphysics activity and multiple product sales into our customer base, certainly at the larger end, but it's also increasingly -- as you start to look down the pyramid, we see multiphysics capabilities penetrating into the customer base. So I think that's very important. You mentioned a couple of product lines. Obviously, we don't give quantitative breakouts by products, but I can give you some qualitative color. You asked about Minerva. I gave you, I think in the script, I mentioned some of the workflows that we've put in place in the health care area. Minerva continues to be an important aspect managing simulation data given the amount of simulation information that's being created by our customers, managing that simulation data effectively is important, and that's -- Minerva plays a role in that. Materials, I've also mentioned -- and I think I mentioned in a couple of places, certainly in the past couple of calls, materials is also important, and we certainly recognize customers as they start to go through design optimization opportunities the choice of materials is really important. Materials plays another interesting role in sustainability as well because when you consider the long-term compliance with regulations about materials that could be used, understanding the materials within our product design, something which could potentially take a number of years from design into actual implementation, really understanding what's in the product that's being built to make sure that you're compliant with the most recent regulations, that's also important. And so that's another area where materials comes in. Model basis and engineering, we continue to make progress in that area. It's really across the board where we have been able to have -- build on the strength of our ANSYS, traditional ANSYS products. We've supplemented that with acquisitions as and when appropriate, as it makes sense given our strategy. And we've continued to build the portfolio out to something that I'm very excited about and I know our customers are very excited about.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Nicole, you made the interesting point that at 2019 rates your 2022 ACV guidance would be $2.07 billion, which would imply a three-year CAGR for ACV at constant currency of about 12%. Maybe we'll talk about this next week on the investor call. But is that, do you think, a sustainable ACV CAGR for the next number of years? Or if it were to accelerate, what would be the catalyst for that?\nNicole Anasenes: Thanks, Jay. Yes. So as you pointed out, we have our investor update scheduled for next week. We're really looking forward to sharing that long-term guidance with you next week. But what I -- so I can't comment about the future. But certainly, it's not too long before we can comment on the future. So stay tuned. But yes, I mean what we have stated and what we continue to be confident in is a business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. I think if you look at the course of this year, we have consistently delivered it in the second quarter in the half -- in our outlook for the second half of the year. We're squarely on that model, and we're really confident given the strength of demand from our customers, the success of our business model transition and our sales model transition, and just the portfolio that we have that is broader and deeper than anything else available in the market. So yes, we're looking forward to talking in more detail about those things next week.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: See u then. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blair Abernethy with Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nBlair Abernethy: Thank you. And nice quarter, guys. Just Ajei, just following on Jay's questioning. In terms of standardization, on the ANSYS platform, you mentioned in the WEG win that they've decided to standardize on ANSYS. And this is something that's been around for a few years. Is this a trend that you're starting to see pick up steam at all? And are you positioning or are you trying to help customers get more towards standardizing their simulation needs on your product set?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we have a broad platform and capability that allows us to be able to address the needs of our customers. And it's really the breadth and the depth of the portfolio that gives us the credibility to have those conversations with customers. And frankly, we believe we are differentiated in the marketplace because of the breadth and the depth of our portfolio. So if you talk to customers, they'll tell you they value the accuracy of what we do, they'll tell you they value the completeness of our solutions and our offerings. They'll tell you how we continue to innovate and invest in our portfolio. And they know that when they are making an investment in ANSYS, they're not just buying the product that we have today, they know that we're continuing to make investments, and we will continue to enhance the portfolio, and we'll make things better. And we'll deal with the challenges that they're likely to face in the future as well. So I think that gives us a tailwind when we go into some of these broader conversations. It is a difficult market to do wholesale replacements for one code base to another. If a customer is using a particular simulation for a number of years, they may continue to use that same simulation code for some period of time. So it does take some planning to do whole-scale replacements. But we're seeing more of that, and we're seeing competitive wins where we're replacing customers within customers, where we are replacing competitors who have been present for some number of years, and the customers made the decision to come to ANSYS, which we feel is a better choice. And obviously, the customer has also felt it's a better choice. So we're seeing that take place as well. So the dynamic is -- is, I think, driven by the strength of the product portfolio and the investments that we're making.\nBlair Abernethy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So you clearly delivered really strong double-digit ACV growth this quarter on a pretty difficult comp. You talked about not really seeing any demand impacts from your customers and the recurring piece of ACV is growing double digits as well. I guess I'm curious if you feel like the business has kind of hit an inflection point where that double-digit growth is sustainable? And I'm just curious if you think that's something related to the go-to market or the product strategy. If you could just comment on -- if you think that the business has kind of hit an inflection here.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So why don't I start. And then, Ajei, why don't you add any context to that? So thanks, Tyler, for your question. Yes, I mean I think what I would say is that the consistency of the performance throughout the year in the first half and the outlook for the second half is again on our model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. And we've been able to pretty consistently deliver that. I mean if you go back over the past couple of years and you look at heading into the end of 2022, our guide of $2 billion of ACV at the midpoint is consistent with guidance we gave in 2019 before there was a global pandemic, before there were significant shifts in the trade environment, and the underlying macro environment that we have today, which has had a significant impact on foreign exchange rates. And so I think that if you look back at the investments that we've made in the business to transition to a highly recurring subscription lease model, transition our go-to-market to build deeper customer relationships and build alongside their long-term road maps. And then the organic and the inorganic investments in our portfolio have all been really important factors in setting us up to be able to consistently deliver that model. And so we're really pleased with the performance of the business this year and the outlook that we're able to give for the rest of the year, and look forward to updating you guys a little bit more on what's to come. I don't know, Ajei, if there's anything you'd like to add to that?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. I think you'll hear some more next week at our investor update. But certainly, as Nicole was saying, this is -- we've been making investments over the last several years. And as I mentioned just earlier in this call, the strength of the product portfolio, I think, is really added to our ability to support our customers, and that obviously helps tremendously in the market. That's number one. And as you pointed out, the go-to-market has also been really important. We've gone through a process of transforming over the last several years of go to market. And we have great customer relationships. We continue to maintain those great customer relationships we have momentum. And our customers know that we support them and they know they can rely on us. And so when you start to put all of that together, it creates an environment where the value of simulation shines through, and our customers recognize that they can take advantage of ANSYS in order to achieve their own business objectives.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. And as my follow-up, I just wanted to clarify the performance. It looked like EMEA and APAC, in particular, were really strong, growing 30% or better. U.S. was actually down year-over-year. Could you just talk about what drove that large variance in geographic performance? And just anything to call out how we're thinking about international growth assumptions for the full year versus the U.S. Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So let me start with the broader point on kind of just some statement about quarterly revenue dynamics in general, right? So ASC 606 introduces a lot of volatility. And when you have mix differences in license compare on a year-over-year basis within a quarter, sometimes you get a lot of volatility. You get much more of it down at the geographic level. And so there's often not always consistency between the overall ACV growth in a region or in a market versus revenue growth. And that's why we kind of focused on longer-term revenue metrics and longer-term ACV metrics. But to answer your question specifically, let me start with Asia Pacific and EMEA. I mean, both had -- well, let me just start with -- as we stated in our prepared remarks, all markets -- we saw growth in all markets from an ACV standpoint, which is kind of that key metric of momentum. And from a revenue standpoint, as you point out, APAC and EMEA really did have great performance. I'd say there's a couple of dynamics going on there. In EMEA, we saw some pretty broad-based performance across all of our key industries in the high tech. We had a multiyear 8-figure sale to a European telecommunications company in aerospace and defense. We had several 7-figure contracts with customers and even in industrial equipment. Also saw strong Q2 where we signed an 8-figure deal with the German industrial machine manufacturer. So we saw strength in Europe across multiple industries. And in APAC, I mean APAC, again, is another quarter of consistently delivering growth in Asia Pacific. And it was -- the growth was particularly strong in our geography and momentum accounts. And in terms of large deals, we also saw it across multiple industries, high-tech auto. And it was really broad-based. And so to put this one into context, the management team in APAC really has been investing in deeper customer relationships and stuck with those customers through the pandemic. So that transformation of the go-to-market model and kind of aligning to the strategic road maps of your customers, and really being there for them in their time of need is really paying off in the consistent growth that we're seeing from the Asia Pacific region. Now to your question on Americas, again, as I will emphasize all regions grew, all regions grew ABB. Americas over the last 12 months has really been leading the company and delivering value for our customers. And we're expecting the region to be a strong performer in 2022 and beyond. In the second quarter, revenue did decline, but it was really expected. There was -- the growth year-to-year was impacted by a compare of Q2 '21, which had several large high-tech and automotive perpetual and multiyear lease sales. So again, the revenue dynamic in Americas was really a function of the 606 accounting and the comparability. Overall, we've just seen very consistent growth and performance across all geos.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for the detail. Look forward to the Analyst Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. We have the opportunity to attend a demo of the ANSYS Twin Builder a few months back. Just curious, how is that product growing relative to your internal plans? And what is the kind of feedback you're getting from the market?\nAjei Gopal: So obviously, we don't provide financial breakdowns on a per product basis. But let me give you some perspective on where we are with Twin Builder and the broader concept of digital twins. So the whole idea here is that with the digital twin, you're trying to create a digital equivalent of a product. And this is something that can transition from the design phase where typically our customers build 3D models, into the operation phase, where the digital twin, which is a simplified model of that full-fledged 3D model that's used for design, where that digital twin can be used for things like predictive maintenance, can be used for determining equipment uptime, replacement schedules and things of that nature. So we've seen certainly a lot of customer interest in that space. It's still early days. What we're demonstrating to customers is that physics-based digital twins, which is essentially what we do, coupled with some understanding of statistical techniques, when you put that together, which we encapsulate into our offerings, that provides them with tremendous accuracy with respect to some of the predictive maintenance capabilities that I just mentioned. So we continue to see interest in -- with customers. We continue to see momentum in that space. It's still relatively early days. It's still a relatively small market. Many customers are excited about the fact that we can do digital twins. They will lead with that conversation. And then they'll transition to other parts of the portfolio as well. So it's a great piece of the portfolio, and we're excited about the long-term future for this product area.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Sounds good. And just maybe a quick one for Nicole. On the recent tuck-in acquisitions, did they have much benefit to ACV or revenue in 2022?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. The tuck-in acquisitions, I think we may have talked about that in the last call. They're very small tuck-ins. The on-scale acquisitions, a technology play, it was -- we're really excited about it. It's a really complementary aspect to organic development in the space of native cloud. And so -- but that's a pretty immaterial contribution. And the Motor-CAD acquisition was actually a product that we OEM-ed. And so the net increment on the top line to that was immaterial as well. Just as a reminder, Zemax, we did give a guidance on Zemax, which is about $20 million of inorganic impact this year. And so that would be -- we see it consistent to how we've seen in prior quarters in terms of what the inorganic impact of Zemax would be. So does that answered the question.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSaket Kalia: Okay, great. Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. Ajei, maybe for you. I mean, since we're talking about M&A, I was wondering if you can just talk about the forward opportunity for tuck-in M&A. How do you feel about just the number of opportunities out there. And of course, as valuations hopefully adjust and with ANSYS' strong balance sheet, can you just talk about that part of the strategy and kind of how that plays into the total growth algorithm?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. So as I -- as we've always said, we think about -- when we think about the future of our industry and where we need to go, we think about the combination of organic development, partnerships and acquisitions. So it's the -- it's always build, partner, buy. And that's -- those are the considerations that we bring into the equation as we think about the future of our portfolio. And in that context, we are always looking out to see if there are M&A opportunities that are consistent with our strategy. Where we believe that we're disciplined investors, we're careful when we go into an M&A situation. We look carefully to make sure that there is the strategic value that we need. And that's how we think about the overall opportunity. And with valuations, valuations obviously have come down, and maybe that is a buying opportunity. But with quality, quality always is expensive. And so we want to make sure that we have the right technology and capability of products that we're in a position -- or companies that we're in a position to buy. Look, we're the -- you should know that we see most of the deals that are in our space, I mean -- because obviously, they get presented to us. And we are always -- when we look to that analysis, we look to make sure that we have great technology that we're bringing in. And if the technology is too far from the core, if we don't see a connection to our existing portfolio or go-to market, we pass. We've got a very rigorous process for diligence. We evaluate the core technology. We evaluate the stickiness of customer relationships. And when the technology isn't strong enough or customer relationships are superficial or we don't see strategic connections, we pass. So we're disciplined about this. But certainly, we will continue to evaluate M&A as and when it's appropriate in order to advance our strategy.\nSaket Kalia: Got it, got it. That makes a lot of sense. Nicole, maybe for my follow-up for you. Just to the earlier points on the multiyear license model, which we've seen, obviously, a very successful transition over many years. Now that we've had sort of several years of this model with good data on renewals, I'm wondering if you've looked at sort of a net revenue retention or net retention sort of rate on those renewals? And if you can talk to that, even qualitatively.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So I can give you -- why don't I kind of give you two lenses to that. So we -- why don't we start with just kind of the overall qualitative description of what drives the kind of overall high retention rates we have. And again, when we talk about retention rates around 90%, we're talking about the renewal of the original content, not kind of the net renewal, which includes new growth on top of that, right? So it would just be the renewal of that. . And so maybe just start a little bit with kind of the kind of strategic relationship strategy around multiyear leases. So as we engage with our customers, we engage with them on what is the outlook for the product road map going forward, whether it's the mix of physics that may be required and solutions to be able to kind of work against that road map. And we signed those multiyear lease agreements with them, kind of aligned to that overall road map. Now as you know, the world changes. And it doesn't -- just because it may be a two or three-year renewal ahead doesn't mean that customers' needs don't change, they don't grow. They buy companies. The competitive dynamics change. And so we are in a constantly ongoing relationship with those clients on a year-after-year basis in kind of preparing for that renewal that comes up. And so when we think about it from kind of that renewal of the renewal base coming up at the end of the three-year license, we have already had multiple years of conversations with those customers about the road map. And we have a lot of clarity around not only kind of what is the content that they'll continue to renew, but what are the new growth areas on top of that, that will extend them into the next chapter of their multiyear agreement. And so the relationships we have -- and this was part of the strategic selling transition model that we made over time. It was initially with a small subset of enterprise customers that, over the past five years, the go-to-market teams have really translated those best practices through the broader segmentations of our customer base and even into supporting the channel and having those conversations as well. And so that is the mode of strategic selling that really it does support those -- not only those very high retention rates that we talk about went up, but also the ability to continue to grow on top of that.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful, thanks.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question and fitting me in. Maybe just for Ajei, on the cloud. I haven't heard too much about that today, and I'm sure we'll talk a lot about it more next week. But just any updates on your various cloud ambition, including the recent on-scale acquisition that was just referenced. Thanks so much.\nAjei Gopal: So yes, I think you'll hear more about this next week. But very quickly -- in a previous call, I talked about how the engineering simulation software, a market that we participated in, is quite different from traditional enterprise applications. And we talked about the importance of high-performance computing to our users. And obviously, remember that a single engineer could run an ANSYS simulation that runs across hundreds of compute nodes for multiple hours. And so what we have got as part of our cloud strategy is a very -- I think, a very thoughtful approach that addresses the needs of our customers. And it's to really enable our customers, both existing and new, to be able to benefit from the insights of physics-based simulation and optimization, as well as to be able to scale out -- or to support the scale-out capabilities in the cloud. We've got two distinct classes of offerings, Cloud Marketplace and Cloud Native. We've talked at length, I think, in past calls, about some of the Cloud Marketplace offerings in -- I think, in the previous quarter and the one before that. So I'll skip that in the interest of time. But with respect to Cloud Native, that's when we're targeting new users and new use cases. And we're creating a cloud-based platform for the development and the deployment of new workflows. And our recent acquisition, as you said, of OnScale, which is the leader in cloud-based simulation, that's accelerating our ability to be able to do that. And they bring -- they brought a host of critical capabilities that will allow us to develop a new set of services. And frankly, the integration of what OnScale is doing in ANSYS is a powerful combination. So one example is OnScale's cloud-native user interface connected to our industry-leading simulation solvers in the back end. So we're excited about cloud. It's -- we have, I think, a very thoughtful and robust strategy. It's still early days. We do offer customers a variety of capabilities as they need it, when they need it. We believe that our capabilities are flexible and scalable. And frankly, we believe that we will be able to unlock a level of innovation across every industry around the world.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Thank you. And that's all the time we have today. I will turn it over to Ajei for his closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: I am more excited than ever by our excellent execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our robust pipeline, and I remain confident in our ability to achieve our ambitious goals. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS for their commitment, their focus and their many successes. And with that, I want to thank you for attending today's call, and I look forward to giving you more details on our long-term business and financial goals at next week's investor update, thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Q2 was yet another excellent quarter for ANSYS, where we once again beat across our key metrics including revenue, ACV, operating margin and earnings per share. That, coupled with our healthy pipeline, gives us further confidence in the business and has enabled us to raise our full year guidance on ACV and revenue in constant currency. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. Our largest contract of the quarter was a three-year, nearly $25 million agreement with an international electronics brand. This new contract includes ANSYS solutions for semiconductors, electronics, fluids, as well as our Learning Hub to make users more familiar and productive with our software. By standardizing on ANSYS solutions, this customer expects to increase its products yield while decreasing verification time for signal and power integrity. Another multimillion-dollar agreement in Q2 enables an international automotive OEM to expand its usage to include ANSYS solutions for enterprise-level materials intelligence, electromagnetic interference and autonomous driving. This customer has already realized up to 5x improvements in aerodynamics and thermal engineering productivity, a reduction of more than 40% in material properties acquisition costs and a 10% improvement in hydrogen storage for its fuel cells. From a geographical perspective, we saw strong revenue growth from Asia Pacific and EMEA and the Americas came in as expected. Our 36% constant currency growth in revenue in Asia Pacific was thanks to several large contracts, including one with Murata Manufacturing, a Japanese company that specializes in electronic components. With Murata, the multiyear agreement spans our multiphysics portfolio and provides the company with an important thermal aware system simulation flow for radio frequency modules. This solution is expected to provide faster thermal sign-off by reducing the number of redesigns and by improving the ease of use of ANSYS products through a single interface. From an industry perspective, the high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our largest contributors. We also saw continued strength in the energy space, reflecting a mix of traditional and renewable use cases as well as in the industrial equipment sector, where we recorded a number of multiyear agreements from companies around the world. For example, longtime customer WEG, a global leader in electrical engineering, power and automation technology signed a multiyear contract in Q2 to standardize on ANSYS simulation. This new agreement will help the Brazilian company rethink its product development process by creating and implementing digital twins of its motors. This agreement will drive WEG's electrification and green energy initiatives. Now I'd like to briefly mention a different kind of customer success story. I would like to congratulate NASA and Northrop Grumman on the success of the James Webb Space Telescope. We have all seen the stunning images that have come from this largest and most precise optical instrument ever developed, and we are proud here at ANSYS for the role that we played in its creation. Naturally, it was impossible to physically test the entire mission before launch. And given the unforgiving environment of space, the mission had to run as expected the first time. Any era would have cost billions of dollars in expenses with perhaps an even greater scientific loss. That is why the team developed the rocket, the telescope and the entire mission in part using ANSYS simulation. With ANSYS, engineers overcame a number of unique challenges, including folding a structure of the size of a tennis court into a rocket, and then unfolding it. And then understanding how perpetual solar radiation would affect its operations. Engineers use ANSYS mechanical to identify solutions to ensure the satellites' connected segment and mirror would behave the same way of monolithic mirror would. Our optical solutions were used to design and test each step in the mirror alignment process from the initial segment search to the final phasing. In addition, Mission Planer has used our digital mission engineering solutions to test variables that impact how the satellite is launched and to determine how to keep the satellite stationary 1 million miles from Earth. And the results, well they're simply out of this world. Turning to our leadership in solutions to multiphysics simulation. Our customers now have access to ANSYS 2022 Release 2, a comprehensive set of solutions and capabilities that cross physics, engineering disciplines and industries. Included in this release are machine learning techniques in our core products, which are automatically optimizing repetitive processes, predicting workflows and enhancing user productivity. We have also delivered artificial intelligence technology that enables customers to perform massive design optimization studies to arrive at an optimal design in a fraction of the time once required. This release also provides new high-performance computing capabilities and custom workflows for industry-specific applications, which will help more users address computationally complex problems by examining the impact of multiple physics at the same time. This added functionality is extending our multiphysics leadership, while enabling customers to make their next-generation products a reality. I am also excited that TSMC recently certified ANSYS' Power Integrity software for its industry-leading N4P and N3E process technologies. The certification for ANSYS RedHawk SC and ANSYS Totem enables next-generation silicon designs for machine learning, connectivity and high-performance computing applications. I'm also pleased to announce that ANSYS has joined the Intel Foundry Services Cloud Alliance. Our electronics and semiconductor suite, which includes ANSYS RedHawk SC, ANSYS HFSS and ANSYS RaptorX, are available as part of the design flow that will help enable Intel customers to enhance their productivity. Rounding out our partner updates, Samsung Foundry has announced that it is using ANSYS' industry-leading multiphysics solutions to develop designs on the most advanced chips, nodes and process technologies. Using ANSYS, Samsung Foundry will deliver a comprehensive design flow with greater capacity, speed and integration capabilities for the company's most advanced semiconductor technology to boost high-speed connectivity while helping to reduce design error and risk. On our last call, I discussed the role that ANSYS solutions are playing in our customers' sustainability initiatives, including for increasing fuel efficiency, in driving electrification and in decreasing the rate of emissions. We have recently created a cross-functional Center of Excellence composed of members of our development and consulting teams to advance sustainability initiatives for our customers and partners. Our subject matter experts are focused on how ANSYS simulation can help accelerate the creation of new, more efficient and lower-impact products beginning at the design and development phase. As part of our own sustainability endeavors, ANSYS is committed to reducing our environmental footprint. To that end, we have announced that we have set a 15% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2027. To hit that target, we are implementing projects identified in energy audits, including lighting enhancements and on-site renewable energy. We recently submitted to the Carbon Disclosure Project for the third year in a row, and continue to enhance our task force on climate-related financial disclosures. I am also excited to announce that Fast Company has recognized several ANSYS employees with its world-changing Ideas Award for the ANSYS Minerva template. This template is built in our Minerva solution for simulation process and data management, and provides an FDA guided approval process for medical devices to speed potentially life-saving products to patients more quickly. I'm also proud that ANSYS has been certified as the Most Loved Workplace by the Best Practice Institute. This honor was bestowed on ANSYS because of our collaboration, our corporate values and practices as well as the outcomes we drive and demonstrates why we are an employer of choice. Next week, we'll have an opportunity to discuss ANSYS' longer-term business and financial goals as part of our investor update. I'm looking forward to further explaining the expansive role that simulation is playing in product development and sharing with you how ANSYS has become a trusted business partner with some of the top brands around the world. To summarize, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS, resulting in us beating our guidance across all key metrics. Our business momentum, our expanded product leadership and the ongoing strength of our customer pipeline gives me even more confidence in our ability to meet our outlook for 2022. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Just to amplify the point that Nicole was making, I mean, many of our customers they're certainly aware of these broader geopolitical concerns and pressures that we all see, but they continue to face competitive pressures. And they've got multiyear product road maps that they've been driving. And frankly, that's where simulation comes in. Simulation helps them to deal with some of the competitive pressures that they're dealing with. It allows them to innovate more rapidly. And at the same time, it allows them to save money and time because we can reduce reliance on physical testing, we can reduce warranty costs and so forth. And so the value proposition for simulation, which is it helps our customers both drive top line growth as well as achieve bottom line savings, that value proposition is really a compelling value proposition, and that's, I think, what we're seeing in the market. No. I think -- as I said in the comments, our performance was pretty consistent across the verticals as we expected to see. Certainly, the bigger verticals are high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, automotive and ground transportation, but we saw strength in other areas as well. So nothing specifically to note in terms of explicit areas of consideration or concern. And operationally, when you think about it, I mean the sales team manages relationships with the customers. And obviously, as Nicole said, there's a lot of timing around that in terms of when projects are kicked off in activity. So that drives the timing of some of the larger deals as well. So Jay, as you know, I mean, we've been on this journey towards multiphysics sales quite for some time now, and we continue to execute along that direction as you pointed out. And certainly, our pipeline, especially as you consider the larger enterprise customers, our pipeline very much includes solutions that comprise of products from multiple parts of our portfolio. And so the multiphysics message is strong. It addresses what customers are looking for. We have been a pioneer in that space, and we continue to see benefit from that, and we certainly see traction from customers as we continue to support them. So absolutely, as we look ahead, we have multiphysics activity and multiple product sales into our customer base, certainly at the larger end, but it's also increasingly -- as you start to look down the pyramid, we see multiphysics capabilities penetrating into the customer base. So I think that's very important. You mentioned a couple of product lines. Obviously, we don't give quantitative breakouts by products, but I can give you some qualitative color. You asked about Minerva. I gave you, I think in the script, I mentioned some of the workflows that we've put in place in the health care area. Minerva continues to be an important aspect managing simulation data given the amount of simulation information that's being created by our customers, managing that simulation data effectively is important, and that's -- Minerva plays a role in that. Materials, I've also mentioned -- and I think I mentioned in a couple of places, certainly in the past couple of calls, materials is also important, and we certainly recognize customers as they start to go through design optimization opportunities the choice of materials is really important. Materials plays another interesting role in sustainability as well because when you consider the long-term compliance with regulations about materials that could be used, understanding the materials within our product design, something which could potentially take a number of years from design into actual implementation, really understanding what's in the product that's being built to make sure that you're compliant with the most recent regulations, that's also important. And so that's another area where materials comes in. Model basis and engineering, we continue to make progress in that area. It's really across the board where we have been able to have -- build on the strength of our ANSYS, traditional ANSYS products. We've supplemented that with acquisitions as and when appropriate, as it makes sense given our strategy. And we've continued to build the portfolio out to something that I'm very excited about and I know our customers are very excited about. Well, I think it's a reflection of the fact that we have a broad platform and capability that allows us to be able to address the needs of our customers. And it's really the breadth and the depth of the portfolio that gives us the credibility to have those conversations with customers. And frankly, we believe we are differentiated in the marketplace because of the breadth and the depth of our portfolio. So if you talk to customers, they'll tell you they value the accuracy of what we do, they'll tell you they value the completeness of our solutions and our offerings. They'll tell you how we continue to innovate and invest in our portfolio. And they know that when they are making an investment in ANSYS, they're not just buying the product that we have today, they know that we're continuing to make investments, and we will continue to enhance the portfolio, and we'll make things better. And we'll deal with the challenges that they're likely to face in the future as well. So I think that gives us a tailwind when we go into some of these broader conversations. It is a difficult market to do wholesale replacements for one code base to another. If a customer is using a particular simulation for a number of years, they may continue to use that same simulation code for some period of time. So it does take some planning to do whole-scale replacements. But we're seeing more of that, and we're seeing competitive wins where we're replacing customers within customers, where we are replacing competitors who have been present for some number of years, and the customers made the decision to come to ANSYS, which we feel is a better choice. And obviously, the customer has also felt it's a better choice. So we're seeing that take place as well. So the dynamic is -- is, I think, driven by the strength of the product portfolio and the investments that we're making. Yes. I think you'll hear some more next week at our investor update. But certainly, as Nicole was saying, this is -- we've been making investments over the last several years. And as I mentioned just earlier in this call, the strength of the product portfolio, I think, is really added to our ability to support our customers, and that obviously helps tremendously in the market. That's number one. And as you pointed out, the go-to-market has also been really important. We've gone through a process of transforming over the last several years of go to market. And we have great customer relationships. We continue to maintain those great customer relationships we have momentum. And our customers know that we support them and they know they can rely on us. And so when you start to put all of that together, it creates an environment where the value of simulation shines through, and our customers recognize that they can take advantage of ANSYS in order to achieve their own business objectives. So obviously, we don't provide financial breakdowns on a per product basis. But let me give you some perspective on where we are with Twin Builder and the broader concept of digital twins. So the whole idea here is that with the digital twin, you're trying to create a digital equivalent of a product. And this is something that can transition from the design phase where typically our customers build 3D models, into the operation phase, where the digital twin, which is a simplified model of that full-fledged 3D model that's used for design, where that digital twin can be used for things like predictive maintenance, can be used for determining equipment uptime, replacement schedules and things of that nature. So we've seen certainly a lot of customer interest in that space. It's still early days. What we're demonstrating to customers is that physics-based digital twins, which is essentially what we do, coupled with some understanding of statistical techniques, when you put that together, which we encapsulate into our offerings, that provides them with tremendous accuracy with respect to some of the predictive maintenance capabilities that I just mentioned. So we continue to see interest in -- with customers. We continue to see momentum in that space. It's still relatively early days. It's still a relatively small market. Many customers are excited about the fact that we can do digital twins. They will lead with that conversation. And then they'll transition to other parts of the portfolio as well. So it's a great piece of the portfolio, and we're excited about the long-term future for this product area. Yes. So as I -- as we've always said, we think about -- when we think about the future of our industry and where we need to go, we think about the combination of organic development, partnerships and acquisitions. So it's the -- it's always build, partner, buy. And that's -- those are the considerations that we bring into the equation as we think about the future of our portfolio. And in that context, we are always looking out to see if there are M&A opportunities that are consistent with our strategy. Where we believe that we're disciplined investors, we're careful when we go into an M&A situation. We look carefully to make sure that there is the strategic value that we need. And that's how we think about the overall opportunity. And with valuations, valuations obviously have come down, and maybe that is a buying opportunity. But with quality, quality always is expensive. And so we want to make sure that we have the right technology and capability of products that we're in a position -- or companies that we're in a position to buy. Look, we're the -- you should know that we see most of the deals that are in our space, I mean -- because obviously, they get presented to us. And we are always -- when we look to that analysis, we look to make sure that we have great technology that we're bringing in. And if the technology is too far from the core, if we don't see a connection to our existing portfolio or go-to market, we pass. We've got a very rigorous process for diligence. We evaluate the core technology. We evaluate the stickiness of customer relationships. And when the technology isn't strong enough or customer relationships are superficial or we don't see strategic connections, we pass. So we're disciplined about this. But certainly, we will continue to evaluate M&A as and when it's appropriate in order to advance our strategy. So yes, I think you'll hear more about this next week. But very quickly -- in a previous call, I talked about how the engineering simulation software, a market that we participated in, is quite different from traditional enterprise applications. And we talked about the importance of high-performance computing to our users. And obviously, remember that a single engineer could run an ANSYS simulation that runs across hundreds of compute nodes for multiple hours. And so what we have got as part of our cloud strategy is a very -- I think, a very thoughtful approach that addresses the needs of our customers. And it's to really enable our customers, both existing and new, to be able to benefit from the insights of physics-based simulation and optimization, as well as to be able to scale out -- or to support the scale-out capabilities in the cloud. We've got two distinct classes of offerings, Cloud Marketplace and Cloud Native. We've talked at length, I think, in past calls, about some of the Cloud Marketplace offerings in -- I think, in the previous quarter and the one before that. So I'll skip that in the interest of time. But with respect to Cloud Native, that's when we're targeting new users and new use cases. And we're creating a cloud-based platform for the development and the deployment of new workflows. And our recent acquisition, as you said, of OnScale, which is the leader in cloud-based simulation, that's accelerating our ability to be able to do that. And they bring -- they brought a host of critical capabilities that will allow us to develop a new set of services. And frankly, the integration of what OnScale is doing in ANSYS is a powerful combination. So one example is OnScale's cloud-native user interface connected to our industry-leading simulation solvers in the back end. So we're excited about cloud. It's -- we have, I think, a very thoughtful and robust strategy. It's still early days. We do offer customers a variety of capabilities as they need it, when they need it. We believe that our capabilities are flexible and scalable. And frankly, we believe that we will be able to unlock a level of innovation across every industry around the world. I am more excited than ever by our excellent execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our robust pipeline, and I remain confident in our ability to achieve our ambitious goals. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS for their commitment, their focus and their many successes. And with that, I want to thank you for attending today's call, and I look forward to giving you more details on our long-term business and financial goals at next week's investor update, thank you."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and full year 2022. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and better than our guidance. Revenue, operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q2 guidance, driven by ACV outperformance and the mix of license types sold in the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Q2 ACV was $460.3 million and grew year-over-year 7% or 13% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across all geographic regions and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 14% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. ACV from recurring sources represented 81% of the total in the second quarter. Q2 total revenue was $475.9 million and grew 5% or 12% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance, driven by outperforming our expected ACV. Asia Pacific and EMEA drove strong Q2 revenue growth. We had robust top line performance in Q2, with ACV and revenue both growing double digit in constant currency at 13% and 12%, respectively. In both Q2 and the first half, we executed against our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of almost $1.2 billion, which grew 27% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 40.7%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue as well as the timing of investments that have moved into the second half of the year. The result was second quarter EPS of $1.77, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18%, the tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our cash flow from operations in the second quarter totaled $118.9 million, which benefited from continued strong collections. We ended the quarter with $517.6 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. The underlying momentum in our business and demand for our best-in-class portfolio continues to be strong. We are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. We delivered a robust Q2, and our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. However, offsetting our first half performance and strong full year outlook is continued and significant U.S. dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rates embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 1.6 points of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.98 billion to $2.020 billion. This represents growth of 5.8% to 8%, or 11.3% to 13.5% in constant currency and a midpoint of $2 billion, which puts us on track to achieve the 2019 Investor Day target. For additional context, the $2 billion midpoint of our ACV guidance when translated at 2019 foreign exchange rates would equal approximately $2.07 billion and would exceed our 2019 Investor Day ACV target. Our full year ACV raise is driven by the strong performance we saw in Q2 and improved forecast and momentum we see in the business, especially for Q3. That underlying improvement drove a full year ACV operational increase of $29 million relative to our May guidance. This operational momentum was offset by $19 million of foreign exchange headwind. Turning to revenue. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.005 billion to $2.055 billion, which is growth of 3.8% to 6.4% or 9.2% to 11.8% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by one point of constant currency growth compared to our May guidance. This raise is driven by the strong revenue performance we saw in Q2 and improved forecast we see for the rest of the year. That underlying improvement drove a full year revenue operational increase of $18 million relative to our May guidance. This operational momentum was offset by $23 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.50 to $7.88. Relative to our May guidance, our full year EPS increased $0.07 from better operational performance, which was offset by $0.12 of foreign exchange headwind. As a reminder, some of our strong Q2 EPS performance was driven by the timing of investments that moved from Q2 to the second half of the year. We continue to expect our full year operating margin to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Given the rapidly changing interest rate environment, we thought it would be helpful to provide full year interest expense for your modeling purposes. As a reminder, our term loan structure has floating interest rates and rising interest rates will continue to impact interest expense. Our current outlook projects our full year 2022 interest expense to be $22 million, up almost $10 million from last year. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $610 million. Relative to our May guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $6 million from better operational performance, which was offset by $6 million of foreign exchange headwind. Also note on a year-over-year basis operating cash flow continues to face nonoperational headwinds, including the timing impact of R&E capitalization regulations and higher interest expense, given rising interest rates. Since January 2022, we have seen significant U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and Japanese yen. The trajectory of the movement of these currencies has been outsized relative to typical currency fluctuation impacts. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $100 million and an operating cash flow by approximately $35 million. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business is operationally strong and has considerable momentum. Now let me turn to guidance for Q3. For the third quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $392 million to $412 million and revenue in the range of $455 million to $475 million. Our outlook implies double-digit ACV constant currency growth for Q3 and the full year 2022, in line with our business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We expect Q3 operating margin in the range of 37.8% to 39.4% and EPS in the range of $1.56 to $1.70. Further details around specific currency rates, interest expense and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q3 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast, diversified business model and high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum of our business. This is reflected in the increased outlook for constant currency ACV and revenue growth and the operational improvements in our cash flow outlook. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your outstanding execution in the quarter, which drove our robust Q2 financial performance and continued momentum going into the second half of the year. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with our recurring business model and growing sales forecast, demonstrated the strength of the ANSYS business. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook as well as our long-term strategy. I am more confident than ever in our future. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions. Sure. Thanks for your question, Ken. So yes, as we pointed out, as we pointed out in our guidance, we have -- we are seeing -- we're really seeing underlying strong momentum in the business. The beat to the Q2 numbers was really kind of evidence of continuing broad-based building pipeline. And as we -- now that we're in the second half of the year, we have a much clearer visibility to kind of what that second half pipeline looks like and kind of how it will land over the next couple of quarters. And while we're certainly very sensitized to the macro environment overall and what's occurring with the rest of the tech industry, our business is highly exposed to R&D. And as you recall, R&D is usually the last thing to go off and the first thing to come back on when they're tightening. And so we're just not seeing the same level of constraint that may be some other parts of the tech sector are seeing. And the outlook of our guidance really reflects the broad-based demand across industries, geographies and customer segments that we saw in Q2 and that we kind of see coming into the pipeline in the back half of the year. Joe, thanks for the question. So how I would characterize the second half guidance is just much clearer visibility to where deals land. As you know, we've transitioned to a multiyear lease subscription model over the past couple of years. And so as you move into that multiyear lease model, your kind of timing of when the renewal base happens both within the quarter and across the quarters and within the years, can start to shift over time. And so I would characterize the second half as the kind of clearest visibility we have from where we're sitting today, which is quite clear once you get into the second half because your sales cycles tend to be three to six months long. So you have a little bit more clarity in terms of what the timing of those things may line up to. So I would characterize it -- I think it's maybe a little bit slightly -- it's slightly stronger from a growth rate standpoint. I think the overall skew is pretty similar to prior quarters. It might be a little bit heavier weighted into Q3 than maybe last year. But I would characterize it as kind of a reflection of the timing of the yield of the pipeline we see today with a slightly stronger Q4 growth rate as a result of the year-to-year compare. Yes. No. I mean what -- the kind of -- the SMB customer base is reflected in kind of our geography and momentum. Momentum accounts primarily continue to be consistent in what they deliver. They're consistent with what we expected coming into the year. The second half pipeline is consistent with what we would have expected to see. And when you look again at the mix of Q3 versus Q4 ACV, I mean they're pretty close in terms of percentages. So in terms of the percentage of ACV that occurred last year versus this year, the growth rates again might be a little bit skewed. Thanks, Jay. Yes. So as you pointed out, we have our investor update scheduled for next week. We're really looking forward to sharing that long-term guidance with you next week. But what I -- so I can't comment about the future. But certainly, it's not too long before we can comment on the future. So stay tuned. But yes, I mean what we have stated and what we continue to be confident in is a business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. I think if you look at the course of this year, we have consistently delivered it in the second quarter in the half -- in our outlook for the second half of the year. We're squarely on that model, and we're really confident given the strength of demand from our customers, the success of our business model transition and our sales model transition, and just the portfolio that we have that is broader and deeper than anything else available in the market. So yes, we're looking forward to talking in more detail about those things next week. Yes. So why don't I start. And then, Ajei, why don't you add any context to that? So thanks, Tyler, for your question. Yes, I mean I think what I would say is that the consistency of the performance throughout the year in the first half and the outlook for the second half is again on our model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. And we've been able to pretty consistently deliver that. I mean if you go back over the past couple of years and you look at heading into the end of 2022, our guide of $2 billion of ACV at the midpoint is consistent with guidance we gave in 2019 before there was a global pandemic, before there were significant shifts in the trade environment, and the underlying macro environment that we have today, which has had a significant impact on foreign exchange rates. And so I think that if you look back at the investments that we've made in the business to transition to a highly recurring subscription lease model, transition our go-to-market to build deeper customer relationships and build alongside their long-term road maps. And then the organic and the inorganic investments in our portfolio have all been really important factors in setting us up to be able to consistently deliver that model. And so we're really pleased with the performance of the business this year and the outlook that we're able to give for the rest of the year, and look forward to updating you guys a little bit more on what's to come. I don't know, Ajei, if there's anything you'd like to add to that? Sure. So let me start with the broader point on kind of just some statement about quarterly revenue dynamics in general, right? So ASC 606 introduces a lot of volatility. And when you have mix differences in license compare on a year-over-year basis within a quarter, sometimes you get a lot of volatility. You get much more of it down at the geographic level. And so there's often not always consistency between the overall ACV growth in a region or in a market versus revenue growth. And that's why we kind of focused on longer-term revenue metrics and longer-term ACV metrics. But to answer your question specifically, let me start with Asia Pacific and EMEA. I mean, both had -- well, let me just start with -- as we stated in our prepared remarks, all markets -- we saw growth in all markets from an ACV standpoint, which is kind of that key metric of momentum. And from a revenue standpoint, as you point out, APAC and EMEA really did have great performance. I'd say there's a couple of dynamics going on there. In EMEA, we saw some pretty broad-based performance across all of our key industries in the high tech. We had a multiyear 8-figure sale to a European telecommunications company in aerospace and defense. We had several 7-figure contracts with customers and even in industrial equipment. Also saw strong Q2 where we signed an 8-figure deal with the German industrial machine manufacturer. So we saw strength in Europe across multiple industries. And in APAC, I mean APAC, again, is another quarter of consistently delivering growth in Asia Pacific. And it was -- the growth was particularly strong in our geography and momentum accounts. And in terms of large deals, we also saw it across multiple industries, high-tech auto. And it was really broad-based. And so to put this one into context, the management team in APAC really has been investing in deeper customer relationships and stuck with those customers through the pandemic. So that transformation of the go-to-market model and kind of aligning to the strategic road maps of your customers, and really being there for them in their time of need is really paying off in the consistent growth that we're seeing from the Asia Pacific region. Now to your question on Americas, again, as I will emphasize all regions grew, all regions grew ABB. Americas over the last 12 months has really been leading the company and delivering value for our customers. And we're expecting the region to be a strong performer in 2022 and beyond. In the second quarter, revenue did decline, but it was really expected. There was -- the growth year-to-year was impacted by a compare of Q2 '21, which had several large high-tech and automotive perpetual and multiyear lease sales. So again, the revenue dynamic in Americas was really a function of the 606 accounting and the comparability. Overall, we've just seen very consistent growth and performance across all geos. Yes. The tuck-in acquisitions, I think we may have talked about that in the last call. They're very small tuck-ins. The on-scale acquisitions, a technology play, it was -- we're really excited about it. It's a really complementary aspect to organic development in the space of native cloud. And so -- but that's a pretty immaterial contribution. And the Motor-CAD acquisition was actually a product that we OEM-ed. And so the net increment on the top line to that was immaterial as well. Just as a reminder, Zemax, we did give a guidance on Zemax, which is about $20 million of inorganic impact this year. And so that would be -- we see it consistent to how we've seen in prior quarters in terms of what the inorganic impact of Zemax would be. So does that answered the question. Yes. So I can give you -- why don't I kind of give you two lenses to that. So we -- why don't we start with just kind of the overall qualitative description of what drives the kind of overall high retention rates we have. And again, when we talk about retention rates around 90%, we're talking about the renewal of the original content, not kind of the net renewal, which includes new growth on top of that, right? So it would just be the renewal of that. . And so maybe just start a little bit with kind of the kind of strategic relationship strategy around multiyear leases. So as we engage with our customers, we engage with them on what is the outlook for the product road map going forward, whether it's the mix of physics that may be required and solutions to be able to kind of work against that road map. And we signed those multiyear lease agreements with them, kind of aligned to that overall road map. Now as you know, the world changes. And it doesn't -- just because it may be a two or three-year renewal ahead doesn't mean that customers' needs don't change, they don't grow. They buy companies. The competitive dynamics change. And so we are in a constantly ongoing relationship with those clients on a year-after-year basis in kind of preparing for that renewal that comes up. And so when we think about it from kind of that renewal of the renewal base coming up at the end of the three-year license, we have already had multiple years of conversations with those customers about the road map. And we have a lot of clarity around not only kind of what is the content that they'll continue to renew, but what are the new growth areas on top of that, that will extend them into the next chapter of their multiyear agreement. And so the relationships we have -- and this was part of the strategic selling transition model that we made over time. It was initially with a small subset of enterprise customers that, over the past five years, the go-to-market teams have really translated those best practices through the broader segmentations of our customer base and even into supporting the channel and having those conversations as well. And so that is the mode of strategic selling that really it does support those -- not only those very high retention rates that we talk about went up, but also the ability to continue to grow on top of that."

During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm happy to report that Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS. We again beat across all our key metrics and grew ACV by nearly 11% in constant currency. We believe that this continued momentum, combined with our strong customer relationships and leading multiphysics product suite, will set the tone for Q2 and the rest of the year. These strong results came in the midst of continued disruptions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred additional lockdowns in certain regions as well as geopolitical dynamics. As we have previously announced, we have suspended all new and ongoing business with Russia and Belarus and removed them from our 2022 forecast. ANSYS has contributed to the Ukrainian relief efforts, and our hearts go out to all those affected by these tragic events. We are not only absorbing the headwinds from sanctions, but based on the strength of the forecast and the ongoing demand for our multiphysics solutions, we are increasing our operational outlook on ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes, including a discussion of the impact of global currency exchange rates on our outlook. Focusing now on Q1. From a revenue perspective, we saw good growth, as expected, across all our geographies, led by the Americas and Asia Pacific. The demand for ANSYS simulation has been relatively consistent across industries for the last several years. Given recent events and market conditions, we are now seeing an increased activity in energy and sustainability initiatives, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and in aerospace and defense accounts. Our largest contract for the quarter was a three year $44 million agreement with a North American defense contractor. This long-time customer is using our broad solution set to power its digital transformation through integrated digital engineering, multidisciplinary design optimization and digital mission engineering. The customer is realizing a strong return on its investment in ANSYS by helping it to win new government contracts while driving cost out of its organization. On these calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several calls, I have discussed the unparalleled scalability of our best-in-class fluid products. I highlighted the critical role that ANSYS solutions are playing in the development of next-generation semiconductors, and I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. For this call, I would like to discuss the critical role that ANSYS plays in sustainability. Sustainability is a crucial and complex topic that crosses industries and one that plays to ANSYS' strengths in multiphysics simulation. ANSYS simulation has traditionally enabled companies to save resources and energy before physical products are ever built, thanks to virtual prototyping. Today, though, through the use of our broad multiphysics portfolio, we can enable a number of our customers' sustainability initiatives, too many, in fact, to mention on this call. Let me give you just three representative examples so you have a sense as to the role that simulation is playing in sustainability: first, in increasing fuel efficiency; next, in driving electrification; and finally, in decreasing the rates of emissions. Let me start with fuel and energy efficiency, where a variety of ANSYS multiphysics products are being used to solve challenges ranging from engine effectiveness to electric battery design. The outcomes from these initiatives are reducing dependence on pollution producing fossil fuels. We announced earlier this week that we are working with Safran Aircraft Engines to support its aviation sustainability efforts while advancing productivity and cost efficiency. Using ANSYS' structural and thermal solutions for an advanced open fan architecture, new materials and hybrid electrification capabilities, the company expects to reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by more than 20% when compared to today's most efficient engines. Similarly, in Q4, we announced a new five year enterprise license agreement with LG Electronics to support the company's sustainability initiatives. ANSYS' multiphysics solutions are enabling more resource-efficient production that makes product development more sustainable by significantly reducing material use, costs and multiple redesigns. For example, ANSYS' virtual model offers one to three decoupling to support the development of the compressors used in LG's home appliances. As a result, LG Electronics can introduce its next-generation products faster than ever while accelerating its digital transformation and decreasing its carbon footprint. Turning to electrification. Customers are employing ANSYS solutions to improve the efficiency of electric motors, which today consume over 45% of the world's electricity. For example, in Q1, we signed a multiyear contract with Turntide Technologies, which develops solutions that accelerate electrification and sustainable operations for energy-intensive industries. Turntide is a long-time ANSYS user and this new contract broadens the company's use of multiphysics simulation to optimize product and engineering efficiency while reducing the need for physical prototyping as well as cutting development time and costs. On past calls, I've discussed the use of ANSYS solutions in the development of electric cars. In Q1, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team won the top two spots at the Mexico City E-Prix, with the help of a customized powertrain developed with ANSYS technologies. Working with ANSYS, Porsche Motorsport engineers accelerated the virtual testing of design concepts to provide the best powertrain solution without using physical prototypes. The powertrain innovations used on the racetrack will spur development of energy efficient, affordable and sustainable commercial vehicles at Porsche. To compliment the ANSYS Electric machine design offering, we recently acquired Motor Design Limited by combining motor designs, Motor-CAD product with the rest of the ANSYS portfolio, we will offer customers the most comprehensive multiphysics workflow for electric machine design. This end-to-end solution will enable customers to not only design more efficient electric machines, but also apply them to more applications which will reduce the environmental impact as well as the cost. Motor Design is an established ANSYS OEM partner and is already integrated seamlessly into our go-to-market motion. Moving to emissions, ANSYS simulation is helping customers reduce their carbon footprint through the development of renewable energy sources, including wind and solar power. We recently announced that we are working with leading renewable energy company Vestas to deliver safer and more sustainable power management solutions for its wind turbine control systems. These controllers are responsible for optimizing power performance and preventing component damage across a range of wind conditions. Using our model-based software development environment, Vestas merge data from multiple sensors and created control algorithms to drive better turbine designs at lower costs. We also announced that we are working with ANSYS startup program member Synhelion to convert carbon dioxide and water into synthetic fuels including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Synhelion uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a solar receiver that drives the thermochemical reactor that produces these sustainable fuels. Using ANSYS, this innovative company can simulate the thermo-fluid dynamics needed to design and validate its equipment despite the intense conditions caused by the searing temperatures. As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of the examples of how ANSYS simulation is fueling the sustainability initiatives of some of the most innovative organizations on the planet. You will hear even more real world sustainability use cases during our upcoming simulation world event on May 18. During simulation world, you'll also learn about the launch of Earth Rescue, our online series that will showcase other ANSYS customers use of simulation in combating the climate crisis. I encourage you to attend and to learn more about these remarkable use cases of ANSYS Simulation. Moving to ANSYS\u2019 own sustainability initiatives, in Q1, we released our corporate responsibility report. In this annual update, we focused on our core pillars of advancing sustainability through our leading multiphysics products, by investing in our employees, by operating responsibly and through our collaboration with various stakeholders. As an example of our growing ecosystem stakeholders, the University of Colorado Boulder will give engineers hands on experience by incorporating ANSYS multiphysics solutions into its new masters program in high speed digital engineering. These students will join their peers in more than 3,300 universities in 90 countries who are developing industry-ready simulation skills. Thanks to ANSYS products. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS and one that will set the tone for the rest of 2022. Our continued momentum, our strong customer relationships and our best-in-class multiphysics product suite will help us drive even further success in 2022 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Nicole, I'm excited to announce that longtime ANSYS executive, Walt Hearn is now leading our global sales and customer excellence teams, replacing industry veteran Rick Mahoney. Walt has an unparalleled track record of success at ANSYS. And most recently has led our largest and fastest growing region in the Americas. He has personally overseen some of the largest contracts from our enterprise accounts and has led the modernization of our go-to-market motion. With his energy, industry knowledge, deep customer relationships and mastery of our complete product portfolio, Walt is the right executive to assume leadership of this next phase of our go-to-market journey. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2022. The first quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and revenue operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q1 guidance, driven by the mix of license types sold on the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $344.1 million and grew year-over-year 8% or 11% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across most geographic regions and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 16% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. Q1 total revenue with $428.6 million and grew 15% or 18% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by the timing of perpetual license deals that closed in the quarter. Q1 revenue growth was broad based across geographies. We had strong top line performance in Q1 with ACV and revenue, both growing double-digit and constant currency at 11% and 18% respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.2 billion, which grew 28% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter growth margin of 89.6% and an operating margin of 34.7%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue. The result with first quarter EPS of $1.36, which was also better than our guidance, similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18%. The tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our cash flow from operations in the first quarter totaled $210.9 million, which benefited from strong collections. We ended the quarter with $657.8 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares during the quarter for around $156 million. We have 2 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Although Russia and Belarus are not material in size to our overall business, we have fully absorbed the removal of Russia and Belarus from our outlook for the remainder of the year given the sanctions. The momentum of our business exceeds this impact. And as a result, we are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. The underlying momentum in our business is strong. We delivered a robust Q1 coming off a great Q4 2021. And our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. However, offsetting that strong outlook is significant U.S. dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rate embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We are updating our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.960 billion to $2.020 billion. This represents growth of 4.8% to 8% or 9.2% to 12.4% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. This raise is driven by the strong ACV performance we saw on Q1 and improved forecast we see for the rest of the year. That underlying improvement drove a full year ACV operational increase of $35 million relative to our February guidance. This operational momentum was offset by absorbing $18 million of Russia and Belarus business and $47 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion, which is growth of 3.8% to 6.9% or 8% to 11.1% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth. Relative to our February guidance, our full year revenue increased $20 million from operational performance, which was offset by absorbing $15 million from Russia and Belarus and $45 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.53 to $7.94. Relative to our February guidance, our full year EPS increased around $0.25 from better operational performance and lower share count, which was offset by absorbing $0.14 from Russia and Belarus and $0.24 of foreign exchange headwind. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $610 million, which as discussed with our February guidance includes the $60 million to $80 million of cash timing impact of R&E capitalization regulations that are in effect as of January 1, 2022. Relative to our February guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $20 million from better operational performance, which was offset by absorbing $12 million from Russia and Belarus collections and $18 million of foreign exchange headwind. Since January 2022, we have seen significant U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and Japanese yen. The trajectory of the movement of these currencies has been outsized relative to typical currency fluctuation impacts. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $80 million and on operating cash by approximately $30 million. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business is operationally strong and has considerable momentum. Now let me turn to guidance for Q2. For the second quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $442 million to $462 million and revenue in the range of $450 million to $475 million. Our outlook implies double digit ACV constant currency growth for both the first half and full year 2022 in line with our business model of double digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We expect Q2 operating margin in the range of 36% to 38.1% and EPS in the range of $1.46 to $1.64. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q2 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast, diversified business model and high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum in our business as reflected in the increased outlook for constant currency ACV and revenue growth and the operational improvements in our cash flow outlook. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for a strong Q1 financial performance and for all of the efforts from not only this past quarter, but for those of the last few years, as we continue to grow, invest in our business and execute against our strategic priorities. I appreciate the can do attitude, the push for excellence and the customer centric focus of the entire team. Our people and physics-based simulation solutions have earned us our industry leading world class reputation as the go-to source to solve the most difficult problems and to create what was previously impossible. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook and our strategic investments will propel us into the journey to enhance our value to customers, to our shareholders, and to make a world \u2013 the world a better place for years to come. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning, Ajei and Nicole. Ajei, let me start with you with a somewhat broad question about trends within the overall engineering software industry. Over the last number of years simulation has surpassed PLM to become the second largest category within engineering software. And it seems not that far behind the CAD market may even perhaps have already surpassed that. It\u2019s very close. And the question is, as we now are much more of a simulation centric world than let\u2019s say a CAD centric world that we\u2019ve had for the last 20 or more years. What are the implications for you in terms of the kinds of internal investments incrementally you would need to make, perhaps in services and support, perhaps altering your product release cadence and the three year that you have now? Anything of that kind given the altered status let\u2019s say of simulation within the overall engineering software market? And then a follow-up for you, Nicole. With regard to cash flow stripping out currency effects, I\u2019m just looking at operational trends within cash flow, how are you thinking about working capital leverage? Is there anything structural, let\u2019s say that is occurring or that you could make happen in terms of AR or deferred to just get more velocity out of your working capital?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, Jay, this is Ajei. Thanks for the question. So, as you rightly point out simulation is something that we\u2019ve always said is really critical for our customers. And obviously, we\u2019re seeing the greater use of simulation in the market as you\u2019ve alluded to. And the reason as you know is it comes directly from product design and the complexity that products are \u2013 customers are facing in their own products. You know, for \u2013 and as you know from your experience, simulation, when you\u2019re building a product, the more you can simulate, the more simulations you run, the better it is in terms of the product performance, the cost, the effectiveness of that product. Customers are recognizing that, and they\u2019re running more and more simulations. That\u2019s a tailwind for us. You also recognize as products become more complex, it\u2019s not just about individual physics excellence. And we certainly invest in individual physics excellence. It\u2019s also about the integration of the technologies together to be able to create a multi-physics solution and a multi-physics capability. And that\u2019s also been an area for investment for us. If you look at, for example, some of the recent investments we\u2019ve made on the platform, we\u2019ve talked a lot about clients, the APIs that we\u2019ve made available where people can write Python applications and directly invoke our simulation capabilities. And at the same time have access to the wide variety of the Python ecosystem. So those are some examples of where we\u2019re trying to make it much easier for our customers to take advantage of simulation, not just as the traditional tool as they may have used in the past. But as part of a broader end-to-end platform on which they can anchor their product design capabilities and of course, much more. And it\u2019s a virtual cycle. The more they use simulation, the more they need it in the future, because with simulation, they can explore these new edge cases, boundary conditions where they couldn\u2019t have essentially done the analysis before. Now they\u2019re in a position to, because of this platform centric approach that we\u2019ve taken recently towards simulation. So that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully that gives you some perspective. We\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about things like simulation data management, materials design, all of these are essential aspects of the broader platform that we\u2019re in a position to support for our customers. The other broad area, as you\u2019ve seen from what we\u2019ve talked about in the past has been investment in supporting the hyperscalers. So supporting cloud computing, investing in supporting some of the latest hardware GPUs, scale out CPUs, all of that again makes simulation much more relevant and continues to be areas where we\u2019re investing as we support our customers, dealing with the complexity that they\u2019re working with. And then finally, I\u2019ll make the point that we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s not just about using simulation in the validation of products. We see the opportunity to take simulation more broadly and take the insight from simulation and make that available. So if you look at things like mission engineering, as an example, those are all areas where \u2013 those are areas in discovery. All of that is taking us to areas digital twin, taking us to areas where simulation opens new market opportunities for us as well. So that\u2019s reflective in our investments, Jay and certainly we see the increased opportunity for simulation out there and our investments parallel down.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And Jay, on your cash flow question, as you know, cash flow is more highly correlated to ACV than to revenue because of the financial model transition that we\u2019ve been undergoing and that transition to those highly recurring subscription leases. And in terms of the operating leverage in particular, the dynamics around working capital I think that you start to see this in our 2022 guidance. You could see that the operating leverage in the business is from the operating cash flow, right? So ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue. And cash flow is expected to grow faster than ACV. And what\u2019s driving that underlying dynamic is really kind of the acceleration of that subscription lease business and the underlying annuity that gets generated from it, which generates cash collections. And there's a slightly different revenue recognition profile behind those because that revenue recognition is 50/50.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Yes. Thank you. Thank you both. That covers it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. We can hear you.\nOperator: Yes, sir. You may proceed.\nTyler Radke: Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks so much. Good morning. So, AJei, you talked a lot about sustainability in your opening remarks this quarter and excuse me \u2013 I'm just curious how much more just in terms of your conversations is this coming up is a key driver to your business and obviously simulation kind of by definition helps on the sustainability effort by reducing physical testing needs. But maybe just give us a sense for how you're thinking about the ability for this conversation to drive more awareness and accelerate growth for ANSYS. And then I have a quick follow up for Nicole. Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, Tyler, thanks for the question. So as you rightly point out, the historical use of simulation has been in the product design area and there's clearly value because we\u2019ve reduced the number of physical prototypes. That's obviously more sustainable. We can make products more efficient and so forth. I mean, that's been the historical value that we've provided. What's been happening of course, in the recent past, certainly in the last few years is the focus on sustainability. And we've seen this, as I mentioned briefly in my remarks in the script earlier, we've seen this manifest in different industries in different ways. And certainly in the automotive industry, we've seen this with electric cars, battery technology, and trying to figure out what comes after or what replaces the internal combustion engine or how \u2013 what the transition of the future of the automobile looks like. So there's been that one set of discussions. The other sets of areas where we've continued to have conversations with customers for a number of years has been on other forms of energy. So things like wind, solar, title, these are other important areas outside of the traditional hydrocarbon ecosystem. And of course, we've talked about things like lightweighting and so on for a while. These conversations have continued and they continue with more and more urgency. And certainly as you start to look at the broader discussions that are taking place right now around the geopolitical climate, the focus on energy, I think comes back and we're having these conversations with energy companies as to how they can be more efficient or how customers can be more efficient. And so, we see this as an ongoing customer requirement that continues to gain momentum and it's a long-term tailwind for us that we are able to respond to. So we are excited that we can support the industry as they think about these sustainability initiatives, frankly, across multiple industry verticals.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. And maybe a quick follow up question. So obviously ACV performance in Q1 adjusting for currency was in line with your guidance. You raised the full year outlook, operationally the Russia headwind, just help us understand what gives you the confidence to do that, a lot of businesses out there are taking a bit more of a conservative posture given everything come out. So was it something you saw in the quarter in terms of improvement versus your expectations or what's kind of preventing you from taking more of a conservative posture on the guide? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, I mean, I think \u2013 thanks, Tyler. I think as you know, kind of our approach to guidance is kind of, is to quarter by quarter, update you on the full year. We're very focused on the full year number and take things as we see them right. And so what you saw in Q1 was that we had an incredibly strong start to the year with 11% constant currency growth that was off of a pretty exceptional 2021 with a lot of momentum building out of the back end of the year. And so while there were the dynamics that were discussed in the prepared remarks that we just shared around the elimination of Russian, Belarus and the currency headwinds underneath it, the core business momentum continues to be strong. And I think it really is emblematic of the value that we create independent of what is occurring in the macro environment. I think the sustainability example that you and Ajei just discussed, I think is a perfect example of the complexity of the problems that our customers are trying to solve. That really plays to our unique strengths. I mean, our unique strength is that we can solve problems from the component level all the way through the mission level and the more complex the problem, the more we are able to solve it in a highly differentiated way, relatively alternatives out there. And so we provide a lot of certainty and a lot of \u2013 and the ability to help our customers kind of traverse some of these more challenging product problems that they're facing. And so to me, it's just the overall strength of the business that continues to consistently deliver. And just the focus we've had on our customers throughout the pandemic, the focus that we've had on our portfolio over the past five years is really what gives us confidence in the full year view.\nTyler Radke: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I maybe wanted to just start with your outlook within your SMB customer base and how you're thinking about this. I think this is where \u2013 there was the economic sensitivities in 2020 and so I'm wondering if you're thinking about this exposure any differently just given the current macro backdrop.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean, currently, we are not seeing \u2013 so again, kind of to the point that I made to Tyler, our outlook is based on the kind of forecast of the business that we see today. We did not see any kind of meaningful shift in the underlying momentum or the underlying opportunity set in front of us in that space. And so our outlook does consider kind of continued business as usual. Last year, there was a pretty big resurgence back post COVID towards the back end of the year. It's kind of normalized towards more normalized purchasing behavior and business behavior in the SMB space. And so, that's essentially what we're considering on a go-forward basis, but we continue to monitor the situation. And if we were to see any changes, we would certainly update you.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. And then as a follow-up, when I try to reconcile ACV growth by end market, it seems your high-tech business is up maybe high teens over the LTM period even if I remove M&A. When I think about R&D spending in high tech, it's maybe more like low teens growth. Can you maybe, if this thinking is correct, help reconcile the ANSYS outperformance?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I mean, let me just quickly try to address that. When you think about our portfolio for high tech, we have a differentiated portfolio and once again, it's focused on the simulation aspects of that. And as I've mentioned before, as products get more complex, the need for simulation continues to grow. And so, when you're dealing with next-generation telecommunications, for example, you need very accurate simulation capabilities. That's where products like ANSYS HFSS come in. In big industry trends like electrification, the entire end-to-end electric Motor Design tool chain is absolutely essential. That's an example of an area where, as I mentioned in my remarks, we just recently announced \u2013 within the last day or so, we recently announced an acquisition of Motor Design, again helping in that end-to-end electrification tool chain. So we have been very careful to not only have \u2013 invest in our products so that they're \u2013 we feel that they're best in breed, but we've also been investing in our products to \u2013 in areas where customers are really struggling in areas like next-generation telecommunications. The other interesting thing, of course, is that there's a connection between our semiconductor offerings and our broader simulation capabilities. As customers in the semiconductor world are looking at 2.5 and 3D integrated circuits, that's when a \u2013 that's when you start to see the use of tools and technologies like the more traditional ANSYS simulation capabilities in the semiconductor domain as well. And so that crossover as well represents a long-term tailwind for us. So we feel like we are well positioned with our portfolio. We've been making the right investments and the right levels of integrations to allow our customers to solve some of the problems in the areas where they're investing, in some of the most challenging areas with these highly complex products for the future. And so, that's why we feel very good about our high tech business.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And just to kind of answer your question on the growth point that you asked. So as you know, we don't give growth by industry, but in the industry disclosure, you do see that on a trailing 12-month basis, as a percentage, high-tech and A&D represent a higher amount and they continue to be our largest contributors to the business as well.\nJoe Vruwink: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrew Obin: Hi, good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: I guess my first is not going to be a question. It's going to be more of a statement and confirmation. I just want to make sure 11% constant currency growth was better than the mid-point of your ACV guidance, right? Is that correct? Because somebody said you didn't beat the numbers, but I thought it was better than your guide, midpoint of your guide. Is that a fair statement?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, absolutely, it was better than \u2013 you're talking about the Q1 number?\nAndrew Obin: Yes.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes.\nAndrew Obin: Okay. I was confused there for a second. Okay, fine.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. No, no, no. It was actually well exceeded the midpoint of our guidance.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, yes. No. because that's what I thought. Okay, fine.\nNicole Anasenes: Given the midpoint was, what 9% in Q1 \u2013 yes. I just remember, yes, the midpoint was 9% in Q1 and coming in at 11% constant currency is quite significantly over that.\nAndrew Obin: Excellent, thank you, just making sure. So yes, the question going back to the trailing 12 month ACV chart, we've been getting questions on your aerospace and defense exposure, and it does show that up to 21 over 19 versus a year ago. And a) just trying to understand what's driving it and just to I appreciate that the stuff you do sort of longer cycle in nature. But how should we think commercial aerospace recovery and on top of it what looks like globally higher \u2013 structurally higher defense budget in U.S. and Europe given what's happening in Ukraine should impact your aerospace and defense business over the next 12 to 24 months?\nAjei Gopal: Aerospace and defense is one of our top three verticals. And as you heard in my comments, we're seeing \u2013 we saw good performance in Q1 and we're also seeing increased activity with customers in the aerospace and defense market most recently. So these global events certainly cause conversations with customers. And then while it's too early to declare, I think it's pretty clear that these increased activity is a good indicator of longer-term tailwinds for our business from those conversations. But our business in aerospace and defense is very broad, and it's, again, based on the overall capabilities of our portfolio and what we can bring to the table.\nAndrew Obin: All right, terrific. And then just trying to understand, looking at the auto business and some of your disclosures that indicate that German and Japanese businesses have sort of shrunk, should I be thinking that lower share of auto and decline in Germany and Japan, does that go \u2013 should I be thinking is that it's German and Japan automakers? Or is there something else going on?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So let me comment on the revenue growth in those markets. I'll let Ajei give more commentary on the market dynamics. So the \u2013 in the quarter, so first, those two, at an actual rate basis, they're going to have the most disproportionate impact on the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar and the euro weakening against the dollar, but so there is a significant impact there. The other thing, just to note, in general, is that the revenue variability because of license mix and differences in license mix on a year-to-year comparative basis can be quite volatile. And so, when you look at a quarter, even at the ANSYS level, there could be a lot of volatility within the quarter. Once you get to the country level, the quarterly numbers are quite volatile. So, it's not \u2013 so the quarterly number is not necessarily an indicator of kind of broader dynamics that are happening in the environment.\nAndrew Obin: Got you and that's also where we see FX. I should have thought about that. Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nSaket Kalia: Hi, good morning. Ajei, maybe I'll start with you. I wonder if you could talk about the OnScale acquisition a little bit. I think it happened in the beginning of the quarter. How does that sort of fit into the high-performance computing portfolio that ANSYS has? And any thoughts on just \u2013 or understanding it's early, any thoughts on how you sort of take that to market and whether that's \u2013 on how you take that to market rather and whether that's different than how ANSYS currently goes to market?\nAjei Gopal: So, Saket, there are two important elements to our cloud strategy. The first is location independence and the second is device independence. And so, let me start with location independence, and let me take you back to that last earnings call we had, when I think in answer to a question I described how our products take advantage of the cloud and what's important to customers. And then as you alluded to in your question, I pointed to how simulation is different from the typical enterprise application in that the amount of compute that's required for simulation can be enormous. And I said a single simulation could run for hours across hundreds of cores, single user could launch multiple simulations in parallel and that's why high-performance computing, or HPC, is so important to us and our customers. And I talked about our strategy to support our customers as they use ANSYS products and take advantage of high-performance computing in the public cloud of their choice. We talked in that response about ANSYS Cloud. I talked about how that allows our customers to use our flagship products, while taking advantage of compute power in the Azure Cloud while running on the managed instance from ANSYS. And we also talked about ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS, which allows customers to pair their hardware access with AWS with their ANSYS flagship software. So in other words, last time, I talked about how our cloud strategy supports our full-featured products that supports our full-featured user interfaces for those products while providing location-independent high-performance computing for ANSYS solvers. So the recent announcement coming to your question with OnScale is really part of the next leg of our strategy, which is to allow access to ANSYS solver technology in a device independent manner through a browser. So OnScale, as you know, had created an exciting SaaS offering that coupled a simple web and intuitive web user interface to simulation with cloud-native infrastructure. And so now to your point and your question, now that OnScale is part of ANSYS, we will continue to enhance that front end, of course. And we will supplement that with back-end access to the ANSYS flagship solvers in the cloud. In other words, we will enable customer access to our industry-leading solvers through a SaaS experience through a browser interface in a device independent manner. And so this allows us to provide also in the future a SaaS option to simulation, one that might be attracted to new users in small and medium business or in areas that have not traditionally used ANSYS flagship products, so maybe even new users in existing customers. So when you add all of that together, our cloud strategy is to provide customers with device-independent and location-independent access to really the best and most comprehensive set of multiphysics simulation capabilities in the market.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Nicole, maybe just for a quick follow-up, just housekeeping, can you just remind us how much you're including an ACV for inorganic this year and I \u2013 and whether it includes the Motor Design acquisition? I just wanted to check kind of how much that constant currency ACV growth is on an organic basis. I don't think there is too much inorganic this year, but just to make sure it's asked.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, you're correct. And let me kind of take you through the description of that. So as you know, we increased the ACV guidance this quarter by $35 million operationally, and that translates to about a point of constant currency growth that brings us to 11% constant currency growth at the midpoint. The basis of that increase is based on the increased organic momentum in the business. And then we've previously mentioned that \u2013 and it was in our prior guidance that we expect the inorganic contribution of Zemax to be around $20 million of ACV. And then our two recent acquisitions, OnScale and Motor Design, both of them are immaterial contributors to the top-line. OnScale is an early-stage technology acquisition with minimal revenue. And Motor Design, as discussed in the press release, Motor Design and ANSYS had a prior partnership, where we were the primary OEM of the product. So there is de minimis incremental top line benefit from the acquisition this year. So now while the initial financial contributions are not material of these two things, yes, we're really excited about the long-term impact of these investments to accelerate two really important aspects of our roadmap, as Ajei discussed, the cloud roadmap as well as the electrification roadmap, which connects to the sustainability conversation we had earlier today. So I mean that \u2013 so our guidance still reflects the $20 million of ACV contribution from Zemax, which would put us around 10% constant currency growth in ACV when you exclude Zemax from the full year outlook, which again is on the business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. The other thing, just to note, is that as it relates to operating margin and cash flow. The net of these two acquisitions actually had a negative impact on both operating margin and cash flow, but we've absorbed \u2013 we've fully absorbed the negative impact in the full year guidance that you received.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That's all really helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Borg from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\nAdam Borg: Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question and the details about the guidance and also the details on the inorganic contribution, maybe just on the MDL acquisition. So obviously, as you talked about, you guys have had a partnership for a couple of years. It's already been established in our go-to-market motion. So I'd love to understand why decide to buy it versus just [indiscernible] partner. And then more broadly, this helps you get deeper in some respects into CAD. I'm just thinking about is there an opportunity for you to get deeper into CAD and other areas of the design market. Thanks so much.\nAjei Gopal: So I'm excited about the acquisition of Motor Design as I've said. We've had a successful partnership for a couple of years. They're the best-in-class solution in the market targeting the electric motor and machine market. And obviously, with the increased demand in electric vehicles, the complexity of electric motors, they bring a lot to the table. What we have is a seamless tool chain that includes Motor-CAD that connects that into other elements of our simulation portfolio. So for example, we have connections with ANSYS Discovery, with Maxwell, with Fluent with mechanical. So it's really connected to the full suite of our multiphysics capabilities. And so acquiring motor design really gives us the ability to control that product road map and drive greater levels of product integration across our portfolio. Obviously, as an independent company, they have their own objectives, but now that they're part of ANSYS, we'll be in a position to really streamline that end-to-end and support that seamless shift left in the multiphysics workflow that we have around Electric Motors. So we're excited about that. We're excited about that. And you see that \u2013 the importance of that streamlined workflow. Scheffler, for example, a customer of ours, they had coupled Motor-CAD with ANSYS OPTIS line, which gives us the optimization solutions. And now what you're seeing is a much better design to validation workflow for electric machines. And that kind of capability becomes possible when we have greater visibility into the road map, and we're in a position to be able to drive that organically out from the R&D organization. So we're excited about the acquisition. I think it's a great acquisition, and the team is very strong.\nAdam Borg: That's really helpful. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, so congrats to Walt on the promotion. I know it just happened and it's still really early, but any initial observations on any planned go-to-market changes as you think about a change at the top of the helm? Thanks again.\nAjei Gopal: Well, as I said in my comments, Walt is a long-time ANSYS executive, and he has been \u2013 I mean he has just a tremendous track record of success within ANSYS. He's been running our largest and fastest-growing region in the Americas. He's intimately involved in all aspects of our go-to-market. He's dealt with some of the largest contracts in the enterprise space. He's been involved in the go-to-market transformation. He has spearheaded some of the inside sales efforts. He knows the industry. He knows our products. So he's been intimately involved in the creation of our strategy, and I'm excited about his leadership. He was a clear choice to move our sales teams forward. We have an exceptional deep bench of talent here at ANSYS. And I'm really excited about the future.\nAdam Borg: Super clear. Thanks again.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. And Mr. Celino, it's possible that your phone is on mute.\nJason Celino: Oh, sorry about that. That's embarrassing. Thanks for getting me in. Europe is on everyone's minds. I'm curious on what trends you're seeing there and how the pipeline is shaping up. And then maybe more pointed, what would have EMEA grown if it didn't exclude any of the sanction impact in the quarter? Thanks.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So I mean, overall, with our \u2013 in Q1, we saw constant currency growth of 8% in the end of the first quarter, which was pretty strong. We saw industrial \u2013 the industrial equipment industry, in particular, is quite strong, and we saw relatively strong demand in A&D overall. And so the impact of the overall impact of Russia in full year of $15 million on revenue was a couple of million dollars in Q1.\nJason Celino: Okay. Excellent. Thank you for that. And then I guess, really quickly, the hiring environment remains relatively tight, especially for software sales. How are hiring plans going? And how do you feel about capacity and productivity heading into the second half? Thanks.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So our Q1 pace of hiring came in as expected, and it was at a higher rate than we did in Q1 2021. So we're planning to continue to ramp up hiring in Q2 and second half as planned.\nJason Celino: Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Matthew Broome from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nMatthew Broome: Okay. Thanks very much. So ANSYS is obviously \u2013 it's a mature company, but is there still a sort of significant greenfield opportunity for simulation within your sort of legacy sort of customer bases? And do you view sustainability as sort of part of that?\nAjei Gopal: Yes. ANSYS has been around \u2013 we're proud of the fact that, as a company, we've been around for 50 years. And so from that extent \u2013 to that extent, we're one of the longer-tenured, if you will, software companies out there. But the reality is that the technology that we deliver and the value proposition that we deliver, which is helping our customers to be able to drive top-line growth by bringing product to market faster and achieve bottom line savings through cost savings in terms of testing and validation to reduce warranty costs, more increased efficiency, all of those are evergreen value propositions. And as I've said before, as products become more complicated and you're seeing this, every single product is getting significantly more sophisticated than products of the past, it's not just a matter of solving a particular or understanding a particular discipline like structures of fluids. It's understanding the interplay between all of these different capabilities. So you take something like a car. A car today is a very different beast than the car was \u2013 the internal combustion engine human-driven car was a number of years ago. If you think about an autonomous vehicle, for example, that's powered by an Electric Motor, it calls for different skills and capabilities. And look, we are excited that we are in a position to support our customers as they go through this journey. So the ongoing value of simulation is really there \u2013 is driven, one, by virtue of the fact that we make \u2013 the more simulation you run, the better your product. And so there is a continued demand for customers [Audio Dip] environment with new products run. And the product complexity continues to drive that. And the final point I want to make here is when you think about the use of simulation when you start to use simulation within a company, you start to rely on it more and more, and it's a virtuous cycle for ANSYS. And so there are examples of changes, where in the past, where you may not have necessarily done a detailed design if there was an incremental change, which may have led to some warranty issues or things of that nature. Today, companies who are using ANSYS are in a position to just run simulation to validate that those \u2013 what might seem less small incremental changes haven't really fundamentally made a difference. When supply chains get disrupted and you want to swap out one component for a different component, that's requires analysis and validation, and that's again what simulation can provide. So the value proposition and the use of simulation is \u2013 continues to be strong. And then, of course, areas like sustainability, electrification, autonomy, IoT, telecommunications. These are all areas where customers are spending enormous amounts of effort, energy and money trying to build next-generation capabilities, and once again, we're in a position to help them. So I'm very excited about the opportunity in the future of simulation and of ANSYS.\nMatthew Broome: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNicole Anasenes: That is all the time we have today. I will turn it over to Ajei for closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: I am excited about our strong start to 2022. Our strong execution and industry-leading multiphysics portfolio, combined with strong customer demand, gives me confidence as we plan for the rest of the year and beyond. I want to thank my ANSYS colleagues for their stellar execution and for their commitment, which produced these great results. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and please enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm happy to report that Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS. We again beat across all our key metrics and grew ACV by nearly 11% in constant currency. We believe that this continued momentum, combined with our strong customer relationships and leading multiphysics product suite, will set the tone for Q2 and the rest of the year. These strong results came in the midst of continued disruptions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has spurred additional lockdowns in certain regions as well as geopolitical dynamics. As we have previously announced, we have suspended all new and ongoing business with Russia and Belarus and removed them from our 2022 forecast. ANSYS has contributed to the Ukrainian relief efforts, and our hearts go out to all those affected by these tragic events. We are not only absorbing the headwinds from sanctions, but based on the strength of the forecast and the ongoing demand for our multiphysics solutions, we are increasing our operational outlook on ACV, revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes, including a discussion of the impact of global currency exchange rates on our outlook. Focusing now on Q1. From a revenue perspective, we saw good growth, as expected, across all our geographies, led by the Americas and Asia Pacific. The demand for ANSYS simulation has been relatively consistent across industries for the last several years. Given recent events and market conditions, we are now seeing an increased activity in energy and sustainability initiatives, which I will discuss in a few minutes, and in aerospace and defense accounts. Our largest contract for the quarter was a three year $44 million agreement with a North American defense contractor. This long-time customer is using our broad solution set to power its digital transformation through integrated digital engineering, multidisciplinary design optimization and digital mission engineering. The customer is realizing a strong return on its investment in ANSYS by helping it to win new government contracts while driving cost out of its organization. On these calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several calls, I have discussed the unparalleled scalability of our best-in-class fluid products. I highlighted the critical role that ANSYS solutions are playing in the development of next-generation semiconductors, and I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. For this call, I would like to discuss the critical role that ANSYS plays in sustainability. Sustainability is a crucial and complex topic that crosses industries and one that plays to ANSYS' strengths in multiphysics simulation. ANSYS simulation has traditionally enabled companies to save resources and energy before physical products are ever built, thanks to virtual prototyping. Today, though, through the use of our broad multiphysics portfolio, we can enable a number of our customers' sustainability initiatives, too many, in fact, to mention on this call. Let me give you just three representative examples so you have a sense as to the role that simulation is playing in sustainability: first, in increasing fuel efficiency; next, in driving electrification; and finally, in decreasing the rates of emissions. Let me start with fuel and energy efficiency, where a variety of ANSYS multiphysics products are being used to solve challenges ranging from engine effectiveness to electric battery design. The outcomes from these initiatives are reducing dependence on pollution producing fossil fuels. We announced earlier this week that we are working with Safran Aircraft Engines to support its aviation sustainability efforts while advancing productivity and cost efficiency. Using ANSYS' structural and thermal solutions for an advanced open fan architecture, new materials and hybrid electrification capabilities, the company expects to reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions by more than 20% when compared to today's most efficient engines. Similarly, in Q4, we announced a new five year enterprise license agreement with LG Electronics to support the company's sustainability initiatives. ANSYS' multiphysics solutions are enabling more resource-efficient production that makes product development more sustainable by significantly reducing material use, costs and multiple redesigns. For example, ANSYS' virtual model offers one to three decoupling to support the development of the compressors used in LG's home appliances. As a result, LG Electronics can introduce its next-generation products faster than ever while accelerating its digital transformation and decreasing its carbon footprint. Turning to electrification. Customers are employing ANSYS solutions to improve the efficiency of electric motors, which today consume over 45% of the world's electricity. For example, in Q1, we signed a multiyear contract with Turntide Technologies, which develops solutions that accelerate electrification and sustainable operations for energy-intensive industries. Turntide is a long-time ANSYS user and this new contract broadens the company's use of multiphysics simulation to optimize product and engineering efficiency while reducing the need for physical prototyping as well as cutting development time and costs. On past calls, I've discussed the use of ANSYS solutions in the development of electric cars. In Q1, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team won the top two spots at the Mexico City E-Prix, with the help of a customized powertrain developed with ANSYS technologies. Working with ANSYS, Porsche Motorsport engineers accelerated the virtual testing of design concepts to provide the best powertrain solution without using physical prototypes. The powertrain innovations used on the racetrack will spur development of energy efficient, affordable and sustainable commercial vehicles at Porsche. To compliment the ANSYS Electric machine design offering, we recently acquired Motor Design Limited by combining motor designs, Motor-CAD product with the rest of the ANSYS portfolio, we will offer customers the most comprehensive multiphysics workflow for electric machine design. This end-to-end solution will enable customers to not only design more efficient electric machines, but also apply them to more applications which will reduce the environmental impact as well as the cost. Motor Design is an established ANSYS OEM partner and is already integrated seamlessly into our go-to-market motion. Moving to emissions, ANSYS simulation is helping customers reduce their carbon footprint through the development of renewable energy sources, including wind and solar power. We recently announced that we are working with leading renewable energy company Vestas to deliver safer and more sustainable power management solutions for its wind turbine control systems. These controllers are responsible for optimizing power performance and preventing component damage across a range of wind conditions. Using our model-based software development environment, Vestas merge data from multiple sensors and created control algorithms to drive better turbine designs at lower costs. We also announced that we are working with ANSYS startup program member Synhelion to convert carbon dioxide and water into synthetic fuels including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Synhelion uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto a solar receiver that drives the thermochemical reactor that produces these sustainable fuels. Using ANSYS, this innovative company can simulate the thermo-fluid dynamics needed to design and validate its equipment despite the intense conditions caused by the searing temperatures. As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of the examples of how ANSYS simulation is fueling the sustainability initiatives of some of the most innovative organizations on the planet. You will hear even more real world sustainability use cases during our upcoming simulation world event on May 18. During simulation world, you'll also learn about the launch of Earth Rescue, our online series that will showcase other ANSYS customers use of simulation in combating the climate crisis. I encourage you to attend and to learn more about these remarkable use cases of ANSYS Simulation. Moving to ANSYS\u2019 own sustainability initiatives, in Q1, we released our corporate responsibility report. In this annual update, we focused on our core pillars of advancing sustainability through our leading multiphysics products, by investing in our employees, by operating responsibly and through our collaboration with various stakeholders. As an example of our growing ecosystem stakeholders, the University of Colorado Boulder will give engineers hands on experience by incorporating ANSYS multiphysics solutions into its new masters program in high speed digital engineering. These students will join their peers in more than 3,300 universities in 90 countries who are developing industry-ready simulation skills. Thanks to ANSYS products. To summarize, Q1 was another great quarter for ANSYS and one that will set the tone for the rest of 2022. Our continued momentum, our strong customer relationships and our best-in-class multiphysics product suite will help us drive even further success in 2022 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Nicole, I'm excited to announce that longtime ANSYS executive, Walt Hearn is now leading our global sales and customer excellence teams, replacing industry veteran Rick Mahoney. Walt has an unparalleled track record of success at ANSYS. And most recently has led our largest and fastest growing region in the Americas. He has personally overseen some of the largest contracts from our enterprise accounts and has led the modernization of our go-to-market motion. With his energy, industry knowledge, deep customer relationships and mastery of our complete product portfolio, Walt is the right executive to assume leadership of this next phase of our go-to-market journey. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Good morning, Jay, this is Ajei. Thanks for the question. So, as you rightly point out simulation is something that we\u2019ve always said is really critical for our customers. And obviously, we\u2019re seeing the greater use of simulation in the market as you\u2019ve alluded to. And the reason as you know is it comes directly from product design and the complexity that products are \u2013 customers are facing in their own products. You know, for \u2013 and as you know from your experience, simulation, when you\u2019re building a product, the more you can simulate, the more simulations you run, the better it is in terms of the product performance, the cost, the effectiveness of that product. Customers are recognizing that, and they\u2019re running more and more simulations. That\u2019s a tailwind for us. You also recognize as products become more complex, it\u2019s not just about individual physics excellence. And we certainly invest in individual physics excellence. It\u2019s also about the integration of the technologies together to be able to create a multi-physics solution and a multi-physics capability. And that\u2019s also been an area for investment for us. If you look at, for example, some of the recent investments we\u2019ve made on the platform, we\u2019ve talked a lot about clients, the APIs that we\u2019ve made available where people can write Python applications and directly invoke our simulation capabilities. And at the same time have access to the wide variety of the Python ecosystem. So those are some examples of where we\u2019re trying to make it much easier for our customers to take advantage of simulation, not just as the traditional tool as they may have used in the past. But as part of a broader end-to-end platform on which they can anchor their product design capabilities and of course, much more. And it\u2019s a virtual cycle. The more they use simulation, the more they need it in the future, because with simulation, they can explore these new edge cases, boundary conditions where they couldn\u2019t have essentially done the analysis before. Now they\u2019re in a position to, because of this platform centric approach that we\u2019ve taken recently towards simulation. So that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully that gives you some perspective. We\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about things like simulation data management, materials design, all of these are essential aspects of the broader platform that we\u2019re in a position to support for our customers. The other broad area, as you\u2019ve seen from what we\u2019ve talked about in the past has been investment in supporting the hyperscalers. So supporting cloud computing, investing in supporting some of the latest hardware GPUs, scale out CPUs, all of that again makes simulation much more relevant and continues to be areas where we\u2019re investing as we support our customers, dealing with the complexity that they\u2019re working with. And then finally, I\u2019ll make the point that we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s not just about using simulation in the validation of products. We see the opportunity to take simulation more broadly and take the insight from simulation and make that available. So if you look at things like mission engineering, as an example, those are all areas where \u2013 those are areas in discovery. All of that is taking us to areas digital twin, taking us to areas where simulation opens new market opportunities for us as well. So that\u2019s reflective in our investments, Jay and certainly we see the increased opportunity for simulation out there and our investments parallel down. Good morning, Tyler, thanks for the question. So as you rightly point out, the historical use of simulation has been in the product design area and there's clearly value because we\u2019ve reduced the number of physical prototypes. That's obviously more sustainable. We can make products more efficient and so forth. I mean, that's been the historical value that we've provided. What's been happening of course, in the recent past, certainly in the last few years is the focus on sustainability. And we've seen this, as I mentioned briefly in my remarks in the script earlier, we've seen this manifest in different industries in different ways. And certainly in the automotive industry, we've seen this with electric cars, battery technology, and trying to figure out what comes after or what replaces the internal combustion engine or how \u2013 what the transition of the future of the automobile looks like. So there's been that one set of discussions. The other sets of areas where we've continued to have conversations with customers for a number of years has been on other forms of energy. So things like wind, solar, title, these are other important areas outside of the traditional hydrocarbon ecosystem. And of course, we've talked about things like lightweighting and so on for a while. These conversations have continued and they continue with more and more urgency. And certainly as you start to look at the broader discussions that are taking place right now around the geopolitical climate, the focus on energy, I think comes back and we're having these conversations with energy companies as to how they can be more efficient or how customers can be more efficient. And so, we see this as an ongoing customer requirement that continues to gain momentum and it's a long-term tailwind for us that we are able to respond to. So we are excited that we can support the industry as they think about these sustainability initiatives, frankly, across multiple industry verticals. Well, I mean, let me just quickly try to address that. When you think about our portfolio for high tech, we have a differentiated portfolio and once again, it's focused on the simulation aspects of that. And as I've mentioned before, as products get more complex, the need for simulation continues to grow. And so, when you're dealing with next-generation telecommunications, for example, you need very accurate simulation capabilities. That's where products like ANSYS HFSS come in. In big industry trends like electrification, the entire end-to-end electric Motor Design tool chain is absolutely essential. That's an example of an area where, as I mentioned in my remarks, we just recently announced \u2013 within the last day or so, we recently announced an acquisition of Motor Design, again helping in that end-to-end electrification tool chain. So we have been very careful to not only have \u2013 invest in our products so that they're \u2013 we feel that they're best in breed, but we've also been investing in our products to \u2013 in areas where customers are really struggling in areas like next-generation telecommunications. The other interesting thing, of course, is that there's a connection between our semiconductor offerings and our broader simulation capabilities. As customers in the semiconductor world are looking at 2.5 and 3D integrated circuits, that's when a \u2013 that's when you start to see the use of tools and technologies like the more traditional ANSYS simulation capabilities in the semiconductor domain as well. And so that crossover as well represents a long-term tailwind for us. So we feel like we are well positioned with our portfolio. We've been making the right investments and the right levels of integrations to allow our customers to solve some of the problems in the areas where they're investing, in some of the most challenging areas with these highly complex products for the future. And so, that's why we feel very good about our high tech business. Good morning. Aerospace and defense is one of our top three verticals. And as you heard in my comments, we're seeing \u2013 we saw good performance in Q1 and we're also seeing increased activity with customers in the aerospace and defense market most recently. So these global events certainly cause conversations with customers. And then while it's too early to declare, I think it's pretty clear that these increased activity is a good indicator of longer-term tailwinds for our business from those conversations. But our business in aerospace and defense is very broad, and it's, again, based on the overall capabilities of our portfolio and what we can bring to the table. So, Saket, there are two important elements to our cloud strategy. The first is location independence and the second is device independence. And so, let me start with location independence, and let me take you back to that last earnings call we had, when I think in answer to a question I described how our products take advantage of the cloud and what's important to customers. And then as you alluded to in your question, I pointed to how simulation is different from the typical enterprise application in that the amount of compute that's required for simulation can be enormous. And I said a single simulation could run for hours across hundreds of cores, single user could launch multiple simulations in parallel and that's why high-performance computing, or HPC, is so important to us and our customers. And I talked about our strategy to support our customers as they use ANSYS products and take advantage of high-performance computing in the public cloud of their choice. We talked in that response about ANSYS Cloud. I talked about how that allows our customers to use our flagship products, while taking advantage of compute power in the Azure Cloud while running on the managed instance from ANSYS. And we also talked about ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS, which allows customers to pair their hardware access with AWS with their ANSYS flagship software. So in other words, last time, I talked about how our cloud strategy supports our full-featured products that supports our full-featured user interfaces for those products while providing location-independent high-performance computing for ANSYS solvers. So the recent announcement coming to your question with OnScale is really part of the next leg of our strategy, which is to allow access to ANSYS solver technology in a device independent manner through a browser. So OnScale, as you know, had created an exciting SaaS offering that coupled a simple web and intuitive web user interface to simulation with cloud-native infrastructure. And so now to your point and your question, now that OnScale is part of ANSYS, we will continue to enhance that front end, of course. And we will supplement that with back-end access to the ANSYS flagship solvers in the cloud. In other words, we will enable customer access to our industry-leading solvers through a SaaS experience through a browser interface in a device independent manner. And so this allows us to provide also in the future a SaaS option to simulation, one that might be attracted to new users in small and medium business or in areas that have not traditionally used ANSYS flagship products, so maybe even new users in existing customers. So when you add all of that together, our cloud strategy is to provide customers with device-independent and location-independent access to really the best and most comprehensive set of multiphysics simulation capabilities in the market. So I'm excited about the acquisition of Motor Design as I've said. We've had a successful partnership for a couple of years. They're the best-in-class solution in the market targeting the electric motor and machine market. And obviously, with the increased demand in electric vehicles, the complexity of electric motors, they bring a lot to the table. What we have is a seamless tool chain that includes Motor-CAD that connects that into other elements of our simulation portfolio. So for example, we have connections with ANSYS Discovery, with Maxwell, with Fluent with mechanical. So it's really connected to the full suite of our multiphysics capabilities. And so acquiring motor design really gives us the ability to control that product road map and drive greater levels of product integration across our portfolio. Obviously, as an independent company, they have their own objectives, but now that they're part of ANSYS, we'll be in a position to really streamline that end-to-end and support that seamless shift left in the multiphysics workflow that we have around Electric Motors. So we're excited about that. We're excited about that. And you see that \u2013 the importance of that streamlined workflow. Scheffler, for example, a customer of ours, they had coupled Motor-CAD with ANSYS OPTIS line, which gives us the optimization solutions. And now what you're seeing is a much better design to validation workflow for electric machines. And that kind of capability becomes possible when we have greater visibility into the road map, and we're in a position to be able to drive that organically out from the R&D organization. So we're excited about the acquisition. I think it's a great acquisition, and the team is very strong. Well, as I said in my comments, Walt is a long-time ANSYS executive, and he has been \u2013 I mean he has just a tremendous track record of success within ANSYS. He's been running our largest and fastest-growing region in the Americas. He's intimately involved in all aspects of our go-to-market. He's dealt with some of the largest contracts in the enterprise space. He's been involved in the go-to-market transformation. He has spearheaded some of the inside sales efforts. He knows the industry. He knows our products. So he's been intimately involved in the creation of our strategy, and I'm excited about his leadership. He was a clear choice to move our sales teams forward. We have an exceptional deep bench of talent here at ANSYS. And I'm really excited about the future. Yes. ANSYS has been around \u2013 we're proud of the fact that, as a company, we've been around for 50 years. And so from that extent \u2013 to that extent, we're one of the longer-tenured, if you will, software companies out there. But the reality is that the technology that we deliver and the value proposition that we deliver, which is helping our customers to be able to drive top-line growth by bringing product to market faster and achieve bottom line savings through cost savings in terms of testing and validation to reduce warranty costs, more increased efficiency, all of those are evergreen value propositions.

It's understanding the interplay between all of these different capabilities. So you take something like a car. A car today is a very different beast than the car was \u2013 the internal combustion engine human-driven car was a number of years ago. If you think about an autonomous vehicle, for example, that's powered by an Electric Motor, it calls for different skills and capabilities. And look, we are excited that we are in a position to support our customers as they go through this journey. So the ongoing value of simulation is really there \u2013 is driven, one, by virtue of the fact that we make \u2013 the more simulation you run, the better your product. And so there is a continued demand for customers [Audio Dip] environment with new products run. And the product complexity continues to drive that. And the final point I want to make here is when you think about the use of simulation when you start to use simulation within a company, you start to rely on it more and more, and it's a virtuous cycle for ANSYS. And so there are examples of changes, where in the past, where you may not have necessarily done a detailed design if there was an incremental change, which may have led to some warranty issues or things of that nature. Today, companies who are using ANSYS are in a position to just run simulation to validate that those \u2013 what might seem less small incremental changes haven't really fundamentally made a difference. When supply chains get disrupted and you want to swap out one component for a different component, that's requires analysis and validation, and that's again what simulation can provide. So the value proposition and the use of simulation is \u2013 continues to be strong. And then, of course, areas like sustainability, electrification, autonomy, IoT, telecommunications. These are all areas where customers are spending enormous amounts of effort, energy and money trying to build next-generation capabilities, and once again, we're in a position to help them. So I'm very excited about the opportunity in the future of simulation and of ANSYS. I am excited about our strong start to 2022. Our strong execution and industry-leading multiphysics portfolio, combined with strong customer demand, gives me confidence as we plan for the rest of the year and beyond. I want to thank my ANSYS colleagues for their stellar execution and for their commitment, which produced these great results. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today, and please enjoy the rest of the day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some additional perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2022. The first quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered robust growth during the quarter and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV was strong and revenue operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our Q1 guidance, driven by the mix of license types sold on the quarter. Now let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Q1 ACV was $344.1 million and grew year-over-year 8% or 11% in constant currency. We saw strong performance across most geographic regions and industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 16% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. Q1 total revenue with $428.6 million and grew 15% or 18% in constant currency, which as I mentioned, exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by the timing of perpetual license deals that closed in the quarter. Q1 revenue growth was broad based across geographies. We had strong top line performance in Q1 with ACV and revenue, both growing double-digit and constant currency at 11% and 18% respectively. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.2 billion, which grew 28% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter growth margin of 89.6% and an operating margin of 34.7%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue. The result with first quarter EPS of $1.36, which was also better than our guidance, similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18%. The tax rate we expect for the remainder of 2022. Our cash flow from operations in the first quarter totaled $210.9 million, which benefited from strong collections. We ended the quarter with $657.8 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares during the quarter for around $156 million. We have 2 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Although Russia and Belarus are not material in size to our overall business, we have fully absorbed the removal of Russia and Belarus from our outlook for the remainder of the year given the sanctions. The momentum of our business exceeds this impact. And as a result, we are operationally increasing our outlook on ACV revenue, EPS and operating cash flow for the full year. The underlying momentum in our business is strong. We delivered a robust Q1 coming off a great Q4 2021. And our strong 2022 forecast reflects our continued breadth and depth of customer demand. However, offsetting that strong outlook is significant U.S. dollar strengthening, which impacts the exchange rate embedded in our guidance. Let me start with our full year 2022 guidance. We are updating our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $1.960 billion to $2.020 billion. This represents growth of 4.8% to 8% or 9.2% to 12.4% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance by 1 point of constant currency growth compared to our February guidance. This raise is driven by the strong ACV performance we saw on Q1 and improved forecast we see for the rest of the year. That underlying improvement drove a full year ACV operational increase of $35 million relative to our February guidance. This operational momentum was offset by absorbing $18 million of Russia and Belarus business and $47 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.65 billion, which is growth of 3.8% to 6.9% or 8% to 11.1% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth. Relative to our February guidance, our full year revenue increased $20 million from operational performance, which was offset by absorbing $15 million from Russia and Belarus and $45 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result, we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $7.53 to $7.94. Relative to our February guidance, our full year EPS increased around $0.25 from better operational performance and lower share count, which was offset by absorbing $0.14 from Russia and Belarus and $0.24 of foreign exchange headwind. Now let me turn to our full year operating cash flow guidance. Our 2022 outlook is a range of $570 million to $610 million, which as discussed with our February guidance includes the $60 million to $80 million of cash timing impact of R&E capitalization regulations that are in effect as of January 1, 2022. Relative to our February guidance, our full year operating cash flow increased $20 million from better operational performance, which was offset by absorbing $12 million from Russia and Belarus collections and $18 million of foreign exchange headwind. Since January 2022, we have seen significant U.S. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and Japanese yen. The trajectory of the movement of these currencies has been outsized relative to typical currency fluctuation impacts. When compared to the 2021 currency rates, our 2022 guidance is negatively impacted on ACV by approximately $80 million and on operating cash by approximately $30 million. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business is operationally strong and has considerable momentum. Now let me turn to guidance for Q2. For the second quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $442 million to $462 million and revenue in the range of $450 million to $475 million. Our outlook implies double digit ACV constant currency growth for both the first half and full year 2022 in line with our business model of double digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. We expect Q2 operating margin in the range of 36% to 38.1% and EPS in the range of $1.46 to $1.64. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2022 and Q2 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast, diversified business model and high level of recurring ACV, all of which contribute to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum in our business as reflected in the increased outlook for constant currency ACV and revenue growth and the operational improvements in our cash flow outlook. I would like to thank the ANSYS team for a strong Q1 financial performance and for all of the efforts from not only this past quarter, but for those of the last few years, as we continue to grow, invest in our business and execute against our strategic priorities. I appreciate the can do attitude, the push for excellence and the customer centric focus of the entire team. Our people and physics-based simulation solutions have earned us our industry leading world class reputation as the go-to source to solve the most difficult problems and to create what was previously impossible. We are well positioned to deliver on our 2022 outlook and our strategic investments will propel us into the journey to enhance our value to customers, to our shareholders, and to make a world \u2013 the world a better place for years to come. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Yes. And Jay, on your cash flow question, as you know, cash flow is more highly correlated to ACV than to revenue because of the financial model transition that we\u2019ve been undergoing and that transition to those highly recurring subscription leases. And in terms of the operating leverage in particular, the dynamics around working capital I think that you start to see this in our 2022 guidance. You could see that the operating leverage in the business is from the operating cash flow, right? So ACV is expected to grow faster than revenue. And cash flow is expected to grow faster than ACV. And what\u2019s driving that underlying dynamic is really kind of the acceleration of that subscription lease business and the underlying annuity that gets generated from it, which generates cash collections. And there's a slightly different revenue recognition profile behind those because that revenue recognition is 50/50. Yes. We can hear you. Yes, I mean, I think \u2013 thanks, Tyler. I think as you know, kind of our approach to guidance is kind of, is to quarter by quarter, update you on the full year. We're very focused on the full year number and take things as we see them right. And so what you saw in Q1 was that we had an incredibly strong start to the year with 11% constant currency growth that was off of a pretty exceptional 2021 with a lot of momentum building out of the back end of the year. And so while there were the dynamics that were discussed in the prepared remarks that we just shared around the elimination of Russian, Belarus and the currency headwinds underneath it, the core business momentum continues to be strong. And I think it really is emblematic of the value that we create independent of what is occurring in the macro environment. I think the sustainability example that you and Ajei just discussed, I think is a perfect example of the complexity of the problems that our customers are trying to solve. That really plays to our unique strengths. I mean, our unique strength is that we can solve problems from the component level all the way through the mission level and the more complex the problem, the more we are able to solve it in a highly differentiated way, relatively alternatives out there. And so we provide a lot of certainty and a lot of \u2013 and the ability to help our customers kind of traverse some of these more challenging product problems that they're facing. And so to me, it's just the overall strength of the business that continues to consistently deliver. And just the focus we've had on our customers throughout the pandemic, the focus that we've had on our portfolio over the past five years is really what gives us confidence in the full year view. Yes. I mean, currently, we are not seeing \u2013 so again, kind of to the point that I made to Tyler, our outlook is based on the kind of forecast of the business that we see today. We did not see any kind of meaningful shift in the underlying momentum or the underlying opportunity set in front of us in that space. And so our outlook does consider kind of continued business as usual. Last year, there was a pretty big resurgence back post COVID towards the back end of the year. It's kind of normalized towards more normalized purchasing behavior and business behavior in the SMB space. And so, that's essentially what we're considering on a go-forward basis, but we continue to monitor the situation. And if we were to see any changes, we would certainly update you. Yes. And just to kind of answer your question on the growth point that you asked. So as you know, we don't give growth by industry, but in the industry disclosure, you do see that on a trailing 12-month basis, as a percentage, high-tech and A&D represent a higher amount and they continue to be our largest contributors to the business as well. Good morning. Yes, absolutely, it was better than \u2013 you're talking about the Q1 number? Yes. Yes. No, no, no. It was actually well exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Given the midpoint was, what 9% in Q1 \u2013 yes. I just remember, yes, the midpoint was 9% in Q1 and coming in at 11% constant currency is quite significantly over that. Yes. So let me comment on the revenue growth in those markets. I'll let Ajei give more commentary on the market dynamics. So the \u2013 in the quarter, so first, those two, at an actual rate basis, they're going to have the most disproportionate impact on the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar and the euro weakening against the dollar, but so there is a significant impact there. The other thing, just to note, in general, is that the revenue variability because of license mix and differences in license mix on a year-to-year comparative basis can be quite volatile. And so, when you look at a quarter, even at the ANSYS level, there could be a lot of volatility within the quarter. Once you get to the country level, the quarterly numbers are quite volatile. So, it's not \u2013 so the quarterly number is not necessarily an indicator of kind of broader dynamics that are happening in the environment. Yes. Good morning. Yes, you're correct. And let me kind of take you through the description of that. So as you know, we increased the ACV guidance this quarter by $35 million operationally, and that translates to about a point of constant currency growth that brings us to 11% constant currency growth at the midpoint. The basis of that increase is based on the increased organic momentum in the business. And then we've previously mentioned that \u2013 and it was in our prior guidance that we expect the inorganic contribution of Zemax to be around $20 million of ACV. And then our two recent acquisitions, OnScale and Motor Design, both of them are immaterial contributors to the top-line. OnScale is an early-stage technology acquisition with minimal revenue. And Motor Design, as discussed in the press release, Motor Design and ANSYS had a prior partnership, where we were the primary OEM of the product. So there is de minimis incremental top line benefit from the acquisition this year. So now while the initial financial contributions are not material of these two things, yes, we're really excited about the long-term impact of these investments to accelerate two really important aspects of our roadmap, as Ajei discussed, the cloud roadmap as well as the electrification roadmap, which connects to the sustainability conversation we had earlier today. So I mean that \u2013 so our guidance still reflects the $20 million of ACV contribution from Zemax, which would put us around 10% constant currency growth in ACV when you exclude Zemax from the full year outlook, which again is on the business model of double-digit growth, including tuck-in M&A. The other thing, just to note, is that as it relates to operating margin and cash flow. The net of these two acquisitions actually had a negative impact on both operating margin and cash flow, but we've absorbed \u2013 we've fully absorbed the negative impact in the full year guidance that you received. Yes. So I mean, overall, with our \u2013 in Q1, we saw constant currency growth of 8% in the end of the first quarter, which was pretty strong. We saw industrial \u2013 the industrial equipment industry, in particular, is quite strong, and we saw relatively strong demand in A&D overall. And so the impact of the overall impact of Russia in full year of $15 million on revenue was a couple of million dollars in Q1. Yes. So our Q1 pace of hiring came in as expected, and it was at a higher rate than we did in Q1 2021. So we're planning to continue to ramp up hiring in Q2 and second half as planned. Operator, we have time for one more question. That is all the time we have today. I will turn it over to Ajei for closing remarks."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President, Investor Relations. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like now to turn the conference over to Ms. DeBriyn for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our third quarter 2023 Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our third quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q4 and fiscal year 2023 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. Today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking information. Important factors that may affect our future results are discussed in our public filings. Forward-looking statements are based upon our view of the business as of today, and ANSYS undertakes no obligations to update any such information. During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In Q3, ANSYS was on track to deliver against our third quarter guidance commitments when we were notified by the U.S. Department of Commerce of additional restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities, as well as incremental approval processes and export restrictions on the sale of some ANSYS products and services to entities located in China. These incremental approval processes take the form of additional vetting of prospects located in China. They introduce delays in transacting certain orders for prospects in China, resulting in the potential loss or deferral of some business that was scheduled to be closed in Q3. As a result, we came in below our expectations in both ACV and revenue for the quarter. Despite these developments, ANSYS delivered a strong quarter marked by double-digit growth in ACV. These updated export restrictions and incremental processes will mute ANSYS\u2019 growth in China in 2023 and 2024, after which we expect our business in China to return to steady state growth. Nicole will give the specifics in a few minutes. It is important to remember that China represents only a small portion of our overall business. Given the strength of our business worldwide, I\u2019m confident in our ability to execute on our short and long-term objectives. Looking back on Q3, high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation were our top contributing industries. We saw strength in Q3 for ACV across all customer types, and our geographical performance was as expected with the exception of China as I already mentioned. Our largest contract in the quarter was a three-year eight-figure agreement with the North American aerospace and defense company that has used our solutions for years. The new agreement with this customer increases the number of users of ANSYS technology. Thanks in part to ANSYS technology, the customer has secured a key contract with the U.S. government. On our calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability initiatives as well as in the development of next generation semiconductors and how ANSYS simulation is driving fundamental changes in the commercial aerospace industry. A similar simulation power transformation is taking place in the automotive industry, which is where I\u2019d like to focus today\u2019s discussion. As you were aware, automotive and ground transportation is our third largest industry, and ANSYS is already working with over 50 of the top transportation OEMs around the world and 93 of the top 100 global automotive suppliers. Yet with all the innovation taking place within the sector, there is still significant room for ANSYS to grow through more users, more products, and more computations. ANSYS simulation is helping to usher in a new era of mobility through key \u2013 to three key areas, electrification, autonomy and driver assistance and software defined vehicles. And of course, we\u2019re also driving continued innovation in vehicle development. I\u2019ll walk through each with some pertinent examples. The first area of profound change in the industry is around electrification. From battery management systems to fuel cells to integrated electrified powertrain systems, ANSYS solutions are enabling rapid electric vehicle innovation from the components to the system levels. For example, our multiphysics battery simulation solutions provide interdisciplinary expertise at different scales. ANSYS\u2019 solutions for powertrain electrification provide a complete development flow from the system level to the software level, including system simulation, model-based development and functional safety analysis. Using ANSYS, customers have reduced battery project costs by up to 30% and design cycle times by up to 50% [ph]. Porsche Motorsports turns to ANSYS simulation to speed up development time for its electric race car. With ANSYS, the engineers from the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team optimize their cars inverter and e-motor efficiency and then test it on a virtual racetrack. Simulation has proved to be pivotal for managing the battery\u2019s temperature and maximizing the cost performance within these demanding driving conditions. The next area I\u2019d like to discuss is autonomy and driver assistance systems. While the road to truly autonomous vehicles may be a long one, the simulation driven advances required to bring this technology to market are leading to safer driving experiences today. Using ANSYS, customers are improving advanced driver assistance systems, also known as ADAS. For example, sensors play a critical role in providing human drivers as well as autonomous systems, the data they need to make intelligent and safe decisions. ANSYS solutions for lidar, radar, and cameras enable engineers to improve sensor performance to determine optimal vehicle integration configurations and to examine their behavior across a range of operational scenarios. ANSYS customer continental is using ANSYS simulation for optical integration analysis and corner case studies that are integral to the development and validation of new sensors and computer vision algorithms. ANSYS simulation is helping continental/development time and physical testing, while reducing costs and freeing up engineering resources. The next area I would like to discuss is the development of software-defined vehicles. These automobiles have features that are primarily enabled through software and can be remotely upgraded over the cars\u2019 lifetime. The market for software-defined vehicles is expected to grow from about $35 billion today to over $200 billion early in the next decade. Thanks to software-driven features for safety, infotainment and efficiency. ANSYS solutions enable these feature-rich functions through model-based, certified embedded software and code generation, electronics reliability and connectivity systems. These advances enable engineers to meet industry safety requirements faster than manual approaches and at lower costs. Longtime ANSYS customer ZF Group is using our solutions to reduce the complexity of analysis for embedded systems. These embedded systems must be capable of operating reliably and safely on a challenging environmental conditions. In the past, ZF used different tools for failure modes and effects analysis and for fault tree analysis. By standardizing on ANSYS, the company reports saving hundreds of hours on each of the many analysis projects they run. The final area I would like to mention is in vehicle development. This is a space in which ANSYS has a long history as we play a key role in such critical areas as aerodynamics, lighting, crash safety analysis, and material management for sustainability initiatives. For example, ANSYS LS-DYNA simulates crash scenarios and accurately predicts the impact on the vehicle as well as the driver and passengers. Thanks to human body models. On materials intelligence solutions enable vehicle lightweighting efforts while assessing the environmental impact of materials throughout their lifecycle. With the growth of lighting technologies and headlamps and tail lamps, ANSYS lighting solutions have reduced the need for prototypes. One of our key contracts in the quarter was with a global automotive OEM based in Europe that has standardized on ANSYS for virtual crash testing and impact analysis replacing a competitive product. The company is leveraging ANSYS simulations to help meet its goal of reducing engineering lead time by 30% and cutting the cost of physical testing by 50%. In Q3, we also signed a contract with the leading provider of automotive seeding products. This longtime customer has expanded its use of ANSYS multiphysics solutions from explicit dynamics, electromagnetics and functional safety to include mechanical, fluids and high performance computing. This expanded ANSYS footprint benefits a number of projects. For example, enabling the company to simulate the fan noise from its ventilated seats. With ANSYS technology, this automotive leader has dramatically cut development costs, reduced simulation time from days to hours, and enabled the company to respond faster and more accurately to customer requests for quotes. I\u2019d also like to mention a different kind of customer win. I\u2019m excited to congratulate ANSYS customer Oracle Red Bull Racing on an amazing season, which culminated in capturing the 2023 Formula 1 World Constructors\u2019 and World Drivers\u2019 Championships. Using ANSYS solutions, the team simulated airflow interactions with differing shapes of the car\u2019s surface, while also analyzing engine cooling intakes. As a result, the team drove away with the championship. Moving beyond the automotive industry, I\u2019m excited to announce that we have enrolled our 2000th companies as a member of the ANSYS Startup Program. As I have said in the past, while members of our Startup Program represent a small piece of our overall business, they\u2019re amongst the most innovative users of our products. And with the program\u2019s strong graduation rates more and more expand their use of ANSYS technology and become larger ANSYS customers. I\u2019m also proud that ANSYS has received a number of awards this quarter related to employee engagement and satisfaction from organizations such as Newsweek, Best Workplaces in Europe in U.S. News and World Report. These recognitions are a testament to our supportive, diverse, and inclusive culture, as well as the quality of our team around the world. In summary, Q3 was marked by an external challenge that impacted our ability to process certain transactions. Our global business remains strong and the demand for ANSYS technology is robust. That\u2019s because companies across industries rely on ANSYS to solve the most challenging problems that they\u2019re facing. These global organizations understand that ANSYS\u2019 expertise and deep and broad portfolio of multiphysics solutions can help them solve their key product and business challenges. That combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, our deep customer relationships and the ongoing strength of our pipeline give me confidence in our ability to meet our commitments. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and full year 2023. Our ability to deliver double-digit ACV constant currency growth in Q3 despite the disruption from the changes required for export compliance in China is a testament to the resilience of our business model. Our highly recurring business model, significant base of renewals, market-leading simulation portfolio and deep customer relationships, create a strong financial foundation and contribute to unwavering demand for our product. As a result, we are raising our full year ACV and revenue guidance for operational momentum in the business. This momentum is offset by impacts of incremental approval processes and export restrictions in China and foreign exchange headwinds. I'll provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV we delivered $457.5 million in Q3, which grew 12% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency. Our growth was broad-based across customer types, geographic regions and most industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 13% or 16% in constant currency on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 83% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. This annuity creates resiliency and durability in our business model. It provides a robust foundation for near and long-term growth, which enables us to navigate the impact of business disruptions that can occur from time-to-time, like the impact of the changes to export compliance that we saw in Q3. Q3 total revenue was $458.8 million and was down 3% or down 4% in constant currency, primarily due to ASC 606 dynamics given the quarterly mix of license types that generate upfront revenue recognition, which we previously discussed on our August earnings call and detailed in our Q2 prepared remarks document. During the third quarter, both ACV and revenue were below expectations. As incremental approval processes and export restrictions on certain prospects in China created a $20 million headwind. When we set our guidance range, we guide based on the pipeline and book of business that we see in front of us. During the third quarter, we saw an impact on the contracts we expected to sign due to incremental approval processes and export restrictions that were not contemplated in our Q3 guidance provided in August. As a result, our Q3 ACV and revenue results were below our guidance. Without this impact, we would have landed near the high end of our third quarter guidance on ACV and above the high end of our revenue guidance. We have a very strong track record of achieving our guidance and it was unfortunate that we were not able to achieve our guidance for ACV and revenue this quarter. We continue to have a broad and diverse business model and a strong financial foundation with significant recurring ACV. We remain optimistic on our future growth. Despite the disruption in Q3, our year-to-date ACV performance was robust with ACV growing double-digit in constant currency at 12% and broad-based growth across geographies and customer types. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.2 billion, which grew 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 34.1%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by lower expenses and the timing of some investments. The result was third quarter EPS of $1.41, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from lower expenses and the timing of some investments. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2023. Our unlevered operating cash flow in the third quarter totaled $170.6 million and was in line with expectations and continues to be supported by strong cash collections. We ended the quarter with $640 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Looking to the remainder of the year, the business continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We are updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $2.243 billion to $2.288 billion which represents growth of 10.4% to 12.6% or 11% to 13.3% in constant currency. We continue to see our ACV growth driven by our broad-based customer demand for our product. And as a result, we are operationally increasing our full year ACV by $11 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $25 million of the impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $28 million of additional foreign exchange headwinds. This $25 million China export restriction and process headwind will mute ANSYS' growth in China in 2023, and includes some timing and loss of business impact. Despite the impact from China, our ACV growth outlook for the full year is 12% constant currency growth at the midpoint, which is on our financial model of 12% ACV growth, including tuck-in M&A. We are updating our revenue outlook to a range of $2.234 billion to $2.284 billion, which is growth of 7.8% to 10.2% or 8.4% to 10.9% in constant currency. We are operationally increasing our full year revenue by $15 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $25 million of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $23 million of additional foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.34 to $8.75. Relative to our August guidance, our updated full year EPS contemplates $0.25 of operational improvement, which was offset by $0.21 of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China, and $0.13 of additional foreign exchange headwinds. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $705 million to $735 million and relative to our August guidance includes a $10 million increase from operational improvement, which was offset by $7 million of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $7 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Although we experienced an unexpected impact in Q3 from changes in export compliance, our underlying model remains strong. This is driven by robust market growth, a best-in-class portfolio, deep customer relationships and a highly recurring business model with strong operating leverage. Our current full year 2023 guidance midpoint implies a two-year unlevered operating cash flow CAGR of 14% since 2021. This reflects the strong top line momentum and operating leverage where unlevered operating cash flow growth outpaces ACV growth. Now let me turn to guidance for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $897.8 million to $942.8 million. Turning to the P&L, we expect Q4 revenue in the range of $769.2 million to $819.2 million. We expect Q4 operating margin in the range of 48.9% to 51.2% and EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.89. Given the robust renewal business in our fourth quarter, we are confident in achieving our Q4 guidance. Our core simulation market is strong and diversified with consistent demand from our customers as they encounter increasingly complex product development challenges. Despite the headwinds we expect to see from the impact of additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China, we have confidence in our long-term model. As a result, in February, we expect to initiate full year 2024 guidance with ACV of around 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A, which is consistent with our model. Within this outlook, we are absorbing the impact of the updated export restrictions and incremental processes related to certain prospects located in China, which will mute ANSYS' ACV and revenue growth in China in 2024. We continue to focus our efforts on areas of opportunity and innovation to ensure continued growth. As a result, we also reaffirm our long-term outlook from 2022 to 2025 of 12% constant currency ACV growth including tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flow. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q4 are contained in the prepared remarks document. ANSYS' business is highly resilient with a diverse and broad customer base, market-leading portfolio, deep customer relationships and recurring financial model. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your dedication and hard work in supporting our customers and delivering world-class innovation. We saw some complexity during the quarter, and we executed well in a challenging environment. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook while working alongside the best team in the industry. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Let's start with China. With respect to the enhanced processes that you referred to in the prepared remarks and the 10-Q, could you elaborate on what that means, what with ANSYS not doing perhaps efficiently internally to vet the customers? And would it be fair to say that the ANSYS products in question we're not solely EDA products, in other words this isn't just a product that we're going to Chinese semis, but other non-EDA products as well to perhaps other end customers in China, then my follow-up.\nAjei Gopal: Hey. Good morning, Jay. So let me take that. And so there's a \u2013 there's clearly a bit of a misunderstanding in your question. So let me just try to sort of lay this out so that you have more clarity on the context here. So as you know, in the context of the broader U.S. foreign policy shifts, the Department of Commerce is engaging both privately and publicly with companies to apply export controls to China of certain technologies. And of course, elite high-tech companies are facing new restrictions. And given the capabilities of ANSYS products and their broad applicability across industries and across use cases we have implemented an additional layer of vetting for prospects located in China to comply with the incremental requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce. So let me just sort of walk through how the quarter unfolded. So we were on track to delivering against our third quarter guidance commitments when the Commerce Department informed us of these additional restrictions as well as incremental approval processes on the sale of certain ANSYS' products to entities located in China. And so we immediately complied. We suspended processing orders from those affected prospects that were located in China pending the resolution of some ambiguities that were related to the process. And we work with the Commerce Department, but unfortunately, by the time we received clarity on the incremental vetting that was required above and beyond our existing compliance program, it was the last business day of Q3, and that made it too late to complete our vetting process within the quarter. Now moving forward, we have internally aligned our business operations to adjust to these new betting requirements and the result is an increase in the time that it takes us to process transactions with certain prospects that are located in China. But as I said in the call, despite these developments related to prospects in China, the ANSYS business overall is performing well. We delivered a strong quarter, marked by double-digit growth in ACV, and we continue to see robust and broad-based demand for our technologies and the products. And given the critical role that our solutions play in our customers' product development initiatives, and the strength of the underlying foundations of our global business, we're confident in our ability to execute against our short and our long-term objective.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. With respect to guidance for Q4 and the initial thoughts on next year, was the operational raise for Q4, both renewals business, in other words you're expecting some higher ACV in the renewals and new business, perhaps from new logos. And then for the 10% for next year, how are you thinking about the contribution from the new AIML enhanced products that you're beginning to deploy as per the schedule you gave back in July?\nNicole Anasenes: So Jay, maybe I'll just take the Q4 guidance question, and then we can add some more color on your last part of your question. So although we experienced an unexpected impact from changes in export compliance in China, the underlying model remains strong, as Ajei said. And as a testament to this year-to-date, we achieved 12% ACV growth in constant currency, which is of course on our model. Our business is very resilient. As you know, 80% of it comes from recurring sources. And as we look to Q4, the robust renewal business that we see in the fourth quarter gives us confidence in achieving our guidance. And maybe just to add an additional data point to add some color as to where we stand as of October. As of the end of October we have just under half the business in our Q4 outlook already committed, so despite the disruption from changes required for export or compliance in China, we're continuing to see the operational momentum in the rest of our business. That's what gave us the confidence in raising the full year ACV by $11 million compared to the August guidance, which, of course, was offset by the $25 million of impact from additional restrictions and processes in our business in China and of course, the foreign exchange impact of $28 million. But outside of this impact, we continue to see momentum across the business, and we haven't seen any notable changes in customer activity.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Vruwink from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I also want to start on the 10% growth outlook for 2024. I'm wondering how did you go about ring-fencing the potential risk from China export controls into next year. Is it just kind of run rating the 2023 experience? Or are you layering on incremental assumptions? And then I was hoping you could maybe be a bit more explicit on just total ACV exposure from China and then a sense of maybe how much business has assumed not to transact within the 2024 initial outlook?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. Happy to do that. So why don't I kind of take you through \u2013 why don't I take you through the kind of the Q3 impact, how we \u2013 kind of how that we think that impacts 2023 and what the flow-through impact to 2024 in the long-term will be to kind of try to holistically answer some of your questions. But just too kind of give some overall context going into that in terms of your question around China exposure overall. Our business is broad and diverse, and as you know, we're diversified across many industries and geographies and customer types. And our business in China is around 5% of ACV, both on a trailing 12-month basis and full year 2022. So it's a relatively a smaller portion of the portfolio. Now in the third quarter, again, our ability to deliver that double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter despite the disruptions we saw is really a testament to the resilience of our business model, which as we talk about 2024 is what gives us the confidence in our outlook. Now the third quarter results were impacted by those incremental vetting processes and restrictions to certain prospects in China that created about a $20 million headwind to ACV and revenue, which was not contemplated in our third quarter guidance. But without this impact, we would have landed near the high-end of our third quarter guidance range on ACV and above the high end of our revenue guidance. Now we expect that the majority of the $20 million to be a timing shift with a small portion of being lost in business. So as you extend into our 2023 outlook \u2013 embedded in the 2023 outlook, it does reflect that incremental operational performance and the momentum that we've seen in the business overall, which is of course, offset by the impact from the export compliance changes, but for the full year in 2023, we expect the impact from incremental export restrictions in the vetting processes in China to have a $25 million impact on ACV and revenue, and we believe just to kind of give a rough sizing, about a third of that is loss of business and two-thirds of that would be an expected timing shift from the elongated transaction cycle. So the effect of this will mute 2023 growth in China. Now as we look to the future, the incremental export restrictions and vetting processes, we also believe will mute ANSYS' ACV and revenue growth in China in 2024 and we expect that impact just \u2013 since you asked about sizing, we expect it to be about $10 million to $30 million on both ACV and revenue in the full year in 2024. And as the majority of that headwind will be loss of business, we would expect the 2024 cash impact to be similar in that range as well. Now despite these headwinds, in February, we still expect to initiate full year 2024 guidance on our model with ACV around 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A. And really, the double-digit performance we saw year-to-date, the strong pipeline and momentum in our business, all of these really give us the confidence not only in our 2024 outlook, but in our ability to achieve our long-term outlook which, of course, was a 12% constant currency ACV growth, including tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flows from 2022 to 2025.\nAjei Gopal: And if I could just jump in a little bit, just to talk \u2013 to give you some color about the broader environment that we're working with. I have an opportunity as part of my job to talk to customers around the world, to talk to channel partners around the world. And the demand for our products and our services continues to be as strong as ever or stronger. And just given the nature of our technology, we feel very confident in our ability to solve some of our customers' most challenging problems. So we feel very good about our business. Obviously, Nicole walked through the impact of the China additional approval processes that we just went through.\nJoe Vruwink: And just on that point, Ajei, and that was great, Nicole. Thank you. Organic growth and I'll say ex-China, it was better than your formal framework in 2022; it's been better year-to-date. I guess, how do you think about the recent drivers of outperformance relative to your midterm plan and whether those maybe factor positively in 2024?\nAjei Gopal: Well, I think one of the key things that we've been doing very clearly and explicitly in our strategy is to be focusing on some important technologies that continue to improve our product capabilities and as well as being very explicit about going after some of these high growth or next-generation use cases like electrification. So if you look at the nature of our technology, we can support those use cases. We're in a position to support our customers as they're thinking about these next-generation use cases. And that's \u2013 those are the investments that we've been making in our product portfolio. And I talked about \u2013 last time I talked about these five broad areas that we're investing in, the numerics of our business, HPC capabilities, AI capabilities of course, cloud as well as digital engineering. And all of those are broad techniques that we use across our portfolio and advantage our portfolio. So the investments that we're making are paying off as we support our customers.\nJoe Vruwink: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJason Celino: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple on the China export restrictions. Ajei, I hear you on the news, optically, I think we're a little surprised because it appears others may not be affected. Do you know if other companies were approached as well?\nAjei Gopal: So obviously, we don't know \u2013 we don't know who else has been approached privately because these conversations are taking place between the Commerce Department both privately as well as publicly. So I can't really comment on who else has been approached. But the reality, as I said before is you're seeing out there elite high-tech companies facing these new restrictions. And I would imagine that anyone who has products like ANSYS, which are highly capable products, which are broad-based and applicable across industries and across use cases might have similar discussions. But obviously, I'm not in a position to comment about those. I don't know.\nJason Celino: Okay. And then just a quick one for Nicole, on the types of revenue that was affected, was it more perpetual or lease? Sorry, just a modeling that question.\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. It was a combination of both. So as you know, our business model has been shifting to subscription lease over the long-term. And this year in particular, you've seen just generally outside of this quarter a sponsorship to lease [ph]. And so there was a mix of both that were impacted in the quarter\nKelsey DeBriyn: Operator we can take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Wong of Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.\nKen Wong: Great. thanks for taking y question. Maybe first off for you, Ajei, maybe change gears a little bit. Just wanted to ask about the auto industry, there has been some concern that maybe with the strike that that could have caused some deal slippage or anything like that. Just wondering if you saw any erosion in your auto business at all?\nAjei Gopal: Hey, thanks for the question, Ken. So with auto, the broad-based \u2013 and I've said this multiple times, and I'll say it again, I mean, we're tied to the overall R&D cycle. And the broad-based conversations that are taking place with our automotive customers are around electrification around autonomy and those continue \u2013 those conversations and those design imperatives continue unabated as far as our customers are concerned. So that's really driving our business. And then, of course, we \u2013 as I mentioned in the script, we also have the traditional business crash testing, external airflow, things like that, which we've been doing for a number of years. So all of that continues, it's really design-driven, not manufacturing-driven. The other important thing to consider and realize is that car companies and automotive companies, frankly, all industries everyone is looking at reducing cycle time. And so as you start to reduce cycle time, what's really happening is many of our customers are recognizing that using digital techniques such as simulation allows them to achieve that reduction in cycle time. It allows them to effectively shift left. And that shift left reduces the time that it takes to bring innovation to market faster. And in a highly competitive world like automotive, for example, where you have multiple new entrances coming in as well, that design cycle is of paramount importance. And that\u2019s really where we are seeing the opportunity. And that\u2019s reflected in the conversations we\u2019re having with our customers.\nKen Wong: Got it. And then, Nicole, just because I don\u2019t want to be excluded from the China Party, it sounds like what you guys have baked into the expectations is that these deals do come back into the pipeline. As we think about 2024, is it assumed that the 2023 deals fall into 2024, or should we assume that both 2023, 2024 don\u2019t return until fiscal 2025, in terms of how you guys are embedding into your outlook?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So my reference to the 2023 impact of about two-thirds timing shift and one-third loss of business translates to 2024 as well, right. So the nature of this process is really just kind of an extension of that sales cycle, which in the current outlook we\u2019re seeing, is kind of a shift of that business, kind of to the right, if you will. But the $10 million to $30 million of headwind that we\u2019re expecting to see next year related to this specifically, is our best estimate as to what would be the net loss in 2024.\nKen Wong: Okay, perfect. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteven Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nSteven Tusa: Can you just talk about what kind of is this a customer type issue in China or is it more general than that?\nAjei Gopal: Well, this issue affects prospects who are located in China. So that\u2019s the nature of the conversation. It\u2019s the sale of prospects who are located in China and it\u2019s to people who are performing things like R&D and some other activities in China. So it\u2019s specifically restricted to those kinds of customers or prospects.\nSteven Tusa: I guess though, on your ACV, it looked like electronics was kind of weaker than expected. We assume that it was kind of focused in that piece of the pie.\nNicole Anasenes: Sorry, are you talking about the industrial \u2013 the industry mix chart? I just want to make sure exactly what you are referring to.\nSteven Tusa: Exactly.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So.\nSteven Tusa: What type of industry is what I\u2019m like trying to just wrap my head around here a little bit.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, I would say so it is the industry \u2013 that the processes \u2013 the incremental vetting processes apply to essentially prospects in China that are regardless of industry, right. And so there\u2019s additional restrictions that may be specific, but the incremental processes are agnostic across industry. The dynamics that you\u2019re referring to just to kind of answer that particular question. So when you look at those industry mix charts, those that the relative \u2013 those kind of sizings of representation by industry are all relative. So really relative growth is more of what\u2019s driving the mix shift in those countries. And so all of our largest industries have grown. Given \u2013 but given the strong 12 months performance in automotive, that kind of drove the overall mix shift. So it was really about relative strength in automotive than any particular weakness in any other place.\nSteven Tusa: Right. That makes sense. And is this like ANSYS specific or is it something that they kind of cast a bit wider of a net? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot going on out there between our two countries. Rockwell had some issue, I believe. Is this like \u2013 is this really ANSYS specific?\nAjei Gopal: Again, I can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know who the commerce department is engaged with because some of these conversations are private and some of these are public. So we don\u2019t really know who they\u2019re engaged with. But as I said, we can see what\u2019s in front of us. And I believe it just has to do with the fact that our products are very capable and are broadly applicable across industries and use cases.\nSteven Tusa: Right. Sorry, one really quick last one.\nAjei Gopal: And specifically to follow on that point, so the incremental vetting that we\u2019re putting in place is really that it\u2019s an incremental vetting process that just adds a certain amount of latency to the approval process. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening in this context. And obviously, we\u2019re just taking what we had before, which was industry standard vetting, and we\u2019ve added some an additional layer above that.\nSteven Tusa: Right. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s 1% of ACV or whatever you want to call it right now, as opposed to it being like across the board, 5% of ACV, which would be a real impairment in the ability to kind of do business over in China, right?\nNicole Anasenes: Correct.\nAjei Gopal: Yes.\nSteven Tusa: Yes. Okay. All right. Thanks for all the details, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Borg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMike Richards: Hi, everyone. This is Mike Richards on for Adam Borg. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the AI innovations announced last week between SimAI and AI and AI plus, and then even ANSYS GPT, maybe you guys could discuss how you guys are thinking about planning on pricing these? And what kind of pricing uplift that\u2019ll drive in the long term? Thanks.\nAjei Gopal: So let me sort of just since you asked the question, let me sort of explain what those are. And \u2013 but to get to your question about pricing, some of this is still being worked out in terms of how we would \u2013 exactly what we would price them. But I can give you some philosophy as we go through this. So obviously, AIML is one of our critical pillars that we are focused on across our portfolio. In Q2, we released a beta version of our support technology called ANSYSGPT that\u2019s based on GPT-4. And that\u2019s a virtual multilingual support tool that can answer customers technical questions by retrieving and summarizing ANSYS information. And we believe that will provide ANSYS to the most frequently asked questions that customers have in a matter of seconds. And obviously, it\u2019s going to be available 24/7. So that\u2019s the first area. The second thing that we announced last week is this new generation of products called the AI plus products. And those are building on the AI capabilities that we have available today. So these are new products that will be packaged and priced accordingly. And these new AI plus products include things like ANSYS Granta, AI plus, optiSLang AI plus. And these new products will incorporate and extend some of the AI features that we already have within these products. The SimAI technology that we talked about, this is a brand new offering that is a cloud. It\u2019s a cloud native AI platform that will augment our 3D physics simulation capabilities. And it\u2019s essentially one where our customers will be able to do things like design analysis optimization by using simulation results to train an AI model to predict new design configurations using deep learning techniques. And so this can predict performance across design changes, geometry changes, and so forth. It\u2019s really a physics neutral technology. It applies across industry segments. And we can leverage simulation data whether it originates from ANSYS or from anyone else for that matter. So this is a \u2013 this is again, a new product that will be priced accordingly. The actual pricing has not been announced yet.\nMike Richards: Thank you.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow up on the international performance. Looked like Germany in particular was a bit weaker. It sounds like you are seeing pretty resilient trends in autos. But wasn\u2019t sure if that was a tougher compare or just anything to call out in Europe.\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So, as just one reminder on the overall revenue results that you see in the results, we saw a lot of impact from the 606 accounting change. And so I am going to \u2013 I\u2019ll answer to your question specifically related to that. But also kind of try to give some broader context around ACV because as you recall, this quarter ACV and revenue are highly disconnected. And your Germany answer or your Germany question is actually a prime example of the lease accounting dynamics that played out creating that year-over-year headwind. So, just to use that as an example, in Q3 2022, Germany saw exceptionally robust revenue growth. The revenue growth in Germany was 102% at constant currency. Now, the growth last year was a function of both strong ACV growth, but also the underlying accounting associated with the nature of the mix of transactions in that quarter. And so I think that just gives you kind of a microcosm in Germany being a relatively larger portion of Europe, that was a dynamic that affected overall revenue growth. But when you zoom out and although we don\u2019t give \u2013 we don\u2019t typically provide ACV by geography, but EMEA had good growth on ACV in Q3 and \u2013 which was really reflective of the region\u2019s operational stability. And just to give some kind of color to the dynamics and the underlying industry performance there, high-tech, aerospace and defense, industrial equipment industries all were strong in EMEA. The quarter was highlighted by sales to a global semiconductor manufacturer and supplier. We also saw a multi-year deal with a research and development company in the A&D industry. They provided more users within its growing simulation team to access our solutions. And then we also had a multi-year deal with the European pump manufacturer that added more global users, more products, more physics, and HPC capacity. So more computation. So the revenue results are really emblematic of the dynamics that we talked about and expected in August. But the underlying ACV performance in the region is quite strong.\nTyler Radke: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just to follow up on the long-term\u2026\nAjei Gopal: Yes. And just to\u2026\nTyler Radke: Yes.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. Just to add to what Nicole was saying, I mean, I think that we would \u2013 when we talk about \u2013 when I talk about my own experiences with customers, sort of anecdotally as I said before, I have an opportunity to talk to customers and channel partners. And we\u2019re really seeing strength, as Nicole said, across multiple industries and across also the different market segments. And in particular, when I talk to channel partners who focus more at the lower end, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity. And obviously, at our enterprise customers, where we directly engage, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity. So there\u2019s a lot of design work and R&D efforts that are taking place across these industries across the world. And we believe \u2013 and we\u2019re excited about our ability to support our customers in those spaces.\nTyler Radke: That\u2019s helpful. And\u2026\nNicole Anasenes: Tyler, you had a follow-up question.\nTyler Radke: Yes, I did. I did. So just as I think about the 2024 comments and your helpful breakout of the China impacts in terms of I think, two thirds being just delayed business, should we think about that all happening in 2024? And then as I think about your reiteration of your long-term targets, I guess if you could just kind of unpack the puts and takes and do you assume to kind of have the China business normalize and get that full two thirds through the long-term targets? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that when you look underneath, so, as we said, we expect to initiate in 2024 \u2013 in February, in 2024 on the model. So 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A. Now, the impact of what we\u2019re estimating to be dropout that we are kind of overcoming in that underlying model is the $10 million to $30 million of ACV in revenue. Now, throughout the year, there\u2019s some shift in timing from this year to next year and next year to the year after. But kind of that just is like the permanent shift that we would expect underneath the covers. But in terms of the kind of \u2013 the pure headwind, which is that we\u2019d be wrapping on coming out of 2024, it would be that $10 million to $30 million.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Thank you.\nKelsey DeBriyn: That\u2019s all the time we have today. I will turn it over to Ajei for some closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: Thank you, Kelsey. With our market leading product portfolio and strong pipeline, ANSYS is well positioned to meet our commitments. I want to thank my colleagues around the world for their continued dedication to ANSYS. I want to thank our channel partners, and I want to thank, of course, our global customer base. Thank you your time today, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. In Q3, ANSYS was on track to deliver against our third quarter guidance commitments when we were notified by the U.S. Department of Commerce of additional restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities, as well as incremental approval processes and export restrictions on the sale of some ANSYS products and services to entities located in China. These incremental approval processes take the form of additional vetting of prospects located in China. They introduce delays in transacting certain orders for prospects in China, resulting in the potential loss or deferral of some business that was scheduled to be closed in Q3. As a result, we came in below our expectations in both ACV and revenue for the quarter. Despite these developments, ANSYS delivered a strong quarter marked by double-digit growth in ACV. These updated export restrictions and incremental processes will mute ANSYS\u2019 growth in China in 2023 and 2024, after which we expect our business in China to return to steady state growth. Nicole will give the specifics in a few minutes. It is important to remember that China represents only a small portion of our overall business. Given the strength of our business worldwide, I\u2019m confident in our ability to execute on our short and long-term objectives. Looking back on Q3, high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation were our top contributing industries. We saw strength in Q3 for ACV across all customer types, and our geographical performance was as expected with the exception of China as I already mentioned. Our largest contract in the quarter was a three-year eight-figure agreement with the North American aerospace and defense company that has used our solutions for years. The new agreement with this customer increases the number of users of ANSYS technology. Thanks in part to ANSYS technology, the customer has secured a key contract with the U.S. government. On our calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability initiatives as well as in the development of next generation semiconductors and how ANSYS simulation is driving fundamental changes in the commercial aerospace industry. A similar simulation power transformation is taking place in the automotive industry, which is where I\u2019d like to focus today\u2019s discussion. As you were aware, automotive and ground transportation is our third largest industry, and ANSYS is already working with over 50 of the top transportation OEMs around the world and 93 of the top 100 global automotive suppliers. Yet with all the innovation taking place within the sector, there is still significant room for ANSYS to grow through more users, more products, and more computations. ANSYS simulation is helping to usher in a new era of mobility through key \u2013 to three key areas, electrification, autonomy and driver assistance and software defined vehicles. And of course, we\u2019re also driving continued innovation in vehicle development. I\u2019ll walk through each with some pertinent examples. The first area of profound change in the industry is around electrification. From battery management systems to fuel cells to integrated electrified powertrain systems, ANSYS solutions are enabling rapid electric vehicle innovation from the components to the system levels. For example, our multiphysics battery simulation solutions provide interdisciplinary expertise at different scales. ANSYS\u2019 solutions for powertrain electrification provide a complete development flow from the system level to the software level, including system simulation, model-based development and functional safety analysis. Using ANSYS, customers have reduced battery project costs by up to 30% and design cycle times by up to 50% [ph]. Porsche Motorsports turns to ANSYS simulation to speed up development time for its electric race car. With ANSYS, the engineers from the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E Team optimize their cars inverter and e-motor efficiency and then test it on a virtual racetrack. Simulation has proved to be pivotal for managing the battery\u2019s temperature and maximizing the cost performance within these demanding driving conditions. The next area I\u2019d like to discuss is autonomy and driver assistance systems. While the road to truly autonomous vehicles may be a long one, the simulation driven advances required to bring this technology to market are leading to safer driving experiences today. Using ANSYS, customers are improving advanced driver assistance systems, also known as ADAS. For example, sensors play a critical role in providing human drivers as well as autonomous systems, the data they need to make intelligent and safe decisions. ANSYS solutions for lidar, radar, and cameras enable engineers to improve sensor performance to determine optimal vehicle integration configurations and to examine their behavior across a range of operational scenarios. ANSYS customer continental is using ANSYS simulation for optical integration analysis and corner case studies that are integral to the development and validation of new sensors and computer vision algorithms. ANSYS simulation is helping continental/development time and physical testing, while reducing costs and freeing up engineering resources. The next area I would like to discuss is the development of software-defined vehicles. These automobiles have features that are primarily enabled through software and can be remotely upgraded over the cars\u2019 lifetime. The market for software-defined vehicles is expected to grow from about $35 billion today to over $200 billion early in the next decade. Thanks to software-driven features for safety, infotainment and efficiency. ANSYS solutions enable these feature-rich functions through model-based, certified embedded software and code generation, electronics reliability and connectivity systems. These advances enable engineers to meet industry safety requirements faster than manual approaches and at lower costs. Longtime ANSYS customer ZF Group is using our solutions to reduce the complexity of analysis for embedded systems. These embedded systems must be capable of operating reliably and safely on a challenging environmental conditions. In the past, ZF used different tools for failure modes and effects analysis and for fault tree analysis. By standardizing on ANSYS, the company reports saving hundreds of hours on each of the many analysis projects they run. The final area I would like to mention is in vehicle development. This is a space in which ANSYS has a long history as we play a key role in such critical areas as aerodynamics, lighting, crash safety analysis, and material management for sustainability initiatives. For example, ANSYS LS-DYNA simulates crash scenarios and accurately predicts the impact on the vehicle as well as the driver and passengers. Thanks to human body models. On materials intelligence solutions enable vehicle lightweighting efforts while assessing the environmental impact of materials throughout their lifecycle. With the growth of lighting technologies and headlamps and tail lamps, ANSYS lighting solutions have reduced the need for prototypes. One of our key contracts in the quarter was with a global automotive OEM based in Europe that has standardized on ANSYS for virtual crash testing and impact analysis replacing a competitive product. The company is leveraging ANSYS simulations to help meet its goal of reducing engineering lead time by 30% and cutting the cost of physical testing by 50%. In Q3, we also signed a contract with the leading provider of automotive seeding products. This longtime customer has expanded its use of ANSYS multiphysics solutions from explicit dynamics, electromagnetics and functional safety to include mechanical, fluids and high performance computing. This expanded ANSYS footprint benefits a number of projects. For example, enabling the company to simulate the fan noise from its ventilated seats. With ANSYS technology, this automotive leader has dramatically cut development costs, reduced simulation time from days to hours, and enabled the company to respond faster and more accurately to customer requests for quotes. I\u2019d also like to mention a different kind of customer win. I\u2019m excited to congratulate ANSYS customer Oracle Red Bull Racing on an amazing season, which culminated in capturing the 2023 Formula 1 World Constructors\u2019 and World Drivers\u2019 Championships. Using ANSYS solutions, the team simulated airflow interactions with differing shapes of the car\u2019s surface, while also analyzing engine cooling intakes. As a result, the team drove away with the championship. Moving beyond the automotive industry, I\u2019m excited to announce that we have enrolled our 2000th companies as a member of the ANSYS Startup Program. As I have said in the past, while members of our Startup Program represent a small piece of our overall business, they\u2019re amongst the most innovative users of our products. And with the program\u2019s strong graduation rates more and more expand their use of ANSYS technology and become larger ANSYS customers. I\u2019m also proud that ANSYS has received a number of awards this quarter related to employee engagement and satisfaction from organizations such as Newsweek, Best Workplaces in Europe in U.S. News and World Report. These recognitions are a testament to our supportive, diverse, and inclusive culture, as well as the quality of our team around the world. In summary, Q3 was marked by an external challenge that impacted our ability to process certain transactions. Our global business remains strong and the demand for ANSYS technology is robust. That\u2019s because companies across industries rely on ANSYS to solve the most challenging problems that they\u2019re facing. These global organizations understand that ANSYS\u2019 expertise and deep and broad portfolio of multiphysics solutions can help them solve their key product and business challenges. That combined with our best-in-class product portfolio, our deep customer relationships and the ongoing strength of our pipeline give me confidence in our ability to meet our commitments. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Hey. Good morning, Jay. So let me take that. And so there's a \u2013 there's clearly a bit of a misunderstanding in your question. So let me just try to sort of lay this out so that you have more clarity on the context here. So as you know, in the context of the broader U.S. foreign policy shifts, the Department of Commerce is engaging both privately and publicly with companies to apply export controls to China of certain technologies. And of course, elite high-tech companies are facing new restrictions. And given the capabilities of ANSYS products and their broad applicability across industries and across use cases we have implemented an additional layer of vetting for prospects located in China to comply with the incremental requirements from the U.S. Department of Commerce. So let me just sort of walk through how the quarter unfolded. So we were on track to delivering against our third quarter guidance commitments when the Commerce Department informed us of these additional restrictions as well as incremental approval processes on the sale of certain ANSYS' products to entities located in China. And so we immediately complied. We suspended processing orders from those affected prospects that were located in China pending the resolution of some ambiguities that were related to the process. And we work with the Commerce Department, but unfortunately, by the time we received clarity on the incremental vetting that was required above and beyond our existing compliance program, it was the last business day of Q3, and that made it too late to complete our vetting process within the quarter. Now moving forward, we have internally aligned our business operations to adjust to these new betting requirements and the result is an increase in the time that it takes us to process transactions with certain prospects that are located in China. But as I said in the call, despite these developments related to prospects in China, the ANSYS business overall is performing well. We delivered a strong quarter, marked by double-digit growth in ACV, and we continue to see robust and broad-based demand for our technologies and the products. And given the critical role that our solutions play in our customers' product development initiatives, and the strength of the underlying foundations of our global business, we're confident in our ability to execute against our short and our long-term objective. And if I could just jump in a little bit, just to talk \u2013 to give you some color about the broader environment that we're working with. I have an opportunity as part of my job to talk to customers around the world, to talk to channel partners around the world. And the demand for our products and our services continues to be as strong as ever or stronger. And just given the nature of our technology, we feel very confident in our ability to solve some of our customers' most challenging problems. So we feel very good about our business. Obviously, Nicole walked through the impact of the China additional approval processes that we just went through. Well, I think one of the key things that we've been doing very clearly and explicitly in our strategy is to be focusing on some important technologies that continue to improve our product capabilities and as well as being very explicit about going after some of these high growth or next-generation use cases like electrification. So if you look at the nature of our technology, we can support those use cases. We're in a position to support our customers as they're thinking about these next-generation use cases. And that's \u2013 those are the investments that we've been making in our product portfolio. And I talked about \u2013 last time I talked about these five broad areas that we're investing in, the numerics of our business, HPC capabilities, AI capabilities of course, cloud as well as digital engineering. And all of those are broad techniques that we use across our portfolio and advantage our portfolio. So the investments that we're making are paying off as we support our customers. So obviously, we don't know \u2013 we don't know who else has been approached privately because these conversations are taking place between the Commerce Department both privately as well as publicly. So I can't really comment on who else has been approached. But the reality, as I said before is you're seeing out there elite high-tech companies facing these new restrictions. And I would imagine that anyone who has products like ANSYS, which are highly capable products, which are broad-based and applicable across industries and across use cases might have similar discussions. But obviously, I'm not in a position to comment about those. I don't know. Hey, thanks for the question, Ken. So with auto, the broad-based \u2013 and I've said this multiple times, and I'll say it again, I mean, we're tied to the overall R&D cycle. And the broad-based conversations that are taking place with our automotive customers are around electrification around autonomy and those continue \u2013 those conversations and those design imperatives continue unabated as far as our customers are concerned. So that's really driving our business. And then, of course, we \u2013 as I mentioned in the script, we also have the traditional business crash testing, external airflow, things like that, which we've been doing for a number of years. So all of that continues, it's really design-driven, not manufacturing-driven. The other important thing to consider and realize is that car companies and automotive companies, frankly, all industries everyone is looking at reducing cycle time. And so as you start to reduce cycle time, what's really happening is many of our customers are recognizing that using digital techniques such as simulation allows them to achieve that reduction in cycle time. It allows them to effectively shift left. And that shift left reduces the time that it takes to bring innovation to market faster. And in a highly competitive world like automotive, for example, where you have multiple new entrances coming in as well, that design cycle is of paramount importance. And that\u2019s really where we are seeing the opportunity. And that\u2019s reflected in the conversations we\u2019re having with our customers. Well, this issue affects prospects who are located in China. So that\u2019s the nature of the conversation. It\u2019s the sale of prospects who are located in China and it\u2019s to people who are performing things like R&D and some other activities in China. So it\u2019s specifically restricted to those kinds of customers or prospects. Again, I can\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know who the commerce department is engaged with because some of these conversations are private and some of these are public. So we don\u2019t really know who they\u2019re engaged with. But as I said, we can see what\u2019s in front of us. And I believe it just has to do with the fact that our products are very capable and are broadly applicable across industries and use cases. And specifically to follow on that point, so the incremental vetting that we\u2019re putting in place is really that it\u2019s an incremental vetting process that just adds a certain amount of latency to the approval process. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening in this context. And obviously, we\u2019re just taking what we had before, which was industry standard vetting, and we\u2019ve added some an additional layer above that. Yes. So let me sort of just since you asked the question, let me sort of explain what those are. And \u2013 but to get to your question about pricing, some of this is still being worked out in terms of how we would \u2013 exactly what we would price them. But I can give you some philosophy as we go through this. So obviously, AIML is one of our critical pillars that we are focused on across our portfolio. In Q2, we released a beta version of our support technology called ANSYSGPT that\u2019s based on GPT-4. And that\u2019s a virtual multilingual support tool that can answer customers technical questions by retrieving and summarizing ANSYS information. And we believe that will provide ANSYS to the most frequently asked questions that customers have in a matter of seconds. And obviously, it\u2019s going to be available 24/7. So that\u2019s the first area. The second thing that we announced last week is this new generation of products called the AI plus products. And those are building on the AI capabilities that we have available today. So these are new products that will be packaged and priced accordingly. And these new AI plus products include things like ANSYS Granta, AI plus, optiSLang AI plus. And these new products will incorporate and extend some of the AI features that we already have within these products. The SimAI technology that we talked about, this is a brand new offering that is a cloud. It\u2019s a cloud native AI platform that will augment our 3D physics simulation capabilities. And it\u2019s essentially one where our customers will be able to do things like design analysis optimization by using simulation results to train an AI model to predict new design configurations using deep learning techniques. And so this can predict performance across design changes, geometry changes, and so forth. It\u2019s really a physics neutral technology. It applies across industry segments. And we can leverage simulation data whether it originates from ANSYS or from anyone else for that matter. So this is a \u2013 this is again, a new product that will be priced accordingly. The actual pricing has not been announced yet. Yes. And just to\u2026 Yes. Just to add to what Nicole was saying, I mean, I think that we would \u2013 when we talk about \u2013 when I talk about my own experiences with customers, sort of anecdotally as I said before, I have an opportunity to talk to customers and channel partners. And we\u2019re really seeing strength, as Nicole said, across multiple industries and across also the different market segments. And in particular, when I talk to channel partners who focus more at the lower end, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity. And obviously, at our enterprise customers, where we directly engage, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity. So there\u2019s a lot of design work and R&D efforts that are taking place across these industries across the world. And we believe \u2013 and we\u2019re excited about our ability to support our customers in those spaces. Thank you, Kelsey. With our market leading product portfolio and strong pipeline, ANSYS is well positioned to meet our commitments. I want to thank my colleagues around the world for their continued dedication to ANSYS. I want to thank our channel partners, and I want to thank, of course, our global customer base. Thank you your time today, and have a great day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our third quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q4 and full year 2023. Our ability to deliver double-digit ACV constant currency growth in Q3 despite the disruption from the changes required for export compliance in China is a testament to the resilience of our business model. Our highly recurring business model, significant base of renewals, market-leading simulation portfolio and deep customer relationships, create a strong financial foundation and contribute to unwavering demand for our product. As a result, we are raising our full year ACV and revenue guidance for operational momentum in the business. This momentum is offset by impacts of incremental approval processes and export restrictions in China and foreign exchange headwinds. I'll provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now let me discuss some of our Q3 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV we delivered $457.5 million in Q3, which grew 12% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency. Our growth was broad-based across customer types, geographic regions and most industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 13% or 16% in constant currency on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 83% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. This annuity creates resiliency and durability in our business model. It provides a robust foundation for near and long-term growth, which enables us to navigate the impact of business disruptions that can occur from time-to-time, like the impact of the changes to export compliance that we saw in Q3. Q3 total revenue was $458.8 million and was down 3% or down 4% in constant currency, primarily due to ASC 606 dynamics given the quarterly mix of license types that generate upfront revenue recognition, which we previously discussed on our August earnings call and detailed in our Q2 prepared remarks document. During the third quarter, both ACV and revenue were below expectations. As incremental approval processes and export restrictions on certain prospects in China created a $20 million headwind. When we set our guidance range, we guide based on the pipeline and book of business that we see in front of us. During the third quarter, we saw an impact on the contracts we expected to sign due to incremental approval processes and export restrictions that were not contemplated in our Q3 guidance provided in August. As a result, our Q3 ACV and revenue results were below our guidance. Without this impact, we would have landed near the high end of our third quarter guidance on ACV and above the high end of our revenue guidance. We have a very strong track record of achieving our guidance and it was unfortunate that we were not able to achieve our guidance for ACV and revenue this quarter. We continue to have a broad and diverse business model and a strong financial foundation with significant recurring ACV. We remain optimistic on our future growth. Despite the disruption in Q3, our year-to-date ACV performance was robust with ACV growing double-digit in constant currency at 12% and broad-based growth across geographies and customer types. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.2 billion, which grew 9% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid third quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 34.1%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by lower expenses and the timing of some investments. The result was third quarter EPS of $1.41, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from lower expenses and the timing of some investments. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2023. Our unlevered operating cash flow in the third quarter totaled $170.6 million and was in line with expectations and continues to be supported by strong cash collections. We ended the quarter with $640 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. Looking to the remainder of the year, the business continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We are updating our full year ACV outlook to a range of $2.243 billion to $2.288 billion which represents growth of 10.4% to 12.6% or 11% to 13.3% in constant currency. We continue to see our ACV growth driven by our broad-based customer demand for our product. And as a result, we are operationally increasing our full year ACV by $11 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $25 million of the impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $28 million of additional foreign exchange headwinds. This $25 million China export restriction and process headwind will mute ANSYS' growth in China in 2023, and includes some timing and loss of business impact. Despite the impact from China, our ACV growth outlook for the full year is 12% constant currency growth at the midpoint, which is on our financial model of 12% ACV growth, including tuck-in M&A. We are updating our revenue outlook to a range of $2.234 billion to $2.284 billion, which is growth of 7.8% to 10.2% or 8.4% to 10.9% in constant currency. We are operationally increasing our full year revenue by $15 million relative to our August guidance. This momentum was offset by $25 million of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $23 million of additional foreign exchange headwinds. We expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.34 to $8.75. Relative to our August guidance, our updated full year EPS contemplates $0.25 of operational improvement, which was offset by $0.21 of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China, and $0.13 of additional foreign exchange headwinds. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $705 million to $735 million and relative to our August guidance includes a $10 million increase from operational improvement, which was offset by $7 million of impact from additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China and $7 million of additional foreign exchange headwind. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Although we experienced an unexpected impact in Q3 from changes in export compliance, our underlying model remains strong. This is driven by robust market growth, a best-in-class portfolio, deep customer relationships and a highly recurring business model with strong operating leverage. Our current full year 2023 guidance midpoint implies a two-year unlevered operating cash flow CAGR of 14% since 2021. This reflects the strong top line momentum and operating leverage where unlevered operating cash flow growth outpaces ACV growth. Now let me turn to guidance for Q4. For the fourth quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $897.8 million to $942.8 million. Turning to the P&L, we expect Q4 revenue in the range of $769.2 million to $819.2 million. We expect Q4 operating margin in the range of 48.9% to 51.2% and EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.89. Given the robust renewal business in our fourth quarter, we are confident in achieving our Q4 guidance. Our core simulation market is strong and diversified with consistent demand from our customers as they encounter increasingly complex product development challenges. Despite the headwinds we expect to see from the impact of additional export restrictions and approval processes for certain prospects in China, we have confidence in our long-term model. As a result, in February, we expect to initiate full year 2024 guidance with ACV of around 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A, which is consistent with our model. Within this outlook, we are absorbing the impact of the updated export restrictions and incremental processes related to certain prospects located in China, which will mute ANSYS' ACV and revenue growth in China in 2024. We continue to focus our efforts on areas of opportunity and innovation to ensure continued growth. As a result, we also reaffirm our long-term outlook from 2022 to 2025 of 12% constant currency ACV growth including tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flow. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q4 are contained in the prepared remarks document. ANSYS' business is highly resilient with a diverse and broad customer base, market-leading portfolio, deep customer relationships and recurring financial model. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your dedication and hard work in supporting our customers and delivering world-class innovation. We saw some complexity during the quarter, and we executed well in a challenging environment. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook while working alongside the best team in the industry. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. So Jay, maybe I'll just take the Q4 guidance question, and then we can add some more color on your last part of your question. So although we experienced an unexpected impact from changes in export compliance in China, the underlying model remains strong, as Ajei said. And as a testament to this year-to-date, we achieved 12% ACV growth in constant currency, which is of course on our model. Our business is very resilient. As you know, 80% of it comes from recurring sources. And as we look to Q4, the robust renewal business that we see in the fourth quarter gives us confidence in achieving our guidance. And maybe just to add an additional data point to add some color as to where we stand as of October. As of the end of October we have just under half the business in our Q4 outlook already committed, so despite the disruption from changes required for export or compliance in China, we're continuing to see the operational momentum in the rest of our business. That's what gave us the confidence in raising the full year ACV by $11 million compared to the August guidance, which, of course, was offset by the $25 million of impact from additional restrictions and processes in our business in China and of course, the foreign exchange impact of $28 million. But outside of this impact, we continue to see momentum across the business, and we haven't seen any notable changes in customer activity. Sure. Happy to do that. So why don't I kind of take you through \u2013 why don't I take you through the kind of the Q3 impact, how we \u2013 kind of how that we think that impacts 2023 and what the flow-through impact to 2024 in the long-term will be to kind of try to holistically answer some of your questions. But just too kind of give some overall context going into that in terms of your question around China exposure overall. Our business is broad and diverse, and as you know, we're diversified across many industries and geographies and customer types. And our business in China is around 5% of ACV, both on a trailing 12-month basis and full year 2022. So it's a relatively a smaller portion of the portfolio. Now in the third quarter, again, our ability to deliver that double-digit constant currency growth in the quarter despite the disruptions we saw is really a testament to the resilience of our business model, which as we talk about 2024 is what gives us the confidence in our outlook. Now the third quarter results were impacted by those incremental vetting processes and restrictions to certain prospects in China that created about a $20 million headwind to ACV and revenue, which was not contemplated in our third quarter guidance. But without this impact, we would have landed near the high-end of our third quarter guidance range on ACV and above the high end of our revenue guidance. Now we expect that the majority of the $20 million to be a timing shift with a small portion of being lost in business. So as you extend into our 2023 outlook \u2013 embedded in the 2023 outlook, it does reflect that incremental operational performance and the momentum that we've seen in the business overall, which is of course, offset by the impact from the export compliance changes, but for the full year in 2023, we expect the impact from incremental export restrictions in the vetting processes in China to have a $25 million impact on ACV and revenue, and we believe just to kind of give a rough sizing, about a third of that is loss of business and two-thirds of that would be an expected timing shift from the elongated transaction cycle. So the effect of this will mute 2023 growth in China. Now as we look to the future, the incremental export restrictions and vetting processes, we also believe will mute ANSYS' ACV and revenue growth in China in 2024 and we expect that impact just \u2013 since you asked about sizing, we expect it to be about $10 million to $30 million on both ACV and revenue in the full year in 2024. And as the majority of that headwind will be loss of business, we would expect the 2024 cash impact to be similar in that range as well. Now despite these headwinds, in February, we still expect to initiate full year 2024 guidance on our model with ACV around 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A. And really, the double-digit performance we saw year-to-date, the strong pipeline and momentum in our business, all of these really give us the confidence not only in our 2024 outlook, but in our ability to achieve our long-term outlook which, of course, was a 12% constant currency ACV growth, including tuck-in M&A and $3 billion of cumulative unlevered operating cash flows from 2022 to 2025. Sure. It was a combination of both. So as you know, our business model has been shifting to subscription lease over the long-term. And this year in particular, you've seen just generally outside of this quarter a sponsorship to lease [ph]. And so there was a mix of both that were impacted in the quarter Yes. So my reference to the 2023 impact of about two-thirds timing shift and one-third loss of business translates to 2024 as well, right. So the nature of this process is really just kind of an extension of that sales cycle, which in the current outlook we\u2019re seeing, is kind of a shift of that business, kind of to the right, if you will. But the $10 million to $30 million of headwind that we\u2019re expecting to see next year related to this specifically, is our best estimate as to what would be the net loss in 2024. Good morning. Sorry, are you talking about the industrial \u2013 the industry mix chart? I just want to make sure exactly what you are referring to. Yes. So. Yes, I would say so it is the industry \u2013 that the processes \u2013 the incremental vetting processes apply to essentially prospects in China that are regardless of industry, right. And so there\u2019s additional restrictions that may be specific, but the incremental processes are agnostic across industry. The dynamics that you\u2019re referring to just to kind of answer that particular question. So when you look at those industry mix charts, those that the relative \u2013 those kind of sizings of representation by industry are all relative. So really relative growth is more of what\u2019s driving the mix shift in those countries. And so all of our largest industries have grown. Given \u2013 but given the strong 12 months performance in automotive, that kind of drove the overall mix shift. So it was really about relative strength in automotive than any particular weakness in any other place. Correct. Sure. So, as just one reminder on the overall revenue results that you see in the results, we saw a lot of impact from the 606 accounting change. And so I am going to \u2013 I\u2019ll answer to your question specifically related to that. But also kind of try to give some broader context around ACV because as you recall, this quarter ACV and revenue are highly disconnected. And your Germany answer or your Germany question is actually a prime example of the lease accounting dynamics that played out creating that year-over-year headwind. So, just to use that as an example, in Q3 2022, Germany saw exceptionally robust revenue growth. The revenue growth in Germany was 102% at constant currency. Now, the growth last year was a function of both strong ACV growth, but also the underlying accounting associated with the nature of the mix of transactions in that quarter. And so I think that just gives you kind of a microcosm in Germany being a relatively larger portion of Europe, that was a dynamic that affected overall revenue growth. But when you zoom out and although we don\u2019t give \u2013 we don\u2019t typically provide ACV by geography, but EMEA had good growth on ACV in Q3 and \u2013 which was really reflective of the region\u2019s operational stability. And just to give some kind of color to the dynamics and the underlying industry performance there, high-tech, aerospace and defense, industrial equipment industries all were strong in EMEA. The quarter was highlighted by sales to a global semiconductor manufacturer and supplier. We also saw a multi-year deal with a research and development company in the A&D industry. They provided more users within its growing simulation team to access our solutions. And then we also had a multi-year deal with the European pump manufacturer that added more global users, more products, more physics, and HPC capacity. So more computation. So the revenue results are really emblematic of the dynamics that we talked about and expected in August. But the underlying ACV performance in the region is quite strong. Tyler, you had a follow-up question. Yes. Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that when you look underneath, so, as we said, we expect to initiate in 2024 \u2013 in February, in 2024 on the model. So 10% constant currency growth, excluding tuck-in M&A. Now, the impact of what we\u2019re estimating to be dropout that we are kind of overcoming in that underlying model is the $10 million to $30 million of ACV in revenue. Now, throughout the year, there\u2019s some shift in timing from this year to next year and next year to the year after. But kind of that just is like the permanent shift that we would expect underneath the covers. But in terms of the kind of \u2013 the pure headwind, which is that we\u2019d be wrapping on coming out of 2024, it would be that $10 million to $30 million."

With us today are Ajei Gopal, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nicole Anasenes, Chief Financial Officer; and Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President, Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. DeBriyn for opening remarks. Please go ahead.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Good morning, everyone. Our earnings release, the related prepared remarks document and the link to our second quarter 2023 Form 10-Q have all been posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website. They contain the key financial information and supporting data relative to our second quarter financial results and business update, as well as our Q3 and fiscal year 2023 outlook and the key underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions. Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. important factors that may affect our future results are discussed in our public filings.

During this call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise stated. A discussion of the various items that are excluded and reconciliations of GAAP to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release materials. I would now like to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajei Gopal, for his opening remarks. Ajei?\nAjei Gopal: Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. Building on the momentum of the first quarter of 2023, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS in which we beat our guidance across all key metrics. For the first half of 2023, we saw double-digit growth in ACV and revenue, as well as broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer types. I'm excited about our outstanding performance in Q2 and the first half of the year as well as our strong pipeline. And I'm delighted to announce that we are raising full year guidance for ACV and revenue. Nicole, will have the details in a few minutes. For Q2, our top three contributors by industry for high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation. We saw robust growth in our small and medium-sized accounts and from a geographical perspective, our growth was as we expected. One of our largest contracts of the quarter was a four year 8-figure agreement with a multinational industrial company based in Japan. This long-time ANSYS customer is growing the number of users of our core products while expanding its use of new products across our multiphysics portfolio. As part of this customer's digital transformation, it is using ANSYS to establish a virtual product environment, which is helping to drive the company's sustainability and go-to-market strategies by accelerating its product development initiatives. On our calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several quarters, I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I have highlighted how customers are using our solutions in the development of next-generation semiconductor and I have given you insights into the innovation we are driving across our multiphysics portfolio through our five technology pillars. Given our continuing strength in aerospace and defense, our second largest sector, I would like to use today's call to discuss this critical industry. In fact, our largest contract in the quarter was a nearly $57 million multiyear agreement with a global aerospace and defense company based in the United States. This contract reflects significant growth over the previous contract to keep up with user demand. The aerospace industry has experienced a resurgence since the pandemic with commercial air travel returning to record levels this summer. From a product development perspective, industry leaders are challenging old assumptions about their aircraft. And ANSYS simulation is playing a key role in this industry transformation. For example, in the past, most airplanes were powered by traditional aircraft fuel. Today, though, commercial aircraft manufacturers can choose from those fuels. They can use a SAFB or sustainable aviation fuel blend or they can consider alternative fuels, including hydrogen. These critical choices - impact for an organization, but they also play an important role in sustainability initiatives of aerospace companies. Sustainability is a key driver at aircraft engine maker present with me, which has a vision of enabling the air transportation sector to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. Today, the company's engines are certified to run on 50% SAFB. By using simulation from ANSYS, the company plans to increase that number close to 100%. ANSYS solutions are used in a number of sustainability initiatives at Pratt & Whitney, including developing our hydrogen propulsion system and optimizing the company's geared turbofan which is reducing fuel consumption by 16% and cutting NOx emissions by half. In addition to the fuel source, commercial aerospace companies by using ANSYS simulation to boost the efficiency of their aircraft. For example, technical aircraft services leader, Lufthansa Technik has used ANSYS multiphysics simulation to design a biomimetic coating that emulates shark skin to significantly reduce fuel consumption and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. Using ANSYS, the Company quickly modeled aircraft and aerodynamic behavior in an accurate, robust and computationally efficient manner and accelerated critical certification from the European and U.S. aviation agencies. In its current stage of development, the air short modification already makes two types of Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft more efficient which will have a positive environmental impact. Another consideration for those commercial aerospace leaders is who will pilot the aircraft. Automation technology has already had a profound impact on the industry, and it is one that will continue for the foreseeable future. To better prepare the industry, OneSky Systems is integrating its airspace domain expertise and technology with ANSYS solutions to create AI-based software that streamlines and optimizes the development, validation and certification of autonomous advanced air mobility systems. The collaboration enables OneSky and ANSYS customers to train and validate neural networks with mission-driven simulation to reduce the risk, time and cost required for airworthiness certification. Our success in the commercial aerospace sector was in display at the recent Paris Air Show, where ANSYS exhibited. During the event, we encountered a number of ANSYS customers that are using our simulation to further disrupt the industry. For example, ANSYS customer Rolls-Royce was in Paris to meet with its clients. The company recently announced that it has reduced the time that it takes to perform a crucial thermomechanical model of its gas turbine engines from 1,000 hours to less than 10 hours using ANSYS simulation in a high-performance computing environment. As a result, Rolls-Royce is able to rapidly deliver clean and complex propulsion solutions for safety-critical applications. With our new discussion of the aerospace and defense industry is complete without touching upon developments in the space sector. Given the unforgiving environment of space, and the inability to perform physical testing there, simulation is playing a critical role for space to royal companies. One of our key contracts in Q2 was with a Space 2.0 leader that takes advantage of the full ANSYS portfolio, including our core products as well as newer solutions for materials, motor design, digital mission engineering and digital twins. This three year agreement increases the number of products the company is leveraging, as well as the number of users of ANSYS solutions. One of the trends amongst our Space 2.0 customers is to employ micro satellites to perform certain missions such as delivering radar coverage of broadband services. These small light satellites are less expensive to develop and launch than the heavier traditional ones. ANSYS customer, Astranis launched its first satellite earlier this year with the aim of delivering low-cost broadband service anywhere in the world. With its use of ANSYS mechanical, fluids, electronics and digital mission engineering solutions, Astranis is a great example of customers expanding the role of simulation to include more products and more users. Similarly, we reached an agreement in Q2 with long-time Space 2.0 customer, [ISI], which uses ANSYS analysis and simulation solutions to help deliver synthetic aperture radar coverage of the globe through constellations of small satellites. ANSYS digital mission engineering solutions help the company to design and operate its satellite systems ensuring unparalleled accuracy for Earth imaging and satellite maneuver planning. Here in Pittsburgh, we are eagerly awaiting the launch later this year of Astrobotic Technology's, lunar lander called Peregrine. Using ANSYS multiphysics technology, the company rapidly iterates through lander designs that are capable of withstanding the tremendous pressures of launch, the vacuum of space and the impact of landing. Astrobotic is understanding how its craft will operate in space using guidance navigation simulation. This will help put humans back on the moon and beyond and will further expand our knowledge of the Kosmos. Given aircraft increasing complexity, the need to quickly explore all design options and the complexities of space travel, we believe that simulation will play an even greater role in commercial aerospace and Space 2.0 in the near future. Companies in these sectors must take advantage of all areas of physics, including structures, fluids, electromagnetics, optics and materials. And with our highly scalable solutions and access to high-performance computing via the cloud, ANSYS is in a unique position to propel the industry forward. Turning to our partnership activities. Intel Foundry Services has certified our leading semiconductor solutions for power integrity sign-off verification of integrated circuits designed with the Intel 16 silicon manufacturing process. ANSYS solutions provide unparalleled capacity to analyze a full chip design while verifying the effectiveness of that chip's electrostatic discharge protection circuitry. I'm also pleased to announce a number of developments in our relationship with Samsung Foundry. At the foundry's recent SAFE conference, where my presentation reviewed the importance of 3D ICs and the critical role that ANSYS plays in designing them, Samsung certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC for the company's family of heterogeneous multi-die packaging technologies. Red Hawk-SC, as you may remember, is our power integrity and thermal verification platform. Samsung Foundry also certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC and ANSYS Total Power Integrity signoff solutions for Samsung's latest 2-nanometer silicon process technology. We have also expanded our relationship with Synopsys. Our two companies recently announced a new reference flow for Samsung's 14 LPU technology, which delivers the accuracy of ANSYS' golden sign-off electromagnetic analysis with leading custom design flow from Synopsys. In Q2, we also announced an expansion of our partnership with PTC. Our teams are pursuing more integrated materials management and sustainability workflows between PTC's Creo and Windchill products and ANSYS Granta. This collaboration will help engineers balance performance and environmental footprint priorities as they design products. Turning to our ESG initiatives, I'm very happy to report that ANSYS has been named to USA TODAY's inaugural list of America's climate leaders. The list recognizes companies that have achieved the greatest reduction in core emissions intensity between 2019 and 2021. Finally, I'm excited that ANSYS has been named to Newsweek's list of most loved global workplaces. This recognition celebrates companies with employees who feel included, recognized and valued. ANSYS ranked 27th globally on this precedes list, which is yet another indication of our tremendous team and the impact we are having around the world. In summary, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS. I'm excited that the market is vibrant and the demand for ANSYS solutions remains robust, thanks to the unique value proposition that we provide. With our strong pipeline, our industry-leading portfolio and our deep customer relationships, I am confident in our ability to meet our short- and long-term goals. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and full year 2023. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered solid performance during Q2 and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV came in better than guidance, revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded our guidance, driven by ACV outperformance and the mix of license types sold in the quarter. Given the strength of demand for simulation and the momentum we see in our pipeline, we are raising our full year ACV and revenue. The improvement in our full year ACV outlook is above and beyond our Q2 outperformance. I will provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $488.3 million in Q2, which grew 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Our SMB customers performed well during the quarter, and we saw growth across most industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 13% or 17% in constant currency on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 82% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. Q2 total revenue was $496.6 million and grew 4% or 5% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance driven by the ACV outperformance and the mix of license types in the quarter. Growth for both ACV and revenue by geography was in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, our top line performance was robust with ACV and revenue, both growing double digit in constant currency at 12% and 13%, respectively with broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer types. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.3 billion which grew 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 36.4%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperformance on revenue, the favorable mix of license types, as well as the timing of expenses. The result with second quarter EPS of $1.60, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of the year. Our unlevered operating cash flow in the second quarter totaled $72.1 million and in line with expectations. The underlying momentum in our cash collections remain strong. However, unlevered operating cash flow was down year-over-year due to the timing of tax payments. We ended the quarter with $478 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We delivered an outstanding first half coming off an exceptional 2022 and our updated 2023 forecast reflects the continued broad-based customer demand for our market-leading simulation portfolio. Looking to the remainder of the year, the business continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We are raising our full year ACV outlook to a range of $2.275 billion to $2.340 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 15.2% or 11.4% to 14.6% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance in constant currency growth by 0.5 point. Our improved outlook is in excess of the Q2 overperformance we delivered relative to our Q2 guidance and is partially offset by a few million dollars of foreign exchange headwind. We are increasing our revenue outlook to a range of $2.257 billion to $2.327 billion, which is growth of 8.9% to 12.3% or 8.5% to 11.9% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth by 0.5 point. Within this increased guidance, we are absorbing a similar amount of foreign exchange headwind that we anticipate seeing in ACV. We expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.39 to $8.88. Relative to our May guidance, our updated full year EPS contemplates $0.04 of operational improvement from increased full year revenue guidance, which was more than offset by $0.06 of higher interest expense and onetime items in other expense. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $699 million to $749 million and relative to our May guidance, absorbs the small additional foreign exchange headwind we see in the second half. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now let me turn to guidance for Q3. For the third quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $460.5 million to $480.5 million. Our ACV growth outlook for both Q3 and the full year is 13% constant currency growth at the midpoint, which is above our financial model and an acceleration from the 12% constant currency growth we saw in the first half. Turning to the P&L. We expect Q3 revenue in the range of $453.7 million to $473.7 million. We expect Q3 operating margin in the range of 29.6% to 31.3% and EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.31. As I have noted in the past, quarterly dynamics can be volatile and oftentimes, growth dynamics in the P&L can be disconnected from ACV. The quarterly mix of license types that generate upfront recognition creates a year-over-year headwind in the third quarter, which is causing the P&L to be disconnected from the strong accelerating third quarter and second half ACV outlook. The year-over-year revenue and resulting P&L in the third quarter is not a reflection of a change in business momentum. Our full year raised ACV guidance continues to be the best metric to observe momentum in our business. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q3 are contained in the prepared remarks document. I am really proud of the strong execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our robust pipeline. These factors along with our diversified business and laser focus on execution are giving us business momentum. This is reflected in increased outlook for ACV and revenue. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your dedication to delighting our customers and delivering world-class innovation. Your efforts not only contributed to our strong performance in the first half of 2023, but also fuels the continued momentum going into our second half of the year. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Great. Hi, everyone. I wanted to start with a question on AI. And I appreciate this has been part of the product roadmap for a long time. It's been making your flagship products better for a long time. My question is more coming off of the Design Automation Conference during the quarter and hearing about some of the all new products that are in development at ANSYS, things like machine learning-based solvers or even new cloud platforms that will play into AI and simulation data. I just wanted to see the potential for these new things to become additive. And how you think about kind of the new monetizing that would be separate and distinct from what's been playing out within kind of the core silver business, if you will.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. So as I've said before, AI has been part of our road map, and we have five broad areas that we're investing in from a technology perspective to improve the - continue to improve our products. And I talked about them at some length at the last earnings call, so I won't go through all five areas. But AI, of course, is one of those key pillars. We've continued to have investments in area, and we will continue to make investments in AI. And you'll see products coming out as they're ready. We have products in the market already. The broad areas where I think you'll see the benefit and the impact on ANSYS. One is, of course, we'll improve the experience of - the user experience of ANSYS tools. AI plays a role there. We continue to focus on that area. The second is broadly speaking, making simulation easier to use. And you may have seen a recent announcement that we made about ANSYS GPT which is a virtual support technology that's based on GPT, which is really designed to help customers use ANSYS solutions more easily, it's a virtual multilingual tool, and it can go against our information and summarize public information in a way that's appropriate based on how the user is using our technology. So that's a really interesting use case that we've made available recently. And then, of course, we've been focusing on making simulation faster, and that's making our products faster. I talked about this at the last earnings call, and one of the examples I gave was on - in the area of optimization. And I think I gave an example of a customer who's using our multivariate optimization using our AI capabilities and they're in a position as a large European automaker and they were in a position to get to an ADAS solution 1,000x faster than using traditional Monte Carlo simulations. So there's a lot of exciting things that are taking place as we start to look at the overall AI landscape. Does that answer your question?\nJoe Vruwink: Yes, that's great. Thank you, Ajei. And then as a quick follow-up, just given the focus on Aerospace and Defense cord, I wanted to ask how has the evolution of ACV or maybe a net retention rate is the best way to think about this within existing customers in this end market, you obviously talked about a really big deal in the quarter. There's an occurring customer but expanding how they use ANSYS. I guess what's kind of the experience broadly across the end market? And are you seeing not just multiphysics as a driver, but more cross-pollination between the simulation business and the new acquired solutions spanning into missions engineering?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean what I would say generally is the dynamics that we see are really across all three dimensions of the growth drivers that we see, right? So the example that we highlighted in our remarks was an example of a customer who already use broad sets of capabilities, added a couple of additional capabilities, but really was demand was supply constrained in terms of their - the licenses that they had to be able to accommodate the breadth of the users that we're propagating it. These - in the aerospace and defense space, in particular, these are very complex multiphysics problems, which drive really significant amount of computation, right? And so the license constraint that customers face that is driving growth also has that third dimension of our growth model around needing to have additional capacity to accommodate the computational complexity of all the things they have. So I think the aerospace and defense industry given kind of the tipping points and at the beginning of some of the transformations that it's going through is very emblematic of what an industry can an industry experiences in their evolution of ANSYS software because it comes from those adding more products to solve the solution, driving more usage across the development life cycle and then the problems themselves are very complicated. I don't know, Ajei, if you'd have anything to add.\nJoe Vruwink: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, following up on the commentary about the aerospace and defense market. It is very interesting to see how it has now become your second largest market, surpassing automotive for which for many years, it was a pretty similar percent. But it's also interesting to consider that I think the A&D market is perhaps somewhat more concentrated in terms of the customers and a number of logos, for example, and how are you thinking about the sustainability of that kind of growth for A&D, which has been outgrowing your largest market, high tech and could you foresee, for example, that perhaps automotive might start seeing an acceleration for the same kind of reasons that you've been seeing the acceleration in A&D.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, Jay. So it's a really interesting point when you consider the dynamics of every individual market, they go through different drivers that are changing the way people are thinking or changing the level of innovation that's taking place in specific markets. And of course, when we talk about markets, we're talking about end markets. And so if you consider any end customer, they're relying on a supply chain of components some of which would be considered to be from that same end market and some of which will be produced, for example, semiconductors would come from the high-tech vertical. We may be selling to a customer in the supply chain, but they're providing semiconductors that ultimately might get used in the - in building an airplane, for example. So it crosses industry verticals. But that being said, that's how we categorize the end markets. Look, aerospace is going through a really interesting transition, as I mentioned. That's one of the reasons I highlighted on the call. It's not just fuels, as I discussed, there is a whole discussion taking place in the industry about different kinds of takeoff modalities is vertical takeoff, is it short takeoff, is it traditional electric motors versus more traditional prunes of propulsion. There's a number of different vectors where there are conversations taking place. I mentioned the Paris Air Show at the - in my script, I was actually at that air show, and I had an opportunity to meet with some of our very large customers. As you point out, we have some very large aerospace companies who are customers of ours. But it was really interesting walking around the show floor. They were thousands of people representing small companies, booths all over the place where these are small companies that are part of this supply chain dealing with this changing landscape that the aerospace industry is dealing with right now. And there's a dizzying number of designs of aircraft and there are smaller companies out there pursuing their dreams and pursuing their opportunity. And every single one of those companies is designing technology, building technology which makes them either potential customers of ANSYS or perhaps already customers of ANSYS. So it's a really vibrant area. Every one of these verticals goes through its ups and it goes through its drivers but we're very excited about the aerospace market. We have some great technologies and capabilities from a more traditional physics, things like mission engineering, there's lots of different interesting technologies that we can bring to bear to support the transformation of these aerospace companies or to help them achieve what they're trying to do in this rapidly changing market.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Okay. As a follow-up, I'll ask the obligatory AIML question. Three weeks ago at the EDA conference, I ask the CTO a very interesting keynote on AI and depicted an unusually detailed road map for your AI product releases, over 15 products just this year alone, across nine different stacks. And it was an earlier question about AI. But what I want to see if you could tie this into is how do, you see AI affecting new use cases, which you have posited as an important growth driver for you over and above renewals, and as well for what you call integrated workflows or industry solutions, which you've also commented on as a growth driver for you?\nAjei Gopal: Well, look, there's obviously a lot of discussion about AI and Joe asked the question earlier. As I've said multiple times, this is an area we've been investing in. We have product activity. We have customer activity. And obviously, there are use cases that we're driving that are perhaps made more interesting through the use of AI. And I talked about the use of multivariate optimization, for example, and how AI technique can improve that for the perspective of being able to get to optimize and iterate to be able to get to the design. But I think I'll take a slightly different angle here to respond to your question as well. And let's talk a little bit about the end markets. And so, when you think about sort of the design activity, clearly, we see, and as I've articulated, we see AI, we see the use of AI, helping us run our own company. That's obviously something that we will do as every other company will do. So that's no different from every other company. The second is, and I've talked at length about this, is the use of AI to improve our products, making simulation easier to use, making simulation faster, the user experience. I'm not going to go into that. The third is really how do, we see the end markets being affected potentially by AI. And if you look at it from that perspective, if you - the high-tech and semiconductor industry is clearly being affected most - sort of at the most leading edge. And so we have customers - we have customers like NVIDIA, for example, they're taking advantage of our technologies to be able to pursue the physical design limits to be able to manage risk as they start to use Red Hawk Raptor, all of our products to improve their design. You look at Cerebras, for example, they're using Red Hawk-SC for their wafer-scale engine, which is really focused on the AI market and they're helping. And we're helping them with challenges of mixed signal power integrity with electrostatic discharge and things of that nature. So those are just a couple of examples of customers in the high-tech market, but clearly, that's the leading edge in terms of how this is being - this is being rolled out, if you will, in customers. When you think about some of the other heavier industries, it's important to recognize that these industries have a longer design cycle than the high-tech market. So when you think about aerospace, and we've just talked about aerospace or you think about automotive, they have development cycles that are longer than the traditional high tech cycle. And so, as they start to incorporate more AI techniques into their products, it starts to change. It will have an impact, but the impact is a little bit further out as we see it. Now from our perspective, the use of AI. The reason we're talking about this is that as customers start to take more use of AI to help drive, for example, design iterations, we feel that, that drives greater use of simulation, because as you start to use AI technique, for example, to explore different design options that drives more simulation, because simulation is validating whether those designs make sense or not. It's sort of the - question about generative design that we've had for some time. And so, that translates into additional simulation intensity, which benefits ANSYS. So as we start to look at some of these markets, the end markets, they will develop at different rates and paces. But net-net, as these markets develop, it continues to be a long-term tailwind for ANSYS as they - as customers are driving more design options and exploring more design spaces as AI techniques give them that capability.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Great. Thank you, Ajei.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nNicole Anasenes: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning Ajei and the call I can see.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, Just a question - you highlighted sort of strength in small and medium enterprises. And I just want to dig in into it from two angles. A) I think you sort of said that small and medium enterprises tend to lead just larger enterprises in terms of sort of economic sensitivity. So is there a message here on how the underlying demand for software is doing? And second, just maybe an update on ANSYS start-up program. What are you seeing there? Is that accelerating?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So yes, as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've seen pretty sustained performance in the SMB sector throughout the first half. And when you look - and when you look at the total first half performance, we've seen broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer segments entirely. So when you look at where we're sitting year-to-date and where we're looking on a go-forward basis, it is that underlying broad-based strength that has persisted in the first half that we're expecting to see in the second half, because we haven't seen any changes in that profile overall. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the underlying momentum in our business and what's driving it. As it relates to the ANSYS start-up program. We've helped more than 1,900 start-ups from over 58 countries. We've graduated more than 415 start-ups to commercial relationships once they're commercially viable. I mean these are - this is a really I think, successful program to be at the forefront of simulation first R&D thinking. And we're really, really proud of the teams that have kind of worked closely with these start-ups to be able to help them - to help get their processes aligned to that simulation first model. So - we're really happy with the progress of the program. It drives a lot of momentum. Again, it's not a program that drives massive amounts of near-term ACV, but it is an indication of where our thought leadership is and where our influence is in kind of being forward thinking about how the future of R&D can look.\nAjei Gopal: I was just going to say there were a couple of companies that you may know that have graduated from the program that have done very well Relativity is an example Climb works is another example. So we've had a number of customers have taken advantage of this in their early stages have gone on to see tremendous success.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question. As global supply chains, you globalize that on the margin, you are sort of rebuilding tech ecosystem in the U.S. with semis, EV plants. How does sort of this impact your ACV growth was the fact that more incremental growth is shifting to North America. If you could just expand on that. That's a longer-term question? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean what I would say is, just as a reminder, where we - where our business is placed is really in the R&D space, right? So the question you're answering about kind of decoupling and moving is a complex answer, because the - it's a complex question to answer, because it really relies upon an understanding of what is the nature of what actually happens in that decoupling. If it's lift and shift of manufacturing than it isn't as exposed to the R&D cycle as fundamentally changing the way R&D works or changing the innovation model or the way the process of R&D works which would be more amenable to where the role of simulation plays, because we\u2026\nAndrew Obin: That exactly the part. That's my question. Yes. That's my question. So what are you?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So that - I mean, so that's the - yes, so what I would say is that it is too early to tell, because the R&D is - the decoupling is really a mixed dynamic around shifting manufacturing and where customers are still in the early process of thinking about what that looks like and what it changes, right? So, I would say that there isn't anything definitive to point to at this moment, but that is the framework for how I would think about, where it would impact our business and where it wouldn't impact our business.\nAndrew Obin: Well, really appreciate the answer. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you about a couple of trends that you're seeing in the semiconductor market, partially as it relates to generative AI. But you talked a little bit about how, obviously, the auto industry is pivoting more towards building custom chips just as vehicle complexity rises. And then obviously, as GPUs are taking off, because of generative AI workloads. I guess my question is, how are you seeing kind of the simulation intensity, and attach rate differ in some of these new types of chips, whether it's from the auto industry, making their own chips or in a GPU chip relative to CPU where you're probably more dominant historically? Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: So, there are a couple of areas that I think are important to consider. One is when you consider some of these high-performance chips that are being built, there's - there are - and you look at sort of advanced designs. One is being able to get certified for the most of being able to support the most advanced process node capability as we can, that's certainly very important. And the amount of simulation that's necessary given the cost of failure, if you will, of a failed tape-out, amount of simulation that's necessary is quite significant. And so for the sign off at these advanced process nodes, you clearly need a lot of simulation. And so that's obviously a tailwind for us, because the AI workloads are creating these very complex chip sets. The second thing is that as you start to think about a next-generation silicon design technology, you're starting to look at 3D ICs or stack chiplets. And then that really changes the kind of technologies that are necessary to support that are different from traditional -- from the more traditional SoC kind of designs that people have worked with. There are two sort of primary ways of thinking about those challenges. One is that you're dealing with multiscale challenges because now you're dealing as a semiconductor designer, you're now dealing with chip design, which is at the nanometer scale, you're dealing with things like package design at the millimeter scale and then PCP design at the centimeter scale. And the fact that you are dealing with these multiple different levels of scale introduces a lot of challenges and the physics challenges can change as you scale. So for example, thermal effects, which can smooth out the temperature on very small chip geometry scales, but large temperature differences can appear when you're dealing with sizable multi-die modules. And so, that's really one challenge of scale. The second challenge is of multiphysics and in that case, you're dealing not just, because you're dealing with this novel structure, you're not just dealing with the traditional challenges of SoCs, you're dealing also with the fact that you've got interconnections between the different chip labs. So for example, you worry about electromagnetic interference, for example. And so you need to do electromagnetic simulation to prevent that EMI to ensure signal integrity, you've got to be able to handle cooling and warpage reliable soda ball connection. So, there's photonics. So there's a number of different areas where you're bringing in different physics from what you may have traditionally used to build out and SoC or traditional ship. And so, that's another area where we really shine because our technology is about multiphysics. We can help our customers with 3D ICs, deal with these challenges of multiscale and multiphysics and I think that, that puts us in a really good place. So, we're very excited about what we can offer as customers are building some of these next-generation silicon and systems to address the needs of AIML.\nTyler Radke: That's helpful. And Nicole, just on the performance you saw here in the second quarter and Q3 outlook. It sounded like there was a lot of strength in Europe and APAC, at least in the prepared remarks. Could you talk a little bit about the U.S. performance? I know you did beat the midpoint of the guide here in Q2 on ACV, but it was the lowest growth rate we've seen for a while, and it seems like duration came in a bit softer. Was there any type of change in contract duration just maybe driven by macro conditions? Just help us understand the seasonality and trends that you saw in the U.S.? Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So first, I'll start off by saying that the overall dynamics in the quarter that we saw from a geography mix standpoint, from a deal mix standpoint, are very much in line with what we expected when we initiated guidance. So, there's nothing that was surprising or that changed in the quarter that is different from the outcome. And when you look at Americas overall, Americas has led the company in creating value for customers, and we continue to expect it to be - it's our largest region. We continue to expect it to be a strong performer and revenue growth in the quarter was 12% in constant currency. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, some emblematic large deals that we had in the quarter. So, the quarterly dynamics around what we delivered in Americas was in line with the expectations we had. And then in the geographic mix overall, we're really pleased with the performance that we saw in Asia Pacific and EMEA as well, as we pointed out in our prepared remarks. And we had pretty diversified industry dynamics and growth in APAC as an example, aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial equipment performed really well. When you look at EMEA, we had similar kind of broad industry growth, automotive and ground transportation, A&D and industrial equipment were all strong. Materials and Chemicals were also particularly strong. So we saw a quarter in Q2 very much in the way in which we envisioned it would play out. And it actually ended up being a little bit better which allowed us to beat the midpoint of our guidance in the quarter. And the dynamics in the building pipeline that we've seen across the globe, across industries, geographies, customer segments is what gave us the confidence to raise the full year ACV by 0.5 point, which is in excess of the beat that we had in Q2.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a two part question on the M&A side. Just wondering if, first, you could maybe elaborate a little bit the Diakopto acquisition and maybe Nicole, could you just tell us what the contribution is from a percent growth in the second half or a dollar amount as any kind. And then secondly, Ajei, maybe if you could touch on the EDA portfolio that you have. Do you expect to invest more in that? And more broadly, do you - how do you balance that with your partnership with Synopsys. Thanks.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. So let me just give you the quick rationale for Diakopto and then I'll turn it back over to Nicole and then maybe I can answer the question. So Diakopto was really IP that was complementary to our core business. It was developed by a relatively small but extremely high performance team of subject matter experts. They were very early in their commercialization process. And it was really about shifting left in the design cycle. So they were addressing some key challenges for analog and mixed signal circuit design. And that application is important for things like automotive, electronics and RF communications and things of that nature. So it's a very natural complement to our existing semiconductor products. as I said, it supports that shift left. Nicole, do you want?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. And as Ajei said, I mean this was - this is an amazing technology, great IP really talented team, it was not in an advanced commercial phase. So there's no material impact from this particular acquisition in the quarter or in the second half outlook.\nAjei Gopal: So with respect to the question that you asked about how our portfolio fits in, I think you asked on semiconductors. Look, we have historically had one of the areas of sort of golden sign off, if you will, with our ANSYS RedHawk portfolio dealing with things like power integrity and thermal effects and so forth. And that's been an area that we have continued to make investments in, and we are very, very excited about our product capabilities. Like I talked about some of the certifications we have received from the foundries and at the most advanced process nodes. And we're very excited about that. As you look more broadly though, going into the future, I talked at some length about 3D ICs and the use of the multiphysics portfolio. And that's really bringing in different technologies that were historically not being used by people who are designing traditional ICs, and you start to think about thermal effects and others. Depending on the placements of this, I mean, we talked about the automotive segment. If you're putting in chips into cars, you have to now recognize that these chips are not sitting in air-conditioned environments, they are sitting in a car, which could be extremely - could get extremely hot. It can get lots of vibrations. So there's a whole different set of analysis that needs to be done to be able to ensure the reliability of these solutions for these different use cases that are increasingly becoming common. And that leads to the traditional ANSYS portfolio. And so we believe in an open ecosystem, we believe in partnering and certainly, we're excited about our areas of our strength. And obviously, we're in a position to make sure that we work with other vendors to ultimately make sure that our customers are successful.\nKelsey DeBriyn: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will be from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for letting me in.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just maybe talk about just the mechanics of the third quarter just from an accounting perspective, like - just a little more color on what's driving those headlines just mechanically. Obviously, there's - it reflects some sort of a change in behavior to a degree. Obviously, as you put it, doesn't really change the longer-term value in the cash flows. But just maybe a little more color on the moving parts there on the non-GAAP income statement front.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes, sure. So as I've noted in the past, we haven't had a quarter that has this much disconnection in a couple of quarters in quite a while. But sometimes you have a quarter where you can have a meaningful disconnect between the P&L and ACV. So again, if you look at the underlying ACV growth in the quarter and in the half, it is accelerating both from the first half and throughout Q3 and Q4. And so the overall dynamics around ECB, which is the basis of cash generation are very consistent. Now in the quarter, the mix of license types which generate upfront recognition within the Q3 outlook, is relatively lower in 2022 versus 2023. So that's what's creating the year-over-year headwind in the quarter and that's what's causing the disconnect between the P&L in the quarter from the strong and accelerating third quarter and second half ACV outlook. Now when you look that year-over-year revenue and the resulting P&L in the third quarter, as we said, it's not a reflection of momentum or any change in the business. And when you - if you consider the full year guidance and the Q3 guidance, and you can evaluate the implied Q4 revenue growth, you can see that, that outlook returns to strong double-digit growth. And so that's the reason why we've - our full year ACV guidance is really the best metric to observe momentum in our business. And that's where we've seen kind of the continued progress and momentum. The increased just under 1.5 points since February of our outlook in ACV with - when you add this additional half point that we gave. So that's the underlying dynamic that's driving the disconnect between the quarter and the - I'm sorry, the quarter and the full year.\nSteve Tusa: So just as a follow-up to that. So just mechanically, like what is actually changing between the third and the fourth quarter, just on the ground, again, acknowledging that it doesn't change ACV or cash flow. But like what - is there any vertical where there's a bit of a different SKU or profile? Or what is kind of the change on the ground that drives this kind of volatility in that P&L. Like what do you read into at a high level?\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So there's really nothing operational because the pipeline is the pipeline and the mix of kind of license types that renew are those that were new. So there's nothing really operational. But on occasion, you can get the comparison of a high mix of upfront of license types that have upfront recognition like perpetual licenses or multiyear leases compared to a different period where you have a relatively different mix, a higher mix of one-year leases as an example, right? So you can have a different mix in a comparative period, which drives anomalies in growth rates but it doesn't fundamentally change the overall dynamics in the business. In fact, if you look at the overall SKU of the business and the implied SKU of what we're delivering kind of implied in the guidance in the second half of the year, it is very consistent with what has been done in prior quarters. It's just that the revenue recognition rules can tend to have some really odd comparative dynamics when you have the comparative of license types mix in one period versus the comparison in another period. And so that's a dynamic that is sometimes challenging. It hasn't happened in a couple of quarters, but every once in a while, you have a quarter where you have just a very different dynamic on a quarter-to-quarter - year-over-year basis within a quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, makes a ton of sense. Thanks. I really appreciate it.\nKelsey DeBriyn: No problem. Thank you for joining us today. That's all the time we have. And I will turn it over to Ajei for closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: I'm excited by our excellent execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our strong pipeline. Those factors as well as a proven track record of success and our unique value proposition adds to my confidence in our ability to achieve our goals. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS and at our global channel partners for their commitment, focus and their many successes. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. Building on the momentum of the first quarter of 2023, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS in which we beat our guidance across all key metrics. For the first half of 2023, we saw double-digit growth in ACV and revenue, as well as broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer types. I'm excited about our outstanding performance in Q2 and the first half of the year as well as our strong pipeline. And I'm delighted to announce that we are raising full year guidance for ACV and revenue. Nicole, will have the details in a few minutes. For Q2, our top three contributors by industry for high-tech and semiconductors, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation. We saw robust growth in our small and medium-sized accounts and from a geographical perspective, our growth was as we expected. One of our largest contracts of the quarter was a four year 8-figure agreement with a multinational industrial company based in Japan. This long-time ANSYS customer is growing the number of users of our core products while expanding its use of new products across our multiphysics portfolio. As part of this customer's digital transformation, it is using ANSYS to establish a virtual product environment, which is helping to drive the company's sustainability and go-to-market strategies by accelerating its product development initiatives. On our calls, I typically highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several quarters, I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I have highlighted how customers are using our solutions in the development of next-generation semiconductor and I have given you insights into the innovation we are driving across our multiphysics portfolio through our five technology pillars. Given our continuing strength in aerospace and defense, our second largest sector, I would like to use today's call to discuss this critical industry. In fact, our largest contract in the quarter was a nearly $57 million multiyear agreement with a global aerospace and defense company based in the United States. This contract reflects significant growth over the previous contract to keep up with user demand. The aerospace industry has experienced a resurgence since the pandemic with commercial air travel returning to record levels this summer. From a product development perspective, industry leaders are challenging old assumptions about their aircraft. And ANSYS simulation is playing a key role in this industry transformation. For example, in the past, most airplanes were powered by traditional aircraft fuel. Today, though, commercial aircraft manufacturers can choose from those fuels. They can use a SAFB or sustainable aviation fuel blend or they can consider alternative fuels, including hydrogen. These critical choices - impact for an organization, but they also play an important role in sustainability initiatives of aerospace companies. Sustainability is a key driver at aircraft engine maker present with me, which has a vision of enabling the air transportation sector to achieve net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. Today, the company's engines are certified to run on 50% SAFB. By using simulation from ANSYS, the company plans to increase that number close to 100%. ANSYS solutions are used in a number of sustainability initiatives at Pratt & Whitney, including developing our hydrogen propulsion system and optimizing the company's geared turbofan which is reducing fuel consumption by 16% and cutting NOx emissions by half. In addition to the fuel source, commercial aerospace companies by using ANSYS simulation to boost the efficiency of their aircraft. For example, technical aircraft services leader, Lufthansa Technik has used ANSYS multiphysics simulation to design a biomimetic coating that emulates shark skin to significantly reduce fuel consumption and the associated carbon dioxide emissions. Using ANSYS, the Company quickly modeled aircraft and aerodynamic behavior in an accurate, robust and computationally efficient manner and accelerated critical certification from the European and U.S. aviation agencies. In its current stage of development, the air short modification already makes two types of Boeing 777 long-haul aircraft more efficient which will have a positive environmental impact. Another consideration for those commercial aerospace leaders is who will pilot the aircraft. Automation technology has already had a profound impact on the industry, and it is one that will continue for the foreseeable future. To better prepare the industry, OneSky Systems is integrating its airspace domain expertise and technology with ANSYS solutions to create AI-based software that streamlines and optimizes the development, validation and certification of autonomous advanced air mobility systems. The collaboration enables OneSky and ANSYS customers to train and validate neural networks with mission-driven simulation to reduce the risk, time and cost required for airworthiness certification. Our success in the commercial aerospace sector was in display at the recent Paris Air Show, where ANSYS exhibited. During the event, we encountered a number of ANSYS customers that are using our simulation to further disrupt the industry. For example, ANSYS customer Rolls-Royce was in Paris to meet with its clients. The company recently announced that it has reduced the time that it takes to perform a crucial thermomechanical model of its gas turbine engines from 1,000 hours to less than 10 hours using ANSYS simulation in a high-performance computing environment. As a result, Rolls-Royce is able to rapidly deliver clean and complex propulsion solutions for safety-critical applications. With our new discussion of the aerospace and defense industry is complete without touching upon developments in the space sector. Given the unforgiving environment of space, and the inability to perform physical testing there, simulation is playing a critical role for space to royal companies. One of our key contracts in Q2 was with a Space 2.0 leader that takes advantage of the full ANSYS portfolio, including our core products as well as newer solutions for materials, motor design, digital mission engineering and digital twins. This three year agreement increases the number of products the company is leveraging, as well as the number of users of ANSYS solutions. One of the trends amongst our Space 2.0 customers is to employ micro satellites to perform certain missions such as delivering radar coverage of broadband services. These small light satellites are less expensive to develop and launch than the heavier traditional ones. ANSYS customer, Astranis launched its first satellite earlier this year with the aim of delivering low-cost broadband service anywhere in the world. With its use of ANSYS mechanical, fluids, electronics and digital mission engineering solutions, Astranis is a great example of customers expanding the role of simulation to include more products and more users. Similarly, we reached an agreement in Q2 with long-time Space 2.0 customer, [ISI], which uses ANSYS analysis and simulation solutions to help deliver synthetic aperture radar coverage of the globe through constellations of small satellites. ANSYS digital mission engineering solutions help the company to design and operate its satellite systems ensuring unparalleled accuracy for Earth imaging and satellite maneuver planning. Here in Pittsburgh, we are eagerly awaiting the launch later this year of Astrobotic Technology's, lunar lander called Peregrine. Using ANSYS multiphysics technology, the company rapidly iterates through lander designs that are capable of withstanding the tremendous pressures of launch, the vacuum of space and the impact of landing. Astrobotic is understanding how its craft will operate in space using guidance navigation simulation. This will help put humans back on the moon and beyond and will further expand our knowledge of the Kosmos. Given aircraft increasing complexity, the need to quickly explore all design options and the complexities of space travel, we believe that simulation will play an even greater role in commercial aerospace and Space 2.0 in the near future. Companies in these sectors must take advantage of all areas of physics, including structures, fluids, electromagnetics, optics and materials. And with our highly scalable solutions and access to high-performance computing via the cloud, ANSYS is in a unique position to propel the industry forward. Turning to our partnership activities. Intel Foundry Services has certified our leading semiconductor solutions for power integrity sign-off verification of integrated circuits designed with the Intel 16 silicon manufacturing process. ANSYS solutions provide unparalleled capacity to analyze a full chip design while verifying the effectiveness of that chip's electrostatic discharge protection circuitry. I'm also pleased to announce a number of developments in our relationship with Samsung Foundry. At the foundry's recent SAFE conference, where my presentation reviewed the importance of 3D ICs and the critical role that ANSYS plays in designing them, Samsung certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC for the company's family of heterogeneous multi-die packaging technologies. Red Hawk-SC, as you may remember, is our power integrity and thermal verification platform. Samsung Foundry also certified ANSYS RedHawk-SC and ANSYS Total Power Integrity signoff solutions for Samsung's latest 2-nanometer silicon process technology. We have also expanded our relationship with Synopsys. Our two companies recently announced a new reference flow for Samsung's 14 LPU technology, which delivers the accuracy of ANSYS' golden sign-off electromagnetic analysis with leading custom design flow from Synopsys. In Q2, we also announced an expansion of our partnership with PTC. Our teams are pursuing more integrated materials management and sustainability workflows between PTC's Creo and Windchill products and ANSYS Granta. This collaboration will help engineers balance performance and environmental footprint priorities as they design products. Turning to our ESG initiatives, I'm very happy to report that ANSYS has been named to USA TODAY's inaugural list of America's climate leaders. The list recognizes companies that have achieved the greatest reduction in core emissions intensity between 2019 and 2021. Finally, I'm excited that ANSYS has been named to Newsweek's list of most loved global workplaces. This recognition celebrates companies with employees who feel included, recognized and valued. ANSYS ranked 27th globally on this precedes list, which is yet another indication of our tremendous team and the impact we are having around the world. In summary, Q2 was another excellent quarter for ANSYS. I'm excited that the market is vibrant and the demand for ANSYS solutions remains robust, thanks to the unique value proposition that we provide. With our strong pipeline, our industry-leading portfolio and our deep customer relationships, I am confident in our ability to meet our short- and long-term goals. And with that, I will turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. So as I've said before, AI has been part of our road map, and we have five broad areas that we're investing in from a technology perspective to improve the - continue to improve our products. And I talked about them at some length at the last earnings call, so I won't go through all five areas. But AI, of course, is one of those key pillars. We've continued to have investments in area, and we will continue to make investments in AI. And you'll see products coming out as they're ready. We have products in the market already. The broad areas where I think you'll see the benefit and the impact on ANSYS. One is, of course, we'll improve the experience of - the user experience of ANSYS tools. AI plays a role there. We continue to focus on that area. The second is broadly speaking, making simulation easier to use. And you may have seen a recent announcement that we made about ANSYS GPT which is a virtual support technology that's based on GPT, which is really designed to help customers use ANSYS solutions more easily, it's a virtual multilingual tool, and it can go against our information and summarize public information in a way that's appropriate based on how the user is using our technology. So that's a really interesting use case that we've made available recently. And then, of course, we've been focusing on making simulation faster, and that's making our products faster. I talked about this at the last earnings call, and one of the examples I gave was on - in the area of optimization. And I think I gave an example of a customer who's using our multivariate optimization using our AI capabilities and they're in a position as a large European automaker and they were in a position to get to an ADAS solution 1,000x faster than using traditional Monte Carlo simulations. So there's a lot of exciting things that are taking place as we start to look at the overall AI landscape. Does that answer your question? Good morning, Jay. So it's a really interesting point when you consider the dynamics of every individual market, they go through different drivers that are changing the way people are thinking or changing the level of innovation that's taking place in specific markets. And of course, when we talk about markets, we're talking about end markets. And so if you consider any end customer, they're relying on a supply chain of components some of which would be considered to be from that same end market and some of which will be produced, for example, semiconductors would come from the high-tech vertical. We may be selling to a customer in the supply chain, but they're providing semiconductors that ultimately might get used in the - in building an airplane, for example. So it crosses industry verticals. But that being said, that's how we categorize the end markets. Look, aerospace is going through a really interesting transition, as I mentioned. That's one of the reasons I highlighted on the call. It's not just fuels, as I discussed, there is a whole discussion taking place in the industry about different kinds of takeoff modalities is vertical takeoff, is it short takeoff, is it traditional electric motors versus more traditional prunes of propulsion. There's a number of different vectors where there are conversations taking place. I mentioned the Paris Air Show at the - in my script, I was actually at that air show, and I had an opportunity to meet with some of our very large customers. As you point out, we have some very large aerospace companies who are customers of ours. But it was really interesting walking around the show floor. They were thousands of people representing small companies, booths all over the place where these are small companies that are part of this supply chain dealing with this changing landscape that the aerospace industry is dealing with right now. And there's a dizzying number of designs of aircraft and there are smaller companies out there pursuing their dreams and pursuing their opportunity. And every single one of those companies is designing technology, building technology which makes them either potential customers of ANSYS or perhaps already customers of ANSYS. So it's a really vibrant area. Every one of these verticals goes through its ups and it goes through its drivers but we're very excited about the aerospace market. We have some great technologies and capabilities from a more traditional physics, things like mission engineering, there's lots of different interesting technologies that we can bring to bear to support the transformation of these aerospace companies or to help them achieve what they're trying to do in this rapidly changing market. Well, look, there's obviously a lot of discussion about AI and Joe asked the question earlier. As I've said multiple times, this is an area we've been investing in. We have product activity. We have customer activity. And obviously, there are use cases that we're driving that are perhaps made more interesting through the use of AI. And I talked about the use of multivariate optimization, for example, and how AI technique can improve that for the perspective of being able to get to optimize and iterate to be able to get to the design. But I think I'll take a slightly different angle here to respond to your question as well. And let's talk a little bit about the end markets. And so, when you think about sort of the design activity, clearly, we see, and as I've articulated, we see AI, we see the use of AI, helping us run our own company. That's obviously something that we will do as every other company will do. So that's no different from every other company. The second is, and I've talked at length about this, is the use of AI to improve our products, making simulation easier to use, making simulation faster, the user experience. I'm not going to go into that. The third is really how do, we see the end markets being affected potentially by AI. And if you look at it from that perspective, if you - the high-tech and semiconductor industry is clearly being affected most - sort of at the most leading edge. And so we have customers - we have customers like NVIDIA, for example, they're taking advantage of our technologies to be able to pursue the physical design limits to be able to manage risk as they start to use Red Hawk Raptor, all of our products to improve their design. You look at Cerebras, for example, they're using Red Hawk-SC for their wafer-scale engine, which is really focused on the AI market and they're helping. And we're helping them with challenges of mixed signal power integrity with electrostatic discharge and things of that nature. So those are just a couple of examples of customers in the high-tech market, but clearly, that's the leading edge in terms of how this is being - this is being rolled out, if you will, in customers. When you think about some of the other heavier industries, it's important to recognize that these industries have a longer design cycle than the high-tech market. So when you think about aerospace, and we've just talked about aerospace or you think about automotive, they have development cycles that are longer than the traditional high tech cycle. And so, as they start to incorporate more AI techniques into their products, it starts to change. It will have an impact, but the impact is a little bit further out as we see it. Now from our perspective, the use of AI. The reason we're talking about this is that as customers start to take more use of AI to help drive, for example, design iterations, we feel that, that drives greater use of simulation, because as you start to use AI technique, for example, to explore different design options that drives more simulation, because simulation is validating whether those designs make sense or not. It's sort of the - question about generative design that we've had for some time. And so, that translates into additional simulation intensity, which benefits ANSYS. So as we start to look at some of these markets, the end markets, they will develop at different rates and paces. But net-net, as these markets develop, it continues to be a long-term tailwind for ANSYS as they - as customers are driving more design options and exploring more design spaces as AI techniques give them that capability. Good morning. I was just going to say there were a couple of companies that you may know that have graduated from the program that have done very well Relativity is an example Climb works is another example. So we've had a number of customers have taken advantage of this in their early stages have gone on to see tremendous success. So, there are a couple of areas that I think are important to consider. One is when you consider some of these high-performance chips that are being built, there's - there are - and you look at sort of advanced designs. One is being able to get certified for the most of being able to support the most advanced process node capability as we can, that's certainly very important. And the amount of simulation that's necessary given the cost of failure, if you will, of a failed tape-out, amount of simulation that's necessary is quite significant. And so for the sign off at these advanced process nodes, you clearly need a lot of simulation. And so that's obviously a tailwind for us, because the AI workloads are creating these very complex chip sets. The second thing is that as you start to think about a next-generation silicon design technology, you're starting to look at 3D ICs or stack chiplets. And then that really changes the kind of technologies that are necessary to support that are different from traditional -- from the more traditional SoC kind of designs that people have worked with. There are two sort of primary ways of thinking about those challenges. One is that you're dealing with multiscale challenges because now you're dealing as a semiconductor designer, you're now dealing with chip design, which is at the nanometer scale, you're dealing with things like package design at the millimeter scale and then PCP design at the centimeter scale. And the fact that you are dealing with these multiple different levels of scale introduces a lot of challenges and the physics challenges can change as you scale. So for example, thermal effects, which can smooth out the temperature on very small chip geometry scales, but large temperature differences can appear when you're dealing with sizable multi-die modules. And so, that's really one challenge of scale. The second challenge is of multiphysics and in that case, you're dealing not just, because you're dealing with this novel structure, you're not just dealing with the traditional challenges of SoCs, you're dealing also with the fact that you've got interconnections between the different chip labs. So for example, you worry about electromagnetic interference, for example. And so you need to do electromagnetic simulation to prevent that EMI to ensure signal integrity, you've got to be able to handle cooling and warpage reliable soda ball connection. So, there's photonics. So there's a number of different areas where you're bringing in different physics from what you may have traditionally used to build out and SoC or traditional ship. And so, that's another area where we really shine because our technology is about multiphysics. We can help our customers with 3D ICs, deal with these challenges of multiscale and multiphysics and I think that, that puts us in a really good place. So, we're very excited about what we can offer as customers are building some of these next-generation silicon and systems to address the needs of AIML. Yes. So let me just give you the quick rationale for Diakopto and then I'll turn it back over to Nicole and then maybe I can answer the question. So Diakopto was really IP that was complementary to our core business. It was developed by a relatively small but extremely high performance team of subject matter experts. They were very early in their commercialization process. And it was really about shifting left in the design cycle. So they were addressing some key challenges for analog and mixed signal circuit design. And that application is important for things like automotive, electronics and RF communications and things of that nature. So it's a very natural complement to our existing semiconductor products. as I said, it supports that shift left. Nicole, do you want? So with respect to the question that you asked about how our portfolio fits in, I think you asked on semiconductors. Look, we have historically had one of the areas of sort of golden sign off, if you will, with our ANSYS RedHawk portfolio dealing with things like power integrity and thermal effects and so forth. And that's been an area that we have continued to make investments in, and we are very, very excited about our product capabilities. Like I talked about some of the certifications we have received from the foundries and at the most advanced process nodes. And we're very excited about that. As you look more broadly though, going into the future, I talked at some length about 3D ICs and the use of the multiphysics portfolio. And that's really bringing in different technologies that were historically not being used by people who are designing traditional ICs, and you start to think about thermal effects and others. Depending on the placements of this, I mean, we talked about the automotive segment. If you're putting in chips into cars, you have to now recognize that these chips are not sitting in air-conditioned environments, they are sitting in a car, which could be extremely - could get extremely hot. It can get lots of vibrations. So there's a whole different set of analysis that needs to be done to be able to ensure the reliability of these solutions for these different use cases that are increasingly becoming common. And that leads to the traditional ANSYS portfolio. And so we believe in an open ecosystem, we believe in partnering and certainly, we're excited about our areas of our strength. And obviously, we're in a position to make sure that we work with other vendors to ultimately make sure that our customers are successful. Good morning, Steve. I'm excited by our excellent execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our strong pipeline. Those factors as well as a proven track record of success and our unique value proposition adds to my confidence in our ability to achieve our goals. I want to thank all my colleagues at ANSYS and at our global channel partners for their commitment, focus and their many successes. Thank you for joining us, and have a great day."

            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q3 and full year 2023. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our business as we delivered solid performance during Q2 and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV came in better than guidance, revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded our guidance, driven by ACV outperformance and the mix of license types sold in the quarter. Given the strength of demand for simulation and the momentum we see in our pipeline, we are raising our full year ACV and revenue. The improvement in our full year ACV outlook is above and beyond our Q2 outperformance. I will provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now let me discuss some of our Q2 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $488.3 million in Q2, which grew 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Our SMB customers performed well during the quarter, and we saw growth across most industries. ACV from recurring sources grew 13% or 17% in constant currency on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 82% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift towards subscription lease licenses. Q2 total revenue was $496.6 million and grew 4% or 5% in constant currency, which, as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance driven by the ACV outperformance and the mix of license types in the quarter. Growth for both ACV and revenue by geography was in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, our top line performance was robust with ACV and revenue, both growing double digit in constant currency at 12% and 13%, respectively with broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer types. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.3 billion which grew 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver a business model with strong operating leverage. This yielded a solid second quarter gross margin of 91% and an operating margin of 36.4%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperformance on revenue, the favorable mix of license types, as well as the timing of expenses. The result with second quarter EPS of $1.60, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of expenses. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of the year. Our unlevered operating cash flow in the second quarter totaled $72.1 million and in line with expectations. The underlying momentum in our cash collections remain strong. However, unlevered operating cash flow was down year-over-year due to the timing of tax payments. We ended the quarter with $478 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We delivered an outstanding first half coming off an exceptional 2022 and our updated 2023 forecast reflects the continued broad-based customer demand for our market-leading simulation portfolio. Looking to the remainder of the year, the business continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We are raising our full year ACV outlook to a range of $2.275 billion to $2.340 billion, which represents growth of 12% to 15.2% or 11.4% to 14.6% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance in constant currency growth by 0.5 point. Our improved outlook is in excess of the Q2 overperformance we delivered relative to our Q2 guidance and is partially offset by a few million dollars of foreign exchange headwind. We are increasing our revenue outlook to a range of $2.257 billion to $2.327 billion, which is growth of 8.9% to 12.3% or 8.5% to 11.9% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth by 0.5 point. Within this increased guidance, we are absorbing a similar amount of foreign exchange headwind that we anticipate seeing in ACV. We expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.39 to $8.88. Relative to our May guidance, our updated full year EPS contemplates $0.04 of operational improvement from increased full year revenue guidance, which was more than offset by $0.06 of higher interest expense and onetime items in other expense. Now let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $699 million to $749 million and relative to our May guidance, absorbs the small additional foreign exchange headwind we see in the second half. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now let me turn to guidance for Q3. For the third quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $460.5 million to $480.5 million. Our ACV growth outlook for both Q3 and the full year is 13% constant currency growth at the midpoint, which is above our financial model and an acceleration from the 12% constant currency growth we saw in the first half. Turning to the P&L. We expect Q3 revenue in the range of $453.7 million to $473.7 million. We expect Q3 operating margin in the range of 29.6% to 31.3% and EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.31. As I have noted in the past, quarterly dynamics can be volatile and oftentimes, growth dynamics in the P&L can be disconnected from ACV. The quarterly mix of license types that generate upfront recognition creates a year-over-year headwind in the third quarter, which is causing the P&L to be disconnected from the strong accelerating third quarter and second half ACV outlook. The year-over-year revenue and resulting P&L in the third quarter is not a reflection of a change in business momentum. Our full year raised ACV guidance continues to be the best metric to observe momentum in our business. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q3 are contained in the prepared remarks document. I am really proud of the strong execution in the first half of the year, our expanding product leadership and our robust pipeline. These factors along with our diversified business and laser focus on execution are giving us business momentum. This is reflected in increased outlook for ACV and revenue. To the entire ANSYS team, thank you for your dedication to delighting our customers and delivering world-class innovation. Your efforts not only contributed to our strong performance in the first half of 2023, but also fuels the continued momentum going into our second half of the year. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone line to take questions. Yes. I mean what I would say generally is the dynamics that we see are really across all three dimensions of the growth drivers that we see, right? So the example that we highlighted in our remarks was an example of a customer who already use broad sets of capabilities, added a couple of additional capabilities, but really was demand was supply constrained in terms of their - the licenses that they had to be able to accommodate the breadth of the users that we're propagating it. These - in the aerospace and defense space, in particular, these are very complex multiphysics problems, which drive really significant amount of computation, right? And so the license constraint that customers face that is driving growth also has that third dimension of our growth model around needing to have additional capacity to accommodate the computational complexity of all the things they have. So I think the aerospace and defense industry given kind of the tipping points and at the beginning of some of the transformations that it's going through is very emblematic of what an industry can an industry experiences in their evolution of ANSYS software because it comes from those adding more products to solve the solution, driving more usage across the development life cycle and then the problems themselves are very complicated. I don't know, Ajei, if you'd have anything to add. Good morning. Sure. So yes, as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've seen pretty sustained performance in the SMB sector throughout the first half. And when you look - and when you look at the total first half performance, we've seen broad-based growth across industries, geographies and customer segments entirely. So when you look at where we're sitting year-to-date and where we're looking on a go-forward basis, it is that underlying broad-based strength that has persisted in the first half that we're expecting to see in the second half, because we haven't seen any changes in that profile overall. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the underlying momentum in our business and what's driving it. As it relates to the ANSYS start-up program. We've helped more than 1,900 start-ups from over 58 countries. We've graduated more than 415 start-ups to commercial relationships once they're commercially viable. I mean these are - this is a really I think, successful program to be at the forefront of simulation first R&D thinking. And we're really, really proud of the teams that have kind of worked closely with these start-ups to be able to help them - to help get their processes aligned to that simulation first model. So - we're really happy with the progress of the program. It drives a lot of momentum. Again, it's not a program that drives massive amounts of near-term ACV, but it is an indication of where our thought leadership is and where our influence is in kind of being forward thinking about how the future of R&D can look. Yes. I mean what I would say is, just as a reminder, where we - where our business is placed is really in the R&D space, right? So the question you're answering about kind of decoupling and moving is a complex answer, because the - it's a complex question to answer, because it really relies upon an understanding of what is the nature of what actually happens in that decoupling. If it's lift and shift of manufacturing than it isn't as exposed to the R&D cycle as fundamentally changing the way R&D works or changing the innovation model or the way the process of R&D works which would be more amenable to where the role of simulation plays, because we\u2026 Yes. So that - I mean, so that's the - yes, so what I would say is that it is too early to tell, because the R&D is - the decoupling is really a mixed dynamic around shifting manufacturing and where customers are still in the early process of thinking about what that looks like and what it changes, right? So, I would say that there isn't anything definitive to point to at this moment, but that is the framework for how I would think about, where it would impact our business and where it wouldn't impact our business. Yes. So first, I'll start off by saying that the overall dynamics in the quarter that we saw from a geography mix standpoint, from a deal mix standpoint, are very much in line with what we expected when we initiated guidance. So, there's nothing that was surprising or that changed in the quarter that is different from the outcome. And when you look at Americas overall, Americas has led the company in creating value for customers, and we continue to expect it to be - it's our largest region. We continue to expect it to be a strong performer and revenue growth in the quarter was 12% in constant currency. We highlighted in the prepared remarks, some emblematic large deals that we had in the quarter. So, the quarterly dynamics around what we delivered in Americas was in line with the expectations we had. And then in the geographic mix overall, we're really pleased with the performance that we saw in Asia Pacific and EMEA as well, as we pointed out in our prepared remarks. And we had pretty diversified industry dynamics and growth in APAC as an example, aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial equipment performed really well. When you look at EMEA, we had similar kind of broad industry growth, automotive and ground transportation, A&D and industrial equipment were all strong. Materials and Chemicals were also particularly strong. So we saw a quarter in Q2 very much in the way in which we envisioned it would play out. And it actually ended up being a little bit better which allowed us to beat the midpoint of our guidance in the quarter. And the dynamics in the building pipeline that we've seen across the globe, across industries, geographies, customer segments is what gave us the confidence to raise the full year ACV by 0.5 point, which is in excess of the beat that we had in Q2. Yes. And as Ajei said, I mean this was - this is an amazing technology, great IP really talented team, it was not in an advanced commercial phase. So there's no material impact from this particular acquisition in the quarter or in the second half outlook. Yes, sure. So as I've noted in the past, we haven't had a quarter that has this much disconnection in a couple of quarters in quite a while. But sometimes you have a quarter where you can have a meaningful disconnect between the P&L and ACV. So again, if you look at the underlying ACV growth in the quarter and in the half, it is accelerating both from the first half and throughout Q3 and Q4. And so the overall dynamics around ECB, which is the basis of cash generation are very consistent. Now in the quarter, the mix of license types which generate upfront recognition within the Q3 outlook, is relatively lower in 2022 versus 2023. So that's what's creating the year-over-year headwind in the quarter and that's what's causing the disconnect between the P&L in the quarter from the strong and accelerating third quarter and second half ACV outlook. Now when you look that year-over-year revenue and the resulting P&L in the third quarter, as we said, it's not a reflection of momentum or any change in the business. And when you - if you consider the full year guidance and the Q3 guidance, and you can evaluate the implied Q4 revenue growth, you can see that, that outlook returns to strong double-digit growth. And so that's the reason why we've - our full year ACV guidance is really the best metric to observe momentum in our business. And that's where we've seen kind of the continued progress and momentum. The increased just under 1.5 points since February of our outlook in ACV with - when you add this additional half point that we gave. So that's the underlying dynamic that's driving the disconnect between the quarter and the - I'm sorry, the quarter and the full year. Yes. So there's really nothing operational because the pipeline is the pipeline and the mix of kind of license types that renew are those that were new. So there's nothing really operational. But on occasion, you can get the comparison of a high mix of upfront of license types that have upfront recognition like perpetual licenses or multiyear leases compared to a different period where you have a relatively different mix, a higher mix of one-year leases as an example, right? So you can have a different mix in a comparative period, which drives anomalies in growth rates but it doesn't fundamentally change the overall dynamics in the business. In fact, if you look at the overall SKU of the business and the implied SKU of what we're delivering kind of implied in the guidance in the second half of the year, it is very consistent with what has been done in prior quarters. It's just that the revenue recognition rules can tend to have some really odd comparative dynamics when you have the comparative of license types mix in one period versus the comparison in another period. And so that's a dynamic that is sometimes challenging. It hasn't happened in a couple of quarters, but every once in a while, you have a quarter where you have just a very different dynamic on a quarter-to-quarter - year-over-year basis within a quarter."

Q1 was an outstanding quarter for ANSYS with the company once again surpassing expectations across all key metrics. We grew ACV by 19% in constant currency over Q1 2022, which reflects the power of our world-class products, the ongoing demand from our customers and the strength of our business. As a result of our strong Q1, we have operationally raised our full year guidance for ACV revenue and EPS. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. ANSYS realized broad-based growth across the business in Q1. We grew revenue by double-digits in every region in the quarter with the Americas leading the way. From a vertical perspective the high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top contributors. Our largest agreement in the quarter was a nearly $74 million three-year contract with a multinational aerospace and defense technology company based in the US We grew the account by showcasing the value ANSYS is driven at this long-time customer including a new workflow with our digital mission engineering and electromagnetic solutions that reduce the time required to bring a critical product to market by 50%. That same workflow is being reused by multiple groups within the company helping to drive more users, more products and more computations. On these calls, I often highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several quarters, I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I highlighted how customers are using our solutions in the development of next-generation semiconductor and I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. For this call, I would like to give you additional insight into the innovation we are driving across our multiphysics portfolio through an easy-to-understand taxonomy of five technology pillars. Our investments in these pillars are applicable across our portfolio and demonstrate how we are building upon our product and technology leadership to further differentiate our solutions. Even more exciting is the interplay amongst these pillars, which is benefiting customers by helping them to solve more complex challenges, while driving our growth through more products, more users and more computations. As you know ANSYS is the leader in advanced numerical simulation methods that accurately predict the multiphysics behavior of engineered products. Our continued investment across our core multiphysics products is reflected in our first technology pillar, which is numerics. Accurately predicting physical phenomena in the real world, is intrinsically complicated. The numerics pillar encompasses the latest advances in science, mathematics and analytics, which help us gain a deeper understanding of the physical world. It is the essence, of what we do at ANSYS with our core products. Over the last several releases, we have further differentiated our products with advanced numerics capabilities. Let me give you just, a few examples. In ANSYS Mechanical, new functionality enables customers to automatically predict structural crack initiation and growth without the need for expert knowledge. In ANSYS HFSS, our leading electromagnetic solution users can now solve increasingly complicated problems by creating simulations 8 times larger than before. And in CFD, our fluids blade row analysis, enables customers to automatically mesh complex blade features while retaining the efficient Hex measures, that turbomachinery engineers demand. In Q1, we signed a new contract with a long-time customer INNIO, which uses advanced numerics capabilities from ANSYS to develop engines that run on a broad range of energy sources including hydrogen and biomethane. INNIO is expanding its usage of ANSYS multiphysics solutions, including structures and fluids, to accelerate time to market and to increase engine efficiency and performance. Our second technology pillar is high-performance computing or HPC, which is enabling customers to solve problems they couldn't solve otherwise, and to do so faster than anyone thought possible. ANSYS has close partnerships with hyperscale computer partners, and has long taken advantage of distributed memory, multiprocessing and multiple cores to accelerate our customers' products to market, and in the process drive more computations. Again, I could cite numerous examples of new HPC technologies, in our solutions. But in the interest of time, here are just a few. In ANSYS Mechanical, technologies such as hybrid parallel, which blends distributor and shared memory parallel programming techniques, enables simulations to scale to tens of thousands of compute cores. A new multi-GPU solver, empowers users to run ANSYS Fluent natively on multiple GPUs. This CFD solution, which we believe is the first general-purpose CFD solver for GPUs is 7 times less expensive in hardware purchase costs and consumes 4 times less power than an equivalent CPU solution. In Q1, we signed a contract with the International Technology Group, Andritz, which offers a broad portfolio of innovative, power plants, equipment, systems, services and digital solutions for a wide range of industries and end markets. As part of this agreement, Andritz is leveraging HPC to more rapidly solve complex structural and fluid simulations, to increase the efficiency of its turbines. As a result, Andritz is reducing the amount of physical testing needed to deliver its products to market. The next area of technology emphasis, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI is not restricted to a specific ANSYS product line. Instead, it is architectured across our portfolio to improve ease of use, to accelerate time to solve and to further democratize simulation. Let me start with the use of AI to accelerate the time required to complete the simulation. You might recall, that a single large complex simulation, can run for days across hundreds of cores. We are incorporating AI techniques directly into multiple products, to increase the speed and scale of a single simulation. For example, our real-time radar functionality enhances HFSS, is being used to train machine learning algorithms, for radar systems in cluttered environments with moving targets. Combining synthetic radar responses with machine learning, has resulted in a 1,000x speed up, compared to previous methods and has opened the door to exciting new opportunities, for automotive radar and autonomy. Artificial intelligence can also address the multiple iterative simulations needed to get to an optimal design point. Often customers use ANSYS products to run complex multi-variant optimizations, where they vary design parameters and boundary conditions over multiple simulation runs to reach the best design. Such multiple intrusive runs can be time-consuming due to the number of simulations that need to be performed. To address this issue, our optimization engine ANSYS optiSLang uses AI techniques to reduce the time it takes to intuitively run thousands of simulations for products across the ANSYS portfolio. For example, one customer designing electric motors initially needed seven hours to run an ANSYS-Motor CAD multivariate optimization with 4800 simulations. But with the AI techniques in optiSLang, they solve the same problem in an astonishing 17 minutes. Our fourth technology pillar is cloud and experience. We have made some recent announcements about our cloud marketplace offerings and we are continuing to invest in cloud native capabilities as well as user experience. ANSYS offers two distinct kinds of cloud offerings. The first is Cloud Marketplace and the second is cloud native. And this combination of marketplace and native takes full advantage of past innovations as well as some of our newly announced cloud capabilities. The marketplace offerings deliver flexibility to our customers by taking advantage of familiar ANSYS products, while leveraging the benefit of cloud computing and their own pre-existing relationships with cloud service providers. ANSYS has announced partnerships with key cloud providers AWS and Microsoft Azure. In quick, Q1, a developer of sustainability technologies for buildings and electric vehicles began using ANSYS Max well on the cloud thanks to ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS. Using this cloud-powered solution the customer is optimizing the electromagnetics of its smart motor design via cloud bursting on several independent workstations. Users can spin up a cluster in minutes and add remote users from satellite locations to improve overall agility and speed proof-of-concept. The company's engineers are simultaneously running 125,000 simulations and analyzing design seven times faster, thanks to the solution. On the cloud native space, we are targeting new users and new use cases with a cloud-based platform for the development and deployment of new workflows and applications. While cloud native simulation is still early in the maturity cycle, we are continuing to advance this exciting technology. The final technology pillar empowers customers to optimize product designs to meet physical and behavioral requirements throughout the engineering design life cycle, thanks to digital engineering. Digital engineering relates to a set of connected federated and interoperable technologies that enable the collaborative execution of engineering tasks. Today, the vast majority of time and money spent on R&D goes towards failure mode avoidance. Digital engineering enables a more rigorous R&D process based on model-based engineering, system-level simulation and an agile iterative methodology that results in improved product quality and faster throughput with reduce costs. The latest release of ANSYS Minerva improves engineering productivity with efficient stimulation process and data management, while connecting powerful simulation and optimization solutions to an existing ecosystem of tools and processes. And ANSYs SCADE users can employ model-based systems engineering methods to design and generate reliable embedded software. As you might expect, this pillar is driving more users and more products. In Q1, we signed an agreement with a global automotive OEM that is expanding its use of ANSYS products to include additional electronics and model-based system engineering technologies. By taking advantage of these solutions, the automaker can enforce architecture from existing models, allowing for reuse and traceability of parts. The automaker has reported that the use of ANSYS simulation has decreased product development time by month, which is helping the company to keep pace with increasing customer demands. Our investments across these five technology pillars: Numerics, HBC, AI/ML, Cloud and Experience and digital engineering are critical for our ongoing successes. Even more important is the interplay amongst them, which is fueling ANSYS' growth and widening our product leadership across the board. Our customers across industries are benefiting from many of these advances today, which is helping them to deliver their own innovations to market. Moving to our partner ecosystem. We recently announced a collaboration with Synopsys and Keysight Technologies, in which we developed a radio frequency design reference flow for TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET compact technology. TSMC's technology is critical for advanced autonomous systems including automotive radar, 5G connectivity, security applications and environmental monitors. We also recently announced that ANSYS is expanding our university partnerships to train the next generation of engineers through a funded curriculum program. We are financially supporting educators to help them develop undergraduate engineering curricula at universities around the world. ANSYS is already being taught at more than 3,000 universities across nearly 90 countries and there have been more than 2.75 million downloads of our free student product. In Q1, we published the updated version of our corporate responsibility report. In it, we discussed the progress we have made against our ESG goals. Additionally, ANSYS has developed a focused strategy to support our customers' sustainability objectives with a particular emphasis on clean environment, materials and circularity, energy solutions and manufacturing and operational efficiency. Finally, I'm excited to announce that ANSYS has again been certified as a most loved workplace. This certification recognizes great workplaces based on employee surveys that gauge levels of respect, collaboration, support and a sense of belonging. In summary, Q1 was an outstanding quarter that has set the stage for the rest of 2023. As we have demonstrated by again beating guidance across all key metrics, our end markets remain robust and our business has proven its resilience, despite some economic uncertainties. Customers understand our compelling value proposition, which is driving their top line growth and delivering bottom line savings. Our continued momentum, the strong customer relationships, we have consistently demonstrated and our ongoing investments in technology will propel us through 2023 and beyond. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve future milestones. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole?\nNicole Anasenes: Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2023. The first quarter demonstrated the strength of our business, as we delivered robust growth during Q1, and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV exceeded expectations and beat the high-end of our Q1 guidance in constant currency. Revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Given the strength of demand for simulation and the momentum we see in our pipeline, we are operationally raising our full year ACV revenue and EPS. Operational improvements in our full year ACV outlook, is above and beyond our Q1 outperformance. I'll provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now, let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $399.4 million in Q1, which grew 16% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in the quarter, with growth seen across geographic regions, customer types and industries. Our wide ranging growth is evidence of the essential nature of our market-leading simulation portfolio. ACV from recurring sources grew 12% or 18% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 82% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift to subscription leases. Q1 total revenue was $509.4 million and grew 19% or 22% in constant currency, which as I mentioned exceeded the high-end of our guidance, driven by the favorable mix of license types in the quarter. All geographic regions grew double-digits and contributed to revenue growth with the Americas leading the way. We had strong top line performance in Q1 with ACV and revenue, both growing double-digit in constant currency at 19% and 22% respectively. During the quarter, we delivered growth in excess of our model of double-digit growth including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.4 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 91.2% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue, the favorable mix of license types as well as the timing of investments. The results with first quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2023. Our unlevered operating cash flows in the first quarter totaled $269.5 million and grew 26.5% year-over-year, which benefited from strong collections. We ended the quarter with $507.9 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 650,000 shares during the quarter for around $196.5 million. We have 1.1 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We delivered an outstanding first quarter coming off an exceptional Q4 2022 and our updated 2023 forecast reflects the continued broad-based customer demand for a market-leading simulation portfolio. Looking to the remainder of the year, the pipeline of business has improved and continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. However, offsetting our improved full year outlook is further strengthening of the US dollar against certain currencies particularly the Japanese Yen and Korean Yuan, relative to the exchange rates that were embedded in the outlook we provided in February. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business continues to demonstrate considerable momentum. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $2.265 billion to $2.335 billion, which represents growth of 11.5% to 14.9% or 10.8% to 14.2% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance in constant currency growth by approximately 1-point. That constant currency increase is driven by robust demand and translates to an operational increase of $16 million relative to our short February guidance. Our improved outlook is in excess of the Q1 overperformance we delivered relative to our Q1 guidance. This operational momentum was fully offset by $16 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.242 billion to $2.322 billion, which is growth of 8.2% to 12% or 7.7% to 11.6% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth. Relative to our February guidance, our full year revenue increased $15 million from operational performance, which was fully offset by $15 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.39 to $8.91 which represents an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint. Relative to our February guidance, our full year EPS increased by about $0.18 from better operational performance lower share count and higher interest income estimates, which was partially offset by absorbing $0.13 of foreign exchange headwind. Now, let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update in August. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $699 million to $749 million. Relative to our February guidance, our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance is adversely impacted by $11 million of foreign exchange headwinds. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Despite the foreign exchange headwinds that have emerged since our February guidance, our current outlook of 8% to 16% unlevered operating cash flow growth building off 16% growth in 2022 demonstrates cumulative cash flow which exceed the ACV growth. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now, let me turn to guidance for Q2. For the second quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $474 million to $494 million. Seasonal SKU of our renewal base that is unique to 2023 is driving a relatively more muted Q2 dynamic. However, as I've mentioned in the past quarterly dynamics can be volatile. For the first half of 2023, we expect to deliver strong double-digit growth. Our full year ACV outlook implies growth above our model in the second half of 2023 and is supported by a robust pipeline and a strong base of renewals that underpin that ACV growth. The first half second half dynamics embedded in our guidance are playing out as we expected when we initiated guidance in February. Turning to the P&L. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $473 million to $498 million. We expect Q2 operating margin in the range of 31.9% to 34.1% and EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.53. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q2 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast a highly recurring business model with three vectors of growth and a healthy backlog and pipeline all of which contributed to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum of our business. This is reflected in the operationally increased outlook for ACV revenue and EPS. I would like to thank the entire ANSYS team for their outstanding execution in the first quarter, which drove robust financial performance and a strong start to 2023. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with the improvements in our sales forecast demonstrate the strength and resilience of the ANSYS business. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you. Good morning. Ajei, let me start first with your comments regarding multi-solution sales. And you -- on occasion given the statistic as to the contribution of the number or -- of those transactions? And within that are there any notable mix trends that you're seeing with regard to the contribution of various types of solvers for example is CFD growing in particular industries relative to solver mix or electronics perhaps within certain industries becoming as material as structural or CFD or others. So I think if you could comment on some of those solver mix trends, I think that would be interesting on a per-industry basis. My follow-up question is with regard to your comments on the partner ecosystem. If you could speak more broadly about that, within engineering software ANSYS has an unusual number of such relationships. So it would be very interesting to hear, if you could comment on the materiality individually or collectively of those relationships, or how you think about that ecosystem relative to guidance in terms of your, relationships with companies like Synopsys, Altair et cetera. Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: So Jay to answer there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions embedded in there, so let me try to do some justice to a couple of them perhaps. So when you think about the large sales so customers who have purchased more than $1 million or so in the quarter, I would say over 90%, have three or more physics and purchased three or more physics from ANSYS. And so that gives you some perspective of the strength of the multiphysics capabilities that we are able to bring to bear. As far as our products are concerned, obviously the strength of our flagship products is legendary. I mean everybody understands that we have a terrific product in the space. But what we've also seen is the interplay between products and the multiphysics nature of the portfolio I think coming through. So that's also been really helpful. And obviously the advances that we've made that I've talked about in electromagnetics, in CFD and structures et cetera across the portfolio in Optics, all of those advances we've made across those five vectors of technology that I talked about are all helpful and important in the way that we engage with our customers and in the value that they see from our products. So I'm feeling very good about our product portfolio. I'm feeling very good about our multiphysics strategy and our ability to service our customers. With respect to our partnership ecosystem maybe it's best to step back and talk a little bit about the philosophy. Look, we believe in an open ecosystem. I think it's very important for us for our customers to recognize that the vendors that they're working with are participating in the open ecosystem which means providing APIs, which means providing for interoperability and things of that nature. And so we are committed to that. We are working obviously with multiple -- other vendors to make sure that customers can benefit from technologies. And obviously no single customer is going to be completely dedicated to a single-vendor. They're going to have technologies from multiple-vendors. We want to make sure that that works for our customers. And so our partnership strategy is driven by that belief in an open ecosystem and the ability to work collaboratively to support customer needs.\nJay Vleeschhouwer: Thank you.\nAjei Gopal: Thanks Jay.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Celino of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJason Celino: Great. Thank you. Ajei, you mentioned cloud native the strategy is targeting new users and new use cases. Can you just talk about the SAM extension a little bit? Is it about moving down or earlier in the design cycle or down market? Thanks.\nAjei Gopal: Yeah. So as far as moving earlier or sort of the democratization of simulation there are a number of things that we've been doing and I think that's continues to be important in our strategy. Number one is making our technology more accessible easier to use. We have certainly advances with respect to our discovery product portfolio. We continue to try to make the technology more accessible to less experienced engineers. Some of the -- if you -- I talked about some of the advances that we've made on technology on things like numerics and other areas of physics. We're democratizing simulation by really expanding the use case of problems think about problems that we can solve today that couldn't be solved earlier in a reasonable amount of time. The investments that we're making are allowing customers to take advantage of this advanced simulation capability and we see that as a form of democratization and certainly the investments that we're making across the GPUs, as well makes technology easier. There's some really interesting work that we're doing with AI/ML to help democratize simulation. As you know simulation can be difficult to set up and take an example of setting up something like a turbulent flow can be quite complex. And we're using AI/ML techniques, for example, to help democratize that and make that easy for end users to set up fluent simulations. And I could go on and on. With respect to cloud, obviously, accessing simulation on the cloud opens the door to smaller customers who may not necessarily have access to high-speed computing. That's certainly democratizing simulation and our continued investments in APIs I think also makes that easier for customers to build automation or special purpose applications on top of simulation. All of this in the aggregate extends the reach of simulation into areas where it wasn't being used before.\nJason Celino: Okay. Interesting. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, really strong Q1 ACV. I know you mentioned for Q2 some renewal dynamics, but I thought I'd just double check. Was anything closed earlier in Q1? Thanks.\nNicole Anasenes: Yeah, Jason, thanks for the question. Yeah, the business is playing out as we expected at the start of the year. Our Q2 renewal dynamic is something that was considered in our full year guidance when we initiated in February. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a structural dynamic -- timing dynamic in our renewal base for Q2 and that happens from time to time. But quarterly dynamics as we've always said can be really volatile and are not representative of momentum in the business. But what has changed since we initiated guidance in Q1 was as you point out we had a great Q1 where we not only grew 19% in constant currency, but we beat the midpoint of our guidance. And in addition to that our constant currency outlook for the quarter has improved. Our view of ACV growth before the impact of foreign exchange, which we talked about in the prepared remarks it's increased based on the development of our pipeline since initiating guidance in February. It's also underwritten by a highly recurring ACV model with over 80% of our ACV is recurring and a very strong base of renewals that we see in the second half. So if we step aside from the volatility quarters can have and you look at the implied ranges in our guidance, our guidance range implies double-digit constant currency growth for the first half and growth above our model of 12% in the second half again underwritten by that very strong renewal base, resulting in a 12.5% constant currency growth outlook at the midpoint, which is almost one point above the midpoint we indicated in February. So we feel really good about where we landed in Q1 after a really strong Q4 and strong 2022. And the guidance that we gave reflects the continued and improved optimism that we have overall in the business, notwithstanding, structural dynamics that sometimes happen in quarters, which introduced volatility. And that's why we are always focused on the full year and how we progress our view of the full year.\nJason Celino: Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answer. Thank you.\nNicole Anasenes: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nAjei Gopal: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: Just a follow-up on that question. You mentioned the structural dynamics. Can you maybe just delve into that a little more? That just sounds like it's some timing from that perspective? And then secondly just on the remarks there were a few less seven and eight-figure deals mentioned in the remarks than last quarter in particular. Anything to read into there as far as the size of the deals that you're booking this quarter?\nNicole Anasenes: Sure. So let me start with the first -- your first question. And then will go to the second. So in terms of the renewal base, the timing of customer renewals happen at natural cycles within the quarter. And as we have been moving to the strategic selling motion and bringing individual, kind of, development teams projects, in a customer to more strategic multiyear lease arrangements, sometimes the timing of renewals can shift on a year-to-year basis over time, right, which is the reason why we're very focused on the full year dynamic, because we take deals when they naturally occur because it optimizes the outcome for our customers, and it optimizes the outcome for ANSYS, which ultimately optimizes the outcome for investors. And so, the dynamic around the quarter is just something that happens from time to time. We had very, very strong Q1. The first half, is still strong in double digits. So we're feeling really good about where we're at, and there's nothing about Q2 that wasn't contemplated or seen or known when we started the year. As it relates to fewer 7- and 8-figure deals, I would say, the underlying dynamic around our large deal progression is not unchanged from any other prior Q1s. As you know, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter, you tend to have a lot more closing in the quarter. And so on a relative basis, there may be more mentions. But the underlying dynamics, around the strength of the pipeline, around the ability to drive strategic relationships, and larger deals with our customers customers' willingness to engage, customers willingness to close. None of those aspects have changed since we spoke in February, about how the shape of the business is progressing. \nSteve Tusa: That makes a ton of sense. And then just one more longer-term follow-up Ajei, I'm probably not the smartest tech guy on this call for sure, but obviously, AI/ML HPC all this stuff just seems to be pretty incredible and moving at a very fast pace. When do you think that inflection can tangibly influence your growth rate? I know you guys, have kind of a 10-year view on this stuff. But I mean, it seems like with the acceleration in these technologies that may be it is, pulling forward that impact to your growth, perhaps from several years from now, to maybe I don't know 18 24 months? I mean, is it that visible of a growth driver, given the progression that's happening and how accelerated it's been? \nAjei Gopal: Well, Steve, I think one of the important things to recognize is, we've been investing in these technologies for a while. And so one of the reasons why, I wanted to take the time during the call, to go through them is, because there's just -- because of exactly the dynamic you mentioned. There appears -- there is a lot of activity in the marketplace and certainly people are aware of advances in technologies, and it's an area where there's been a lot of discussion. But if you think of areas like numeric, as an example, that's been the bread and butter of ANSYS. That's really understanding the mathematics, and the engineering, and the science around being able to appreciate and predict physical phenomena, and that is applicable of course across our portfolio. The HPC activity is certainly been included within our business, for a while. And if you think about the vectors of growth that we talked about in our Investor Day last year, we talked about more users. We talked about more products, and we talked about more computations. And the more computations vector is being driven by high-performance computing, and the desire for customers to solve larger and larger problems, which are solvable as you start to introduce additional cores, you starting to use GPUs and other architectures. So AI/ML is obviously, an area where we've been investing, as I said, for a while. And we have products in the market today, that are taking advantage of AI ML capabilities. So these are all technologies and I don't want to repeat what I said on the call, but these are all technologies and areas where there continues to be investment in -- within ANSYS, of course, across the industry and we continue to reap the benefit within our products to benefit our customers. \nSteve Tusa: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question is from Ken Wong of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nKen Wong: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Nicole, just back on the 2Q ACV, I realize you're maybe beating the dead horse here, but I think kind of the one kind of consistent question, we're getting from investors is, just making sure that this has nothing to do with extended sales cycles or potentially smaller deal size commitments. The structure of those particular KPIs are consistent with, what you're seeing in past quarters? \nNicole Anasenes: Yes. That's absolutely, the case. I mean this is just about an over -- and you -- I know have been have been with us quite a while. You've seen quarters go up and down based on these renewal dynamics which is again why we focus on the full year. So there's nothing about the underlying dynamics in Q2 that are indicative of anything other than an underlying renewal base that has a SKU within the year that is driving those dynamics.\nKen Wong: Got it. Perfect. Perfect. And then maybe just wanted to check on direct versus SMB. I mean with all the kind of disruption in our banking system right now, I was always a little concerned that maybe SMBs will have a harder time getting financing. Any changes in terms of what you're seeing on the lower end of the market? \nNicole Anasenes: No. I mean the underlying dynamics across all of our different customer segments have been performing pretty consistently as we've seen in prior Q1s. We had a lot of strength of course in the enterprise segment with the larger deals that we did this year and really strong in the Americas. But I would say we had strong growth across all three customer segments consistent with what we've had in the past.\nKen Wong: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Adam Borg of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMike Richards: Hey, good morning. This is Mike Richards on for Adam Borg. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could talk about linearity in the quarter and how that's shaping up so far in the second quarter. Thanks.\nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean I would say overall revenue linearity was somewhat \u2013 was pretty similar to what it was last year. It was slightly more skewed to the third month but it was pretty much in line overall.\nMike Richards: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Joe Vruwink with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoe Vruwink: Hi, everyone. Ajei just going back to your earlier discussion on democratizing simulation. I think to this point a lot of people think of Discovery when you say that and moving ANSYS into design and early stage development. Do the AI capabilities you've embedded with the high-end solvers begin to remove any sorts of bands or ceilings you maybe once associated with just the addressable users of an upper end products? \nAjei Gopal: So when you think about the AI capabilities that we've got, we're using AI in multiple areas. And one area that I mentioned of course is making it easier for people to use products. And I gave you example of Fluent earlier in what \u2013 in response to one of the questions. That's a great example of making the technology, making our flagships easier to use. Discovery is also making the technologies easier to use in a more in a more broad-based manner. The use of AI/ML is very targeted within the portfolio. But another direction that we're going and we talked about this in our investor meeting or Investor Day last year was our ability to start to support applications. And so one of the ways in which we can democratize simulation is not \u2013 is allowing users to take advantage of applications, purpose-built applications for their needs that are built \u2013 that take advantage of simulation. And to that end we've created a set of APIs based on Python which allow people to build applications workflows things of that nature that further democratize simulation. So we're taking multiple routes to be able to make that happen. And in each of the directions we're addressing a different opportunity to be able to broaden the use case of a simulation.\nJoe Vruwink: And then maybe just as a follow-up and related to your last comment when you have customers, end users creating purpose-built applications, this really gets into I would imagine more domain expertise aligned within high tech, within Aerospace and Defense, within Auto. Do you think this is kind of the conduit for of course, bigger deals more strategic deals that's already been happening but does this kind of unlock a second wave of that phenomenon? \nAjei Gopal: Well certainly, the fact that we have the ability for people to write these automations or extensions taking advantage of the power of our portfolio using Python, where they can use other routines open source other things that are outside of simulation to bring that into a sort of an overall workflow. That is something that has helped us \u2013 that's helping us today. I mean there are examples of customers who have increased their use of ANSYS technologies because they've been able to build a very integrated workflow on top of this technology that allows more users to take advantage of what was previously restricted to a relatively small number of users. So that phenomenon that you're saying of driving incremental opportunity within our portfolio is absolutely the case. Furthermore, we would imagine outside of our outside of -- even outside of the engineering use case you could imagine long-term and this is a long-term statement, you can imagine other applications targeting others who are looking for the insights of physics-based simulation to be delivered to them. And we've talked about -- and certainly last year we talked about a healthcare example where someone delivering medical care or surgeon delivering medical care uses an application, which is built for that surgeon. It has nothing to do -- as far as their concern nothing to do with physics per se. They're all about delivering the care that they need to deliver. But underneath simulation is being done to influence the directions that they go. So those are examples of next-generation applications, which we believe will happen in the long-term but that's not a short-term impact. And so as we build out our capabilities we believe that we're enabling both the short-term opportunity as well as the long-term opportunity, which we've been calling the notion of being able to get pervasive insight. \nJoe Vruwink: Thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question is from Blair Abernethy of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. \nBlair Abernethy: Thank you. Ajei just wondering if you could drill in a little bit for us on the aerospace and defense vertical $74 million deal there. That's great. And I just wanted to see -- what are you seeing in the defense side in particular given what's been happening in the last 12 months? And any shift in buying patterns in that market? \nAjei Gopal: Well, I mean, obviously A&D continues to be one of our top industries. And our aerospace customers are facing complex challenges things like engine width design lightweighting those continue to be areas of investment for our customers, but also a lot of work on Space 2.0 and the ability to be able to launch payloads into space. That's another area where there continues to be a lot of interest. Obviously, commercial air is recovering post pandemic there continues to be more interest. And then of course from a defense perspective there's obviously a global perspective. You're seeing this certainly in the United States. You're seeing this as you see increased spending in Germany, for example. So all of that represents long-term tailwinds into the aerospace and defense industries. And we certainly are very well-positioned given the nature of our technologies to be able to take advantage of that. \nBlair Abernethy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Tilton of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nJosh Tilton: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my first one. My first one is an easy one. What was the contribution of DYNAmore to ACV in the quarter? \nNicole Anasenes: Yes. So we had spoken about DYNAmore for the full year as being about \u20ac30 million to \u20ac35 million with about half of it being in Q1 in our February call. And you can -- the underlying assumption you can make is that we're pretty in line with what we expected in February. \nJosh Tilton: Perfect. Thank you. And then, I guess, my follow-up is. I totally understand that the first half, second half dynamics are kind of playing out as you expected when you first gave guidance in the beginning of the year. But I guess, my question is the world has kind of changed since then? And is there anything you can give us maybe from your conversations with customers that's just increasing your confidence that some of these second half renewals won't get pushed out if the macro continues to deteriorate? \nNicole Anasenes: Yes. I mean -- so here's the pragmatic answer to that is, if customers don't renew they lose access to the software and they can't build their products. And so the renewal base is very, very sticky because it affects their R&D cycles. And so -- and just to kind of take it a step back and to contextualize kind of, where we sit in the corporate decision-making process and what has happened in other kind of economic events. Simulation tends to be the last thing that gets shutoff and the first thing that gets turned back on. And that's because it is connected to people's R&D. And R&D tends to be -- the investments in R&D tend to be longer -- long-term views as opposed to short-term tactics. So that's one. The second is, even within the R&D process the areas that are most susceptible would be areas that are connected to seat counts and people and that's not how the economics of our software work. So our software is -- the way customers use our software is based on the capacity of compute that they need and the software that they need to run their simulations within their R&D cycle. And so, if there are underlying changes in the footprint of the R&D part of the business, it doesn't really affect our part of the software stack in the R&D cycle. And the last part is, simulation actually can provide tailwinds for -- and support the underlying cost efficiencies of our customers in their R&D cycle. Using simulation reduces the need for physical prototyping. It shortens the innovation cycle. You can have a single analyst run multiple simulations at the same time. And so, the throughput that you get and the efficiency that you get from using simulation to build products, has a very high ROI. And in times where you're looking to transform simulation is valuable, not just in accelerating time to value to accelerate the top line, but also to support running R&D in a more efficient manner. And so, those are the underlying qualitative dynamics, but the real answer on the renewal base is that, it's very, very sticky and a small short-term disruption in economic outlook has historically not had an impact on our overall business.\nAjei Gopal: Yes. And just to amplify what Nicole said and to add a little bit more color as well. We're not tied to the number of units produced, right? So, if you cut back on production for whatever reason, your R&D efforts still continue, because you're building for the long term. And if you look at all of the industries that we serve, there are major transformations that are taking place in each of the industries and the long-term competitiveness of organizations is at stake. So if you're in the automotive industry, for example, electrification is front and center, autonomy is front and center. And stepping back from any of these activities will result in a long-term degradation of their business and no one wants to go to it. And so, what we're seeing and what we saw in the past, we saw this when we had this -- when Lehman went out of business back in the day, we saw that R&D was the last that was cut and we saw that it was the first thing that was restored. And the lesson that was learned after that and there were reports and the there were -- there was a lot of post-mortem done after that. But the lessons that we've learned is that the organizations that continue to invest in R&D were the ones that came out of that downturn and were successful afterwards. And so you see when we talk to customers, our value proposition is not just about accelerating R&D as I described. But our value proposition as Nicole said is also about being able to help cost. And we have well estab chapter inverse we can talk about how we can reduce warranty costs, how we can make engineers more efficient. We can talk about how we can reduce the amount of raw materials that have been used for experimentation purposes. They move away from physical prototyping. So that is a very hard ROI that we can make and we can make that case. Now I've spent -- I've talked to our sales leaders around the world. I've talked to customers around the world. And I'm only getting -- I'm getting strong support for our -- for the guidance that we've given you. We're seeing the markets -- the customers are committed. We're seeing that the nature of the technology that we provide is critical and we see our negotiations and discussions with customers kind of going as we expect. We call it as we see it. We're not trying to come up with sort of speculation of what the markets might look like. We just call it as we see it. We can give you a perspective on where our customers are how they're buying and all of that is reflected within -- all that is reflected within our within the way that we're guiding. So we feel great about the guidance we've given you. We feel great about the second half of the year. We feel great about Q2. And as Nicole has said several times on this call, there is an underlying dynamic of our -- the renewals of our business. And for those of you who have been following our company for multiple years that underlying dynamic is exactly something that we've seen year after year after year. And we've always had quarters which are stronger in quarters which are relatively weaker in that context of the overall full year and so we manage to the full year. And that's important for us and we feel really good about where we are right now. \nJosh Tilton: Super helpful. Really appreciate the thoughts and response.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.\nAjei Gopal: I'm excited about our outstanding start to 2023. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success. Our superior technology, our broad-based business momentum and our strong customer relationships give us even greater confidence in our ability to execute against long-term goals. Thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ajei Gopal",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an outstanding quarter for ANSYS with the company once again surpassing expectations across all key metrics. We grew ACV by 19% in constant currency over Q1 2022, which reflects the power of our world-class products, the ongoing demand from our customers and the strength of our business. As a result of our strong Q1, we have operationally raised our full year guidance for ACV revenue and EPS. Nicole will have the details in a few minutes. ANSYS realized broad-based growth across the business in Q1. We grew revenue by double-digits in every region in the quarter with the Americas leading the way. From a vertical perspective the high-tech and semiconductor, aerospace and defense, and automotive and ground transportation sectors were again our top contributors. Our largest agreement in the quarter was a nearly $74 million three-year contract with a multinational aerospace and defense technology company based in the US We grew the account by showcasing the value ANSYS is driven at this long-time customer including a new workflow with our digital mission engineering and electromagnetic solutions that reduce the time required to bring a critical product to market by 50%. That same workflow is being reused by multiple groups within the company helping to drive more users, more products and more computations. On these calls, I often highlight a specific aspect of our business. Over the past several quarters, I have discussed the critical role that ANSYS solutions play in sustainability. I highlighted how customers are using our solutions in the development of next-generation semiconductor and I reviewed our leading suite of optical simulation products. For this call, I would like to give you additional insight into the innovation we are driving across our multiphysics portfolio through an easy-to-understand taxonomy of five technology pillars. Our investments in these pillars are applicable across our portfolio and demonstrate how we are building upon our product and technology leadership to further differentiate our solutions. Even more exciting is the interplay amongst these pillars, which is benefiting customers by helping them to solve more complex challenges, while driving our growth through more products, more users and more computations. As you know ANSYS is the leader in advanced numerical simulation methods that accurately predict the multiphysics behavior of engineered products. Our continued investment across our core multiphysics products is reflected in our first technology pillar, which is numerics. Accurately predicting physical phenomena in the real world, is intrinsically complicated. The numerics pillar encompasses the latest advances in science, mathematics and analytics, which help us gain a deeper understanding of the physical world. It is the essence, of what we do at ANSYS with our core products. Over the last several releases, we have further differentiated our products with advanced numerics capabilities. Let me give you just, a few examples. In ANSYS Mechanical, new functionality enables customers to automatically predict structural crack initiation and growth without the need for expert knowledge. In ANSYS HFSS, our leading electromagnetic solution users can now solve increasingly complicated problems by creating simulations 8 times larger than before. And in CFD, our fluids blade row analysis, enables customers to automatically mesh complex blade features while retaining the efficient Hex measures, that turbomachinery engineers demand. In Q1, we signed a new contract with a long-time customer INNIO, which uses advanced numerics capabilities from ANSYS to develop engines that run on a broad range of energy sources including hydrogen and biomethane. INNIO is expanding its usage of ANSYS multiphysics solutions, including structures and fluids, to accelerate time to market and to increase engine efficiency and performance. Our second technology pillar is high-performance computing or HPC, which is enabling customers to solve problems they couldn't solve otherwise, and to do so faster than anyone thought possible. ANSYS has close partnerships with hyperscale computer partners, and has long taken advantage of distributed memory, multiprocessing and multiple cores to accelerate our customers' products to market, and in the process drive more computations. Again, I could cite numerous examples of new HPC technologies, in our solutions. But in the interest of time, here are just a few. In ANSYS Mechanical, technologies such as hybrid parallel, which blends distributor and shared memory parallel programming techniques, enables simulations to scale to tens of thousands of compute cores. A new multi-GPU solver, empowers users to run ANSYS Fluent natively on multiple GPUs. This CFD solution, which we believe is the first general-purpose CFD solver for GPUs is 7 times less expensive in hardware purchase costs and consumes 4 times less power than an equivalent CPU solution. In Q1, we signed a contract with the International Technology Group, Andritz, which offers a broad portfolio of innovative, power plants, equipment, systems, services and digital solutions for a wide range of industries and end markets. As part of this agreement, Andritz is leveraging HPC to more rapidly solve complex structural and fluid simulations, to increase the efficiency of its turbines. As a result, Andritz is reducing the amount of physical testing needed to deliver its products to market. The next area of technology emphasis, is artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI is not restricted to a specific ANSYS product line. Instead, it is architectured across our portfolio to improve ease of use, to accelerate time to solve and to further democratize simulation. Let me start with the use of AI to accelerate the time required to complete the simulation. You might recall, that a single large complex simulation, can run for days across hundreds of cores. We are incorporating AI techniques directly into multiple products, to increase the speed and scale of a single simulation. For example, our real-time radar functionality enhances HFSS, is being used to train machine learning algorithms, for radar systems in cluttered environments with moving targets. Combining synthetic radar responses with machine learning, has resulted in a 1,000x speed up, compared to previous methods and has opened the door to exciting new opportunities, for automotive radar and autonomy. Artificial intelligence can also address the multiple iterative simulations needed to get to an optimal design point. Often customers use ANSYS products to run complex multi-variant optimizations, where they vary design parameters and boundary conditions over multiple simulation runs to reach the best design. Such multiple intrusive runs can be time-consuming due to the number of simulations that need to be performed. To address this issue, our optimization engine ANSYS optiSLang uses AI techniques to reduce the time it takes to intuitively run thousands of simulations for products across the ANSYS portfolio. For example, one customer designing electric motors initially needed seven hours to run an ANSYS-Motor CAD multivariate optimization with 4800 simulations. But with the AI techniques in optiSLang, they solve the same problem in an astonishing 17 minutes. Our fourth technology pillar is cloud and experience. We have made some recent announcements about our cloud marketplace offerings and we are continuing to invest in cloud native capabilities as well as user experience. ANSYS offers two distinct kinds of cloud offerings. The first is Cloud Marketplace and the second is cloud native. And this combination of marketplace and native takes full advantage of past innovations as well as some of our newly announced cloud capabilities. The marketplace offerings deliver flexibility to our customers by taking advantage of familiar ANSYS products, while leveraging the benefit of cloud computing and their own pre-existing relationships with cloud service providers. ANSYS has announced partnerships with key cloud providers AWS and Microsoft Azure. In quick, Q1, a developer of sustainability technologies for buildings and electric vehicles began using ANSYS Max well on the cloud thanks to ANSYS Gateway powered by AWS. Using this cloud-powered solution the customer is optimizing the electromagnetics of its smart motor design via cloud bursting on several independent workstations. Users can spin up a cluster in minutes and add remote users from satellite locations to improve overall agility and speed proof-of-concept. The company's engineers are simultaneously running 125,000 simulations and analyzing design seven times faster, thanks to the solution. On the cloud native space, we are targeting new users and new use cases with a cloud-based platform for the development and deployment of new workflows and applications. While cloud native simulation is still early in the maturity cycle, we are continuing to advance this exciting technology. The final technology pillar empowers customers to optimize product designs to meet physical and behavioral requirements throughout the engineering design life cycle, thanks to digital engineering. Digital engineering relates to a set of connected federated and interoperable technologies that enable the collaborative execution of engineering tasks. Today, the vast majority of time and money spent on R&D goes towards failure mode avoidance. Digital engineering enables a more rigorous R&D process based on model-based engineering, system-level simulation and an agile iterative methodology that results in improved product quality and faster throughput with reduce costs. The latest release of ANSYS Minerva improves engineering productivity with efficient stimulation process and data management, while connecting powerful simulation and optimization solutions to an existing ecosystem of tools and processes. And ANSYs SCADE users can employ model-based systems engineering methods to design and generate reliable embedded software. As you might expect, this pillar is driving more users and more products. In Q1, we signed an agreement with a global automotive OEM that is expanding its use of ANSYS products to include additional electronics and model-based system engineering technologies. By taking advantage of these solutions, the automaker can enforce architecture from existing models, allowing for reuse and traceability of parts. The automaker has reported that the use of ANSYS simulation has decreased product development time by month, which is helping the company to keep pace with increasing customer demands. Our investments across these five technology pillars: Numerics, HBC, AI/ML, Cloud and Experience and digital engineering are critical for our ongoing successes. Even more important is the interplay amongst them, which is fueling ANSYS' growth and widening our product leadership across the board. Our customers across industries are benefiting from many of these advances today, which is helping them to deliver their own innovations to market. Moving to our partner ecosystem. We recently announced a collaboration with Synopsys and Keysight Technologies, in which we developed a radio frequency design reference flow for TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET compact technology. TSMC's technology is critical for advanced autonomous systems including automotive radar, 5G connectivity, security applications and environmental monitors. We also recently announced that ANSYS is expanding our university partnerships to train the next generation of engineers through a funded curriculum program. We are financially supporting educators to help them develop undergraduate engineering curricula at universities around the world. ANSYS is already being taught at more than 3,000 universities across nearly 90 countries and there have been more than 2.75 million downloads of our free student product. In Q1, we published the updated version of our corporate responsibility report. In it, we discussed the progress we have made against our ESG goals. Additionally, ANSYS has developed a focused strategy to support our customers' sustainability objectives with a particular emphasis on clean environment, materials and circularity, energy solutions and manufacturing and operational efficiency. Finally, I'm excited to announce that ANSYS has again been certified as a most loved workplace. This certification recognizes great workplaces based on employee surveys that gauge levels of respect, collaboration, support and a sense of belonging. In summary, Q1 was an outstanding quarter that has set the stage for the rest of 2023. As we have demonstrated by again beating guidance across all key metrics, our end markets remain robust and our business has proven its resilience, despite some economic uncertainties. Customers understand our compelling value proposition, which is driving their top line growth and delivering bottom line savings. Our continued momentum, the strong customer relationships, we have consistently demonstrated and our ongoing investments in technology will propel us through 2023 and beyond. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to achieve future milestones. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Nicole. Nicole? So Jay to answer there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions embedded in there, so let me try to do some justice to a couple of them perhaps. So when you think about the large sales so customers who have purchased more than $1 million or so in the quarter, I would say over 90%, have three or more physics and purchased three or more physics from ANSYS. And so that gives you some perspective of the strength of the multiphysics capabilities that we are able to bring to bear. As far as our products are concerned, obviously the strength of our flagship products is legendary. I mean everybody understands that we have a terrific product in the space. But what we've also seen is the interplay between products and the multiphysics nature of the portfolio I think coming through. So that's also been really helpful. And obviously the advances that we've made that I've talked about in electromagnetics, in CFD and structures et cetera across the portfolio in Optics, all of those advances we've made across those five vectors of technology that I talked about are all helpful and important in the way that we engage with our customers and in the value that they see from our products. So I'm feeling very good about our product portfolio. I'm feeling very good about our multiphysics strategy and our ability to service our customers. With respect to our partnership ecosystem maybe it's best to step back and talk a little bit about the philosophy. Look, we believe in an open ecosystem. I think it's very important for us for our customers to recognize that the vendors that they're working with are participating in the open ecosystem which means providing APIs, which means providing for interoperability and things of that nature. And so we are committed to that. We are working obviously with multiple -- other vendors to make sure that customers can benefit from technologies. And obviously no single customer is going to be completely dedicated to a single-vendor. They're going to have technologies from multiple-vendors. We want to make sure that that works for our customers. And so our partnership strategy is driven by that belief in an open ecosystem and the ability to work collaboratively to support customer needs. Thanks Jay. Yeah. So as far as moving earlier or sort of the democratization of simulation there are a number of things that we've been doing and I think that's continues to be important in our strategy. Number one is making our technology more accessible easier to use. We have certainly advances with respect to our discovery product portfolio. We continue to try to make the technology more accessible to less experienced engineers. Some of the -- if you -- I talked about some of the advances that we've made on technology on things like numerics and other areas of physics. We're democratizing simulation by really expanding the use case of problems think about problems that we can solve today that couldn't be solved earlier in a reasonable amount of time. The investments that we're making are allowing customers to take advantage of this advanced simulation capability and we see that as a form of democratization and certainly the investments that we're making across the GPUs, as well makes technology easier. There's some really interesting work that we're doing with AI/ML to help democratize simulation. As you know simulation can be difficult to set up and take an example of setting up something like a turbulent flow can be quite complex. And we're using AI/ML techniques, for example, to help democratize that and make that easy for end users to set up fluent simulations. And I could go on and on. With respect to cloud, obviously, accessing simulation on the cloud opens the door to smaller customers who may not necessarily have access to high-speed computing. That's certainly democratizing simulation and our continued investments in APIs I think also makes that easier for customers to build automation or special purpose applications on top of simulation. All of this in the aggregate extends the reach of simulation into areas where it wasn't being used before. Good morning. Well, Steve, I think one of the important things to recognize is, we've been investing in these technologies for a while. And so one of the reasons why, I wanted to take the time during the call, to go through them is, because there's just -- because of exactly the dynamic you mentioned. There appears -- there is a lot of activity in the marketplace and certainly people are aware of advances in technologies, and it's an area where there's been a lot of discussion. But if you think of areas like numeric, as an example, that's been the bread and butter of ANSYS. That's really understanding the mathematics, and the engineering, and the science around being able to appreciate and predict physical phenomena, and that is applicable of course across our portfolio. The HPC activity is certainly been included within our business, for a while. And if you think about the vectors of growth that we talked about in our Investor Day last year, we talked about more users. We talked about more products, and we talked about more computations. And the more computations vector is being driven by high-performance computing, and the desire for customers to solve larger and larger problems, which are solvable as you start to introduce additional cores, you starting to use GPUs and other architectures. So AI/ML is obviously, an area where we've been investing, as I said, for a while. And we have products in the market today, that are taking advantage of AI ML capabilities. So these are all technologies and I don't want to repeat what I said on the call, but these are all technologies and areas where there continues to be investment in -- within ANSYS, of course, across the industry and we continue to reap the benefit within our products to benefit our customers. So when you think about the AI capabilities that we've got, we're using AI in multiple areas. And one area that I mentioned of course is making it easier for people to use products. And I gave you example of Fluent earlier in what \u2013 in response to one of the questions. That's a great example of making the technology, making our flagships easier to use. Discovery is also making the technologies easier to use in a more in a more broad-based manner. The use of AI/ML is very targeted within the portfolio. But another direction that we're going and we talked about this in our investor meeting or Investor Day last year was our ability to start to support applications. And so one of the ways in which we can democratize simulation is not \u2013 is allowing users to take advantage of applications, purpose-built applications for their needs that are built \u2013 that take advantage of simulation. And to that end we've created a set of APIs based on Python which allow people to build applications workflows things of that nature that further democratize simulation. So we're taking multiple routes to be able to make that happen. And in each of the directions we're addressing a different opportunity to be able to broaden the use case of a simulation. Well certainly, the fact that we have the ability for people to write these automations or extensions taking advantage of the power of our portfolio using Python, where they can use other routines open source other things that are outside of simulation to bring that into a sort of an overall workflow. That is something that has helped us \u2013 that's helping us today. I mean there are examples of customers who have increased their use of ANSYS technologies because they've been able to build a very integrated workflow on top of this technology that allows more users to take advantage of what was previously restricted to a relatively small number of users. So that phenomenon that you're saying of driving incremental opportunity within our portfolio is absolutely the case. Furthermore, we would imagine outside of our outside of -- even outside of the engineering use case you could imagine long-term and this is a long-term statement, you can imagine other applications targeting others who are looking for the insights of physics-based simulation to be delivered to them. And we've talked about -- and certainly last year we talked about a healthcare example where someone delivering medical care or surgeon delivering medical care uses an application, which is built for that surgeon. It has nothing to do -- as far as their concern nothing to do with physics per se. They're all about delivering the care that they need to deliver. But underneath simulation is being done to influence the directions that they go. So those are examples of next-generation applications, which we believe will happen in the long-term but that's not a short-term impact. And so as we build out our capabilities we believe that we're enabling both the short-term opportunity as well as the long-term opportunity, which we've been calling the notion of being able to get pervasive insight. Well, I mean, obviously A&D continues to be one of our top industries. And our aerospace customers are facing complex challenges things like engine width design lightweighting those continue to be areas of investment for our customers, but also a lot of work on Space 2.0 and the ability to be able to launch payloads into space. That's another area where there continues to be a lot of interest. Obviously, commercial air is recovering post pandemic there continues to be more interest. And then of course from a defense perspective there's obviously a global perspective. You're seeing this certainly in the United States. You're seeing this as you see increased spending in Germany, for example. So all of that represents long-term tailwinds into the aerospace and defense industries. And we certainly are very well-positioned given the nature of our technologies to be able to take advantage of that. Yes. And just to amplify what Nicole said and to add a little bit more color as well. We're not tied to the number of units produced, right? So, if you cut back on production for whatever reason, your R&D efforts still continue, because you're building for the long term. And if you look at all of the industries that we serve, there are major transformations that are taking place in each of the industries and the long-term competitiveness of organizations is at stake. So if you're in the automotive industry, for example, electrification is front and center, autonomy is front and center. And stepping back from any of these activities will result in a long-term degradation of their business and no one wants to go to it. And so, what we're seeing and what we saw in the past, we saw this when we had this -- when Lehman went out of business back in the day, we saw that R&D was the last that was cut and we saw that it was the first thing that was restored.

But the lessons that we've learned is that the organizations that continue to invest in R&D were the ones that came out of that downturn and were successful afterwards. And so you see when we talk to customers, our value proposition is not just about accelerating R&D as I described. But our value proposition as Nicole said is also about being able to help cost. And we have well estab chapter inverse we can talk about how we can reduce warranty costs, how we can make engineers more efficient. We can talk about how we can reduce the amount of raw materials that have been used for experimentation purposes. They move away from physical prototyping. So that is a very hard ROI that we can make and we can make that case. Now I've spent -- I've talked to our sales leaders around the world. I've talked to customers around the world. And I'm only getting -- I'm getting strong support for our -- for the guidance that we've given you. We're seeing the markets -- the customers are committed. We're seeing that the nature of the technology that we provide is critical and we see our negotiations and discussions with customers kind of going as we expect. We call it as we see it.

We can give you a perspective on where our customers are how they're buying and all of that is reflected within -- all that is reflected within our within the way that we're guiding. So we feel great about the guidance we've given you. We feel great about the second half of the year. We feel great about Q2.

And for those of you who have been following our company for multiple years that underlying dynamic is exactly something that we've seen year after year after year. And we've always had quarters which are stronger in quarters which are relatively weaker in that context of the overall full year and so we manage to the full year. And that's important for us and we feel really good about where we are right now. I'm excited about our outstanding start to 2023. I would like to thank the one ANSYS team around the world for our ongoing success.

Thank you for joining us this morning. I hope you all have a great day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Nicole Anasenes",
            "content": "Thank you, Ajei. Good morning, everyone. Let me take a few minutes to add some perspective on our first quarter financial performance and provide context for our outlook and assumptions for Q2 and 2023. The first quarter demonstrated the strength of our business, as we delivered robust growth during Q1, and beat our financial guidance across all key metrics. ACV exceeded expectations and beat the high-end of our Q1 guidance in constant currency. Revenue, operating margin and EPS also exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Given the strength of demand for simulation and the momentum we see in our pipeline, we are operationally raising our full year ACV revenue and EPS. Operational improvements in our full year ACV outlook, is above and beyond our Q1 outperformance. I'll provide additional details on our guidance in a few minutes. Now, let me discuss some of our Q1 financial highlights. Beginning with ACV, we delivered $399.4 million in Q1, which grew 16% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency. As Ajei mentioned, our growth was broad-based in the quarter, with growth seen across geographic regions, customer types and industries. Our wide ranging growth is evidence of the essential nature of our market-leading simulation portfolio. ACV from recurring sources grew 12% or 18% in constant currency year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis and represented 82% of the total. This momentum in recurring ACV growth is driven by the strong annuity created by our ongoing shift to subscription leases. Q1 total revenue was $509.4 million and grew 19% or 22% in constant currency, which as I mentioned exceeded the high-end of our guidance, driven by the favorable mix of license types in the quarter. All geographic regions grew double-digits and contributed to revenue growth with the Americas leading the way. We had strong top line performance in Q1 with ACV and revenue, both growing double-digit in constant currency at 19% and 22% respectively. During the quarter, we delivered growth in excess of our model of double-digit growth including tuck-in M&A. We closed the quarter with a total balance of GAAP deferred revenue and backlog of $1.4 billion, which grew 13% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to manage our business with financial discipline. This yielded a solid first quarter gross margin of 91.2% and an operating margin of 39.8%, which was better than our guidance. Operating margin was positively impacted by outperforming on revenue, the favorable mix of license types as well as the timing of investments. The results with first quarter EPS of $1.85, which was also better than our guidance. Similar to operating margin, EPS benefited from strong revenue results and the timing of investments. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 17.5%, which is the rate that we expect for the remainder of 2023. Our unlevered operating cash flows in the first quarter totaled $269.5 million and grew 26.5% year-over-year, which benefited from strong collections. We ended the quarter with $507.9 million of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. In line with our capital allocation priorities, we repurchased approximately 650,000 shares during the quarter for around $196.5 million. We have 1.1 million shares available for repurchase under the current authorized share repurchase program. Now let me turn to the topic of guidance. We delivered an outstanding first quarter coming off an exceptional Q4 2022 and our updated 2023 forecast reflects the continued broad-based customer demand for a market-leading simulation portfolio. Looking to the remainder of the year, the pipeline of business has improved and continues to show momentum, which bolsters our confidence in achieving our 2023 and long-term outlook. However, offsetting our improved full year outlook is further strengthening of the US dollar against certain currencies particularly the Japanese Yen and Korean Yuan, relative to the exchange rates that were embedded in the outlook we provided in February. Notwithstanding the negative impact of exchange rates, our underlying business continues to demonstrate considerable momentum. Let me start with our full year 2023 guidance. We expect our full year ACV outlook to be in the range of $2.265 billion to $2.335 billion, which represents growth of 11.5% to 14.9% or 10.8% to 14.2% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our ACV guidance in constant currency growth by approximately 1-point. That constant currency increase is driven by robust demand and translates to an operational increase of $16 million relative to our short February guidance. Our improved outlook is in excess of the Q1 overperformance we delivered relative to our Q1 guidance. This operational momentum was fully offset by $16 million of foreign exchange headwind. We expect revenue to be in the range of $2.242 billion to $2.322 billion, which is growth of 8.2% to 12% or 7.7% to 11.6% in constant currency. We are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance in constant currency growth. Relative to our February guidance, our full year revenue increased $15 million from operational performance, which was fully offset by $15 million of foreign exchange headwind. As a result we expect our full year EPS to be in the range of $8.39 to $8.91 which represents an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint. Relative to our February guidance, our full year EPS increased by about $0.18 from better operational performance lower share count and higher interest income estimates, which was partially offset by absorbing $0.13 of foreign exchange headwind. Now, let me turn to our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance. As a reminder, we now provide guidance for unlevered operating cash flow as it aligns to the long-term cumulative $3 billion cash flow outlook we provided at our 2022 investor update in August. Our 2023 guidance is a range of $699 million to $749 million. Relative to our February guidance, our full year unlevered operating cash flow guidance is adversely impacted by $11 million of foreign exchange headwinds. The underlying operating leverage in our business remains robust. Despite the foreign exchange headwinds that have emerged since our February guidance, our current outlook of 8% to 16% unlevered operating cash flow growth building off 16% growth in 2022 demonstrates cumulative cash flow which exceed the ACV growth. Further details on the reconciliation of GAAP operating cash flow to the comparable non-GAAP unlevered operating cash flow are contained in our prepared remarks document. Now, let me turn to guidance for Q2. For the second quarter, we expect ACV in the range of $474 million to $494 million. Seasonal SKU of our renewal base that is unique to 2023 is driving a relatively more muted Q2 dynamic. However, as I've mentioned in the past quarterly dynamics can be volatile. For the first half of 2023, we expect to deliver strong double-digit growth. Our full year ACV outlook implies growth above our model in the second half of 2023 and is supported by a robust pipeline and a strong base of renewals that underpin that ACV growth. The first half second half dynamics embedded in our guidance are playing out as we expected when we initiated guidance in February. Turning to the P&L. We expect Q2 revenue in the range of $473 million to $498 million. We expect Q2 operating margin in the range of 31.9% to 34.1% and EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.53. Further details around specific currency rates and other assumptions that have been factored into our outlook for 2023 and Q2 are contained in the prepared remarks document. We have a strong forecast a highly recurring business model with three vectors of growth and a healthy backlog and pipeline all of which contributed to our confidence in our outlook and the underlying momentum of our business. This is reflected in the operationally increased outlook for ACV revenue and EPS. I would like to thank the entire ANSYS team for their outstanding execution in the first quarter, which drove robust financial performance and a strong start to 2023. We once again delivered a strong quarter, which coupled with the improvements in our sales forecast demonstrate the strength and resilience of the ANSYS business. I remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 and long-term outlook. Operator, we will now open the phone lines to take questions. Yeah, Jason, thanks for the question. Yeah, the business is playing out as we expected at the start of the year. Our Q2 renewal dynamic is something that was considered in our full year guidance when we initiated in February. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a structural dynamic -- timing dynamic in our renewal base for Q2 and that happens from time to time. But quarterly dynamics as we've always said can be really volatile and are not representative of momentum in the business. But what has changed since we initiated guidance in Q1 was as you point out we had a great Q1 where we not only grew 19% in constant currency, but we beat the midpoint of our guidance. And in addition to that our constant currency outlook for the quarter has improved. Our view of ACV growth before the impact of foreign exchange, which we talked about in the prepared remarks it's increased based on the development of our pipeline since initiating guidance in February. It's also underwritten by a highly recurring ACV model with over 80% of our ACV is recurring and a very strong base of renewals that we see in the second half. So if we step aside from the volatility quarters can have and you look at the implied ranges in our guidance, our guidance range implies double-digit constant currency growth for the first half and growth above our model of 12% in the second half again underwritten by that very strong renewal base, resulting in a 12.5% constant currency growth outlook at the midpoint, which is almost one point above the midpoint we indicated in February. So we feel really good about where we landed in Q1 after a really strong Q4 and strong 2022. And the guidance that we gave reflects the continued and improved optimism that we have overall in the business, notwithstanding, structural dynamics that sometimes happen in quarters, which introduced volatility. And that's why we are always focused on the full year and how we progress our view of the full year. You're welcome. Sure. So let me start with the first -- your first question. And then will go to the second. So in terms of the renewal base, the timing of customer renewals happen at natural cycles within the quarter. And as we have been moving to the strategic selling motion and bringing individual, kind of, development teams projects, in a customer to more strategic multiyear lease arrangements, sometimes the timing of renewals can shift on a year-to-year basis over time, right, which is the reason why we're very focused on the full year dynamic, because we take deals when they naturally occur because it optimizes the outcome for our customers, and it optimizes the outcome for ANSYS, which ultimately optimizes the outcome for investors. And so, the dynamic around the quarter is just something that happens from time to time. We had very, very strong Q1. The first half, is still strong in double digits. So we're feeling really good about where we're at, and there's nothing about Q2 that wasn't contemplated or seen or known when we started the year. As it relates to fewer 7- and 8-figure deals, I would say, the underlying dynamic around our large deal progression is not unchanged from any other prior Q1s. As you know, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter, you tend to have a lot more closing in the quarter. And so on a relative basis, there may be more mentions. But the underlying dynamics, around the strength of the pipeline, around the ability to drive strategic relationships, and larger deals with our customers customers' willingness to engage, customers willingness to close. None of those aspects have changed since we spoke in February, about how the shape of the business is progressing. Yes. That's absolutely, the case. I mean this is just about an over -- and you -- I know have been have been with us quite a while. You've seen quarters go up and down based on these renewal dynamics which is again why we focus on the full year. So there's nothing about the underlying dynamics in Q2 that are indicative of anything other than an underlying renewal base that has a SKU within the year that is driving those dynamics. No. I mean the underlying dynamics across all of our different customer segments have been performing pretty consistently as we've seen in prior Q1s. We had a lot of strength of course in the enterprise segment with the larger deals that we did this year and really strong in the Americas. But I would say we had strong growth across all three customer segments consistent with what we've had in the past. Yes. I mean I would say overall revenue linearity was somewhat \u2013 was pretty similar to what it was last year. It was slightly more skewed to the third month but it was pretty much in line overall. Yes. So we had spoken about DYNAmore for the full year as being about \u20ac30 million to \u20ac35 million with about half of it being in Q1 in our February call. And you can -- the underlying assumption you can make is that we're pretty in line with what we expected in February. Yes. I mean -- so here's the pragmatic answer to that is, if customers don't renew they lose access to the software and they can't build their products. And so the renewal base is very, very sticky because it affects their R&D cycles. And so -- and just to kind of take it a step back and to contextualize kind of, where we sit in the corporate decision-making process and what has happened in other kind of economic events. Simulation tends to be the last thing that gets shutoff and the first thing that gets turned back on. And that's because it is connected to people's R&D. And R&D tends to be -- the investments in R&D tend to be longer -- long-term views as opposed to short-term tactics. So that's one. The second is, even within the R&D process the areas that are most susceptible would be areas that are connected to seat counts and people and that's not how the economics of our software work. So our software is -- the way customers use our software is based on the capacity of compute that they need and the software that they need to run their simulations within their R&D cycle. And so, if there are underlying changes in the footprint of the R&D part of the business, it doesn't really affect our part of the software stack in the R&D cycle. And the last part is, simulation actually can provide tailwinds for -- and support the underlying cost efficiencies of our customers in their R&D cycle. Using simulation reduces the need for physical prototyping. It shortens the innovation cycle. You can have a single analyst run multiple simulations at the same time. And so, the throughput that you get and the efficiency that you get from using simulation to build products, has a very high ROI. And in times where you're looking to transform simulation is valuable, not just in accelerating time to value to accelerate the top line, but also to support running R&D in a more efficient manner. And so, those are the underlying qualitative dynamics, but the real answer on the renewal base is that, it's very, very sticky and a small short-term disruption in economic outlook has historically not had an impact on our overall business."
