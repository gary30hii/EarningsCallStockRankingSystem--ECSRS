[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to Jackie Burka McConagha, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJackie McConagha: Good morning, everyone. We are all truly heartbroken by the recent unexpected passing of our President and CEO, Arne Sorenson. He was an exceptional visionary leader but more importantly an exceptional human being. He will be deeply missed. As you are aware, Arne decided to reduce his schedule to fully focus on his health earlier this month, in consultation with the board Arne asked Stephanie Linnartz, the Group President of Consumer Operations, Technology and Emerging Businesses, and Tony Capuano, Group President of Global Development, Design and Operation Services, two longtime members of our leadership team to jointly oversee the company's day to day operation. Stephanie and Tony will continue in this capacity until our board appoints a new President and CEO, which is expected to occur in the next two weeks. Stephanie and Tony are joining us on our call this morning. As usual, we have Leeny Oberg, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Betsy Don, our Vice President, Investor Relations with us as well. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comment. Statements and our comments in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, or revPAR and occupancy comments reflect system wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Leeny.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. Like all of you, my heart is very heavy on Arne's passing. I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with such a wonderful and talented leader and to count Arne as a good friend. So many of you have reached out to us with your condolences for his family and for Marriott. And you've shared your fond memories of him. And we've been comforted by your kind words. Stephanie, Tony and I wanted to share a few stories with you about Arne as well this morning. In hospitality business work inherently includes a lot of travel. Those days when Arne was on the road, he would lead an early morning group run around the hotels neighborhood with his many associates as we're interested. As a fellow runner, I would join the crew and watch Arne somehow find a way to spend time with every runner in the group, to run ahead with the quick runners and then run back to the walkers and find a way to connect with each and every person, would ask them about their families, their roles at Marriott, and their points of view about their markets. The run would be over at 6:30. And then he would move on to a full day of meetings and at least five more hotel tours. You could tell he fed on these connections with people and that he cared about them deeply. I've learned so much from him, and I'll miss him tremendously. We're all committed to honoring our incredible leader by building on his legacy. And we of course want to update you on our business this morning as we move the company forward. Today, we will cover our usual earnings called topics with Stephanie focusing on the customer and demand side of the business. And Tony discussing our room's growth and development trends. I'll cover our financial results in liquidity. Given the uncertainty around the pace of vaccinations, and therefore demand recovery, we will not be providing earnings guidance today. We will however, share what we can about our outlook for 2021 and a few key areas. We'll plan to take your questions after our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Stephanie.\nStephanie Linnartz: Thank you, Leeny and good morning. This week we lost a wonderful friend and mentor. Arne was an incredible leader, both for Marriott and the industry. And he was fun in a competitive way. Like Leeny I also remember the countless times we ran together and he would always beat me, always. But what I will remember the most about Arne was his humility, his lack of ego and his passion for developing others. Arne and I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos together for the past six years. The first year I attended, I went to everything with Arne taking it all in and learning so much from all of his interactions. The second year we went pretty much as soon as we arrived, he pushed me out of the nest, so to speak. He encouraged me to schedule my own meetings and do my own media interviews. He believed I was ready. And in typical Arne fashion, he empowered me to grow. He knew what was best for me and for the company. That's the true leadership is believing in your team and helping your teammates believe in themselves. I am honored to have worked with him and we are all committed to building on his legacy. I know Arne would want us to talk about business. So let me start this off. COVID-19 has impacted our business to an extent we never imagined making 2020 by far the most challenging year in our company's history. Full year worldwide revPAR declined 60% with average occupancy of just over 35% compared to 73% for full year 2019. In 2020, occupancy and year-over-year revPAR changes showed steady improvement from the trough in April through the summer and into the early fall. However, with spikes in COVID cases in many markets around the world, we saw the global pace of recovery flattened in the fourth quarter, and in the first few weeks of 2021. Currently, over 94% of our hotels are open. Recovery trajectories to date have varied greatly by region. Mainland China, where there has generally been a sense that the virus is under control has led to recovery and strongly exemplifies the resiliency of demand. Occupancy reached 60% in July and remained above that level to the end of 2020. Fourth quarter revPAR in Mainland China was only down 12% year-over-year. We saw additional proof points have the ability for demand to recover quickly in other areas as well during the fourth quarter, including the Maldives and Dubai.  Occupancy in both markets jumped to over 60% in December, after their government's ease travel entry restrictions. In the fourth quarter, many countries around the world reinstituted strict temporary limitations on traveling and gathering to combat rising virus cases. Demand in the US was clearly sensitive to spikes in COVID cases and government travel advisories. As we saw during the traditionally travel heavy holiday period from Thanksgiving through New Year. Many cities in Europe also shut down. Similarly in China, we have recently seen several markets essentially unlocked down in January and February for several weeks at a time in order to fight the spread of the virus, leading to a meaningful drop in occupancy in these markets. Overall occupancy in mainland China year-to-date has fallen to an average of around 40%. The good news is that once these temporary shutdowns are lifted, we have seen demand return quickly. For example, occupancy in Chengdu and Qingdao recently jumped from around 20% to over 60% in just two weeks after their local governments announced the virus outbreaks were under control and remove travel restrictions. Our worldwide occupancy and year-over-year revPAR declined in January were roughly the same as we saw in December. Looking ahead to the rest of 2021, booking windows remain very short, and there is still a large amount of uncertainty. While vaccines are slowly rolling out, the pace is too uncertain to be able to predict when occupancy will move meaningfully higher. But as the year progresses, assuming wider distribution of effective vaccine, we are optimistic that the pace of recovery will pick up speed and accelerate throughout the year. In the US and Canada, we are encouraged to see some small green shoots of increased demand for corporate and leisure transient bookings, as well as in group lead volume. While still down meaningfully year-over-year, transient booking pays and visits to our direct booking sites have been improving recently, occupancy over Presidents Day weekend was the strongest we have had for a long weekend since the beginning of the pandemic led by leisure demand. And we are also starting to see a bit of momentum behind special corporate bookings. Group revenue pays in the US and Canada for 2021 is also still down significantly compared to group revenue pace for 2020 at the same time last year, so the declines are less severe for the second half of the year. In January, we had a very strong month for group bookings in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, this business was booked at average daily rates 11% higher than business booked in January 2020 per stays in 2021 and beyond. These are encouraging signs that there is strong demand for travel in future year once real progress has been made in containing the virus. As we think about marketing in this environment, our teams continue to analyze the latest consumer trends to help shape our recovery strategy. We are keenly focused on personalization and localization on capturing more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur, and on increasingly leveraging our digital direct channels, and in particular, our Marriott Bonvoy app. We recently released our updated redesigned Bonvoy app, with the goal of better meeting the travel shopping needs of today's leisure traveler. The power of the Bonvoy platform has become even more evident during the pandemic, as many of our more than 147 million members has continued to interact with us in ways other than staying in our hotel. Our Marriott Bonvoy credit card holders have remained particularly engaged. Global credit card spending on our cards for 2020 was down only 16% year-over-year, and marked contrast to the steeper decline in revPAR. And while not material from a financial perspective, one of the most significant expanded offerings to members recently has been our whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI, we grew the number of units on the platform from around 2,000 at launch less than two years ago to approximately 25,000 today We saw increased demand from our Marriott Bonvoy members with over 90% of HVMI roommates in 2020 booked by members. We continue to focus on driving demand to our hotels, and engaging with our members with creative content and special offers, including our escape to luxury, and Bonvoy escapes promotions. Additionally, early last year, we extended elite member status through early 2022. And we recently credited their accounts with another deposit of elite night credits to give them a head start towards elite status in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to thank our incredible team of associates around the world who have shown true dedication and resilience throughout these challenging times. Tony?\nTony Capuano: Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. Arne was a remarkable person, and I'm proud to call him a friend and mentor. One of my favorite trips with him sums up how truly special and unique he really was. After we acquired Starwood in 2016, Arne wanted his senior leadership team to do an eight day whirlwind trip around the world. He wanted to visit as many properties as we could to welcome our new associates and show them that the Marriott people first culture was real. And he wanted each of us there with him. As we toured property after property, already made a point to meet as many people as possible, to shake every hand and to look each person he met in the eye. He was so sincere and genuine. He also made sure to spend time with his leadership team outside of these meetings. In particular, I remember one overnight flight to the Middle East. Towards morning, Arne woke us all up and brought us to the lounge in the back of the plane. So we could just spend time together and enjoy each other's company. This was classic Arne. He wanted to build a cohesive team that was not afraid of some spirited debate, truly liked and respected each other. And it worked. Our jobs are infinitely easier because we're all rowing in the same direction. Now being the humble person that he was, I think Arne would say that we need to move on to the business. So let me now talk about our room's growth. In 2020, we added nearly 63,000 rooms worldwide for room's growth of 4.6% on a gross basis. Room openings in the year were impacted by slower construction timelines, and supply chain issues, as well as some owners temporarily waiting to open their hotels due to COVID-19. Asia Pacific was the one region where we open more rooms in 2020 than we did in 2019. Adding over 18,000 rooms with gross room's growth of over 8% versus year in 2019. In China, we recently opened our 50th Hotel in Shanghai, the JW Marriott Shanghai Function, and a phenomenal accomplishment as our international growth continues to strengthen. On a net basis, including deletions of 1.5%, our global distribution grew by 3.1% year-over-year. Deletions were generally in line with the average levels we've seen over the last three years, despite a number of hotels exiting our system for COVID-19 related reasons. While signings for full year 2020 were not as robust as we had expected at the beginning of the year. Our overall pipeline continues to lead the industry totaling over 498,000 rooms at year end. We also benefited from continued momentum in our residential branding business, and had another strong year for residential signings, a testament to the power of our brands. For the full year 2021, assuming progress is made and containing the virus, we expect gross room's growth to accelerate to approximately 6%. While we have seen some delayed construction starts and could continue to see some delays in openings, 46% of our pipeline is already under construction. Additionally, we anticipate benefiting from the backlog of openings that were pushed from 2020 into this year. We also expect to see a meaningful impact from conversions this year, as owners and their lenders seek the incremental top and bottom line benefits from being part of the Marriott system. We are extremely pleased with our recently announced conversion deal in [Cawa] that is expected to add 19 resorts and nearly 7,000 rooms to our all inclusive portfolio. Our biggest deal yet in Cawa, these hotels fit perfectly with our focus on leisure currently the strongest segment of demand. And while they were not in our year end pipeline, these properties are all anticipated to join our system during 2020. Let's now shift to our 2021 outlook. for net room's growth, not including the approximate 100 basis point one time headwind from the 89 Service Properties Trust or SPC mostly limited service hotels that are leaving our system by the end of March, we expect deletions of 1.5% to 2%. That's slightly higher than we have experienced recently, due to the potential for more COVID-19 related exits. Coupled with our gross room's growth expectation, we expect net room's growth of roughly 3% to 3.5%, including the exiting SPC rooms. We have already received interest from multiple owners about new deals in those markets, and look forward to the opportunity to replace many of the first generation limited service SPC hotels with newer product. A key component of our demand recovery strategy is remaining keenly focused on the health and safety of our guests and associates. We first introduced our heightened cleanliness standards in April of last year. Since then, we've been increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such as mobile and web check in, mobile key and mobile chat to reimagine the guest stay experience for this environment. Last month, we began rolling out additional health protocol options for group meetings at certain properties, including on site temperature checks, and providing for COVID testing capabilities. We've also remained focused on working closely with our owner and franchisee community to help them navigate these challenging times and have taken many steps to significantly lower their costs in this environment. These steps include waiving FFE contributions for most hotels with lender concern, reducing certain fixed charges for programs and services and extending the delay on renovations. We are also working with hotels on payment plans when necessary, and we are very pleased that the vast majority of our hotels are paying their bills. I also wanted to acknowledge our associates this morning. They have exemplified the Marriott culture throughout the pandemic. Whether it's looking after first responders, prepping meals for those in needs, or hosting blood drives at our hotels. They are a remarkable team and we could not be more proud. I will now turn the call back over to Leeny to talk about our fourth quarter financials in more detail.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. In the fourth quarter of 2020, worldwide revPAR declined 64% with occupancy of 35%. As Stephanie noted Mainland China continued to lead the recovery. Leisure remains the strongest driver of demand in Mainland China. And in the fourth quarter stays in the leisure segment were up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Business transient group demand in the region also continued to rebound well in the fourth quarter. And we've been pleased to see this evidence of pent-up demand across all travel segments. In fact, group stays comprised around 20% of overall room nights in the fourth quarter back in line 2019 distribution. Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with occupancy reaching 35%, up 10 percentage points from the third quarter, primarily driven by domestic leisure travel in Australia, South Korea and Japan as well as economic reopening efforts in countries like the Maldives and India. In the US and Canada, leisure and drive to destinations remained the strongest markets throughout the fourth quarter. RevPAR declined 65% in the quarter in line with a year-over-year third quarter decline, with occupancy of 35% just below third quarter's level of 37%. The seasonal decline in occupancy that typically happens during the fourth quarter was less pronounced in 2020. Given the overall lower level of business travel. Trends in EMEA were mixed. Fourth quarter occupancy in the Middle East and Africa reached 36%, an 11 percentage point improvement from third quarter, reflecting strong domestic leisure demand in many major markets in the Middle East. The recovery in Europe took a step back in the last few months of 2020 as most countries re-imposed restrictions after major second waves of the virus. During the fourth quarter, roughly one third of our hotels in Europe were temporarily closed and occupancy fell to 15%. In [Cala] around 20% of hotels were closed during the fourth quarter resort properties, particularly in Mexico drove an improvement in occupancy to 24% in the region, up from 15% in the third quarter with global revPAR down 64%, our fourth quarter gross fee revenues totaled $423 million, a decline of 57% versus the year ago quarter, largely in line with the year-over-year decline we saw in the third quarter. Over 60% of the $44 million of fourth quarter incentive management fees were earned in Asia Pacific, of which three quarters were earned in Greater China. Over 95% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in the fourth quarter, with over 90%, generating positive profits for the full year. These results reflect the strong rebounding demand when the virus is under better control and our ability to help our owners control costs. Within franchise fees our non revPAR related franchise fees continued to be resilient, totaling $133 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% from the year ago quarter, with credit card branding fees down 18%. Fourth quarter G&A improved by 31% year-over-year, reflecting our significant cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our total income tax provision was a benefit of $150 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of pre acquisition Starwood tax audit. We reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $317 million down 65% versus the fourth quarter of last year essentially the same decline as in the third quarter. I'll now turn to cash burn as we've described on prior calls, our monthly cash burn rate was only slightly negative in the fourth quarter even with revPAR down 64%. The impact of the company's $130 million 401-k match payment in October and higher cash interest due to the timing of payments will partially offset by continued strong receivables collection efforts and robust loyalty cash flows. We've been pleased with the strength of our cash generation in 2020 in light of the dramatic reduction in revenues. Our full year financial show net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, which included the one time $920 million of proceeds from our amended co brand credit card agreements; subtracting out the $920 million as well as all investment spending, we still generated positive operating cash flow, a strong performance in the year when revPAR was down 60%. These results show the true power of our asset light business model, and are a testament to our company's ability to quickly and effectively adapt to a significant and rapid change in demand. Loyalty was a key piece of the equation generating over $500 million of net cash flow in 2020 after being a net user of cash in 2019. This year's positive cash generation from loyalty is on top of our credit card related fees including an EBITDA, as well as the $920 million of cash received from our amended co brand credit card agreements. The loyalty program benefited from strong cash inflows from our credit card programs given the resilience of consumer credit card spending. While the loyalty programs operating cost and redemption expenses were down significantly. Redemption expenses were much lower than usual in terms of both volume of nights, and the rate paid hotels for redemptions given the low occupancy environment. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion after the pay down of over $600 million of debt during the quarter. The company's net liquidity represents roughly $800 million in available cash balances, plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positioned us to meet our short and long-term obligations. I also want to briefly discuss the $243 million fourth quarter charge related to the Sheraton Grand Chicago put shortly after the Starwood deal closed, we granted the hotel owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Given the current environment, we have determined the put is likely to be exercised so we increased our liability. We have the right to defer the closing on the put until late 2024. Moving on to full year 2021, while we won't be giving revPAR or earnings guidance, I'll provide a bit of color on certain items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current revPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in revPAR compared to 2019 revPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of revPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 revPAR compared to 2020 revPAR could be more like $15 million to 20 million. As we saw throughout 2020, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMS and the inclusion of non revPAR related franchise fees as well. In order for us to start earning IMS in the US and other markets where IMS stand aside to owner priorities, we'll need to see substantial improvement in revPAR levels. We anticipate that the majority of IMS in 2021 will again be earned in international markets. We expect our non revPAR related fees to remain resilient and show strong year-over-year growth in 2021. We expect G&A to total $775 million to $800 million in 2021. Note that the cash component of G&A will be lower than this range given non cash stock compensation. Interest expenses anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Turning to several other major items that will impact cash flow, our cash taxes are expected to be $275 million to $300 million for full year 2021. Investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the full year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time for total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. Approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance CapEx in our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. We expect cash flows from the loyalty program to be roughly neutral in 2021 even after the reduced payments we will receive from the co brand and credit card companies that effectively repay roughly one third of the $920 million received in 2020.  In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we are optimistic that we will see notable progress over the course of this year. We've seen real evidence of the pent-up demand for travel. And we look forward to welcoming more and more guests to our hotels. We will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.\nShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess I just like to start by offering my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson and Marriott family and team regarding Arne's passing. I think we all appreciate the stories and memories that everyone shared on the call. And we're all better people for having gotten to spend time with him. So you will be warmly remembered and greatly missed by all of us. If I could turn pinch -- if I could turn attention maybe to some of the comments and appreciate all the color that the team has put together this morning. Yes, I think maybe a good place to start would be to refer to some of Stephanie's remarks around some of the green shoots that she alluded to, and that we're starting to see in the travel environment. So Stephanie, if possible I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of your comments around the group booking position as we move across the year if you could help to give us a little bit more on that. And then specifically the rate commentary, you mentioned the up 11% if you can help us unpack that a little bit. I think that's highly encouraging and a little different than we might expect to see in a different hotel environment or a different cycle.\nStephanieLinnartz: Sure, of course, and good morning, Shaun. So as it relates to our group business. We are encouraged to see some really positive trends as I mentioned in the prepared remarks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, our group pace for 2021 it was down negative 57%. But the second half of the year was down just 25% to 30%. We're also on the group front seeing some positive trends as it relates to group canceled; they've really slowed for the second half of 2021. And they are at normal levels for 2022 plus. We're also seeing some great trends on lead volume. While it's certainly behind 2019, it's improving. As a matter of fact, over the last 45 days, lead volume has increased 20 to 30 percentage points. So in a significant improvement from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. The other thing I note on the group home, we're starting to see a pickup in what I'd call more normal types of groups. So as an example, we're starting to see some incentive meetings book in the fourth quarter of this year. And to your question about rate, yes, January was not only a strong booking month, which was terrific, actually the best month we've had in a couple years, but the rate was up on for futures 11%. And you should know most of those groups that were booked into the future years, those higher rates were in house group versus city wise, we haven't quite seen citywide bookings come back yet. So I think that the story on the group front just underscores the point that there will be a return to meetings and group business and it may be slower than we would like. But we're seeing that we're seeing the demand and as you can imagine, Shaun we are talking to our customers all the time meeting planners our top accounts, and they all want to get back out on the road and on -- and travel. We're also seeing in China some quite positive things on the group front. As a matter of fact, the bookings in China, group bookings were up to 20% of our room nights, again, which was encouraging. China's a great story, it shows that there's pent-up demand for travel. Six weeks after this firework was announced in China, people started booking roommates again, started with leisure, but then quickly towards as the year moved on moved to both business travel and group. And of course, much of it, most of it was domestic, but still strong demand. So we're very encouraged as to what we're saying on the group front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.\nJoeGreff: Good morning, everybody. I'd like to offer my condolences as well. Arne was obviously a talented executives and everybody respected him for what he's done over the years at Marriott for the lodging industry, but I remember him is just being a good man and how he treated everybody so respectfully and something to aspire to for everybody else. So I know it's a big loss for you guys. So I just wanted to mention that. So my question is for you, Tony, I was I was hoping on the gross room to outlook commentary for this year, if you can go through the composition of the gross rooms, how much of it? Is conversions, how much of it is new construction and of the new construction, I guess how much of it is pre-COVID vintage versus any limited service? New construction that maybe thinks about is commencing since March of last year? And then as you think about investments spent for the balance of what's in the pipeline next to the 2021 gross room's openings. Do you think that accelerates in 2022 and beyond relative to what you're spending this year?\nTonyCapuano: Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your kind sentiments, most appreciated. I think as we think about 2021 openings, obviously, we've indicated in our prepared remarks and acceleration to about 6% gross openings. And to state the obvious, there's more limited visibility than we've had into the markets, pre-COVID. But there are a number of factors, I think that give us some measure of comfort that support our guidance. I think number one, we've got about 230,000 rooms under construction around the world as we sit here today. You also heard us talk a little bit about the Sunwing all inclusive projects, adding 7,000 rooms that give us almost 100 basis points of growth in gross openings in 2021. To your point there were a number of hotels under construction last year that had been targeted for 2020 openings, and they slipped principally because of COVID related construction delays and we expect a significant number of those hotels to open in 2021. And then I think the last thing I would say is that while it's certainly early days, we're only 10 or 11 weeks into the year, we're seeing some encouraging signs related to accelerating conversions activity. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2020, about 21% of our signings were conversions. And that was the highest percentage contribution from conversions that we had seen since the first quarter of 2019. And so we did go back and take a look at some previous cycles. And in fact, it's the last peak, we saw conversions spike all the way up to about 24% of total signings. And I think that's quite encouraging as well. The only other thing I would add, Joe is that also gives us some measure of comfort. We've seen from quarter-to-quarter since the pandemic started a relatively steady level of rooms under construction. And obviously, we've shared that with you and each of the quarterly calls.\nLeenyOberg: And Joe when you think about on the investment front, obviously, as you're adding more rooms on a relative basis to 2020, you see a little bit more investment but when you think about the kind of classic typical investment, either per deal or per average key and a full year, I would say we're not seeing any sort of meaningful increase in the amount of investment that we're needed to put into deals. And obviously, when you look at our pipeline, for example, in the US, which is 80%, limited service they're typically the investment is far less. And so I think while you would expect that our investment will increase a bit relative to the really low 2020 levels, I would not expect it to see it take kind of meaningful step up relative to the overall numbers of rooms.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.\nThomasAllen: Hey, good morning, and let me just echo my condolences to Arne's family and all of you at Marriott. As analysts, we were lucky enough to watch him as an incredible CEO, and experienced him as an amazing leader. And just it will be truly missed. So for me, can we just talk about the all inclusive strategy a bit more? In 2019, you announced the Elegant Hotels acquisition and you've been intermittently announcing some more organic growth. And then that was the announcement this week, or last week about with Sunwing. Can you just talk about what you've been learning so far as you've kind of built up this business? Thank you.\nTonyCapuano: Sure. Thank you, Thomas. I think maybe I'll talk a little bit about all inclusive from a growth and a deal side. And then I might ask Stephanie to chime in from a demand and a leisure perspective. On the transaction side, As we talked about, when we launched into the all inclusive space, it was frustrating for us to see the pace of growth in the all inclusive space, certainly in [Cala] but even in Southeast Asia and some of the Eastern European resort markets and not to have a platform to compete for those opportunities. Since our launch, the market reaction from the development community has been quite significant. I think one of the things that give us so much enthusiasm about the Sunwing announcement, beyond of the fact that it's great, rapid increase in our footprint. It has accelerated the volume of inquiries we're getting about new opportunities, particularly on the conversion side. And Sunwing is a terrific partner for us. They have been in the all inclusive space much longer than we have. And we think it is going to be a very symbiotic relationship where we both have a lot to teach each other. Stephanie, maybe you can chime in with a little bit on leisure demand.\nStephanieLinnartz: Yes, sure. Absolutely. We are really excited to see are offering them all inclusive properties grow for our consumers on leisure demand is very -- is the strongest segment right now. And it is also leisure is as a segment overall growing even faster than business travel. So we see a lot of runway for continued leisure demand. What we're most excited about with our all inclusive properties is we're going to have on properties across seven of our brands, seven of our premium and luxury brands. And it's going to be a terrific offering particularly for our Marriott Bonvoy members. It is really anything that makes the Marriott Bonvoy programs stickier and more engaging is great for our business. So whether it's growing our all inclusive business, HVMI, of course are terrific leisure properties around the world. We just see the growth of all inclusive is a great proposition for our consumers.\nThomasAllen: And then just sticking on the development front in the past, you used to do about one bolt-on acquisition a year, they can delta or -- Gaylord is the current environment, creating opportunities, and how do you think about balancing it with your balance sheet? Thanks. \nTonyCapuano: Sure. I think there are lots of conversations. I think from where I sit, I'll be surprised if there is a high volume of activity because I think buyer and seller pricing expectations are still out of alignment. And I think there may be some distressed circumstances where transactions occur. But I do think that gap is significant. I will -- we will continue to look and if we see something that makes sense, we'll use the same lens that we've always applied to the evaluation of bolt-on acquisitions. Does it fill a gap for us in terms of either geographic distribution or segment? And are the economics compelling? Also, maybe the last fine point I would put on that not only for individual hotel transactions, but for M&A transactions. The financing markets are challenging at best. And I think that will have some cooling effect potentially on the volume of M&A deals you see in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.\nStephenGrambling: Good morning. I also want to share my condolences to everyone on the call, as well as the entire Marriott and Sorenson family. We will miss Arne's voice, his openness and his outrageously pretty fast response time and emails, which I guess is just another size ability to connect everyone. So Leeny you mentioned G&A in the $775 million to $800 million range, can you help us think about the different levers of costs that were removed? And how we may expect somebody to return perhaps in 2022 and beyond a more robust recovery? And as a related follow up how do you think about permanent reductions in management costs or charge outs to owners that could also bolster margins for them and allow you to recapture IMS at a lower bound revPAR?\nLeenyOberg: Yes, sure, thanks. So first of all, on the corporate G&A front when you look at these levels, compared to the 2019 levels, you're looking at a high teen reduction in comparison, and you do need to remember that both of those numbers include bad debt. And while in the long run bad debt is a cash cost, it is kind of in the year for the year often not a cash cost, because it's a reserve taken. And again, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly where that'll go in 2021. I think you would normally expect in this environment, it might be a little bit higher than normal levels. And certainly in 2019, it was not even anything to worry about. But overall, I would say from a cash perspective, you would see that our cash costs on a G&A front with this $775 million to $800 million is that reduction is a bit higher than the high teens sort of number that I've described on the expense line. And when I think about it going forward, Steven, I would say a couple things. First of all, obviously, I would expect that some will need to be added back as we move forward into a much improved picture for our industry. But I will also say that we undertook some work in 2020. That was while extraordinarily painful and difficult, I think was a reflection that we view that it will take some time for the industry to recover. And we really need to put ourselves in a position where we could make these cost savings last a very long time, if not permanently. So while you could see costs go up more than inflation, I think you will see most of these savings be sustainable. And similarly on the hotel front we've done a lot of work to do things that are both temporary and sustainable on the cost front. We've obviously done some temporary reductions in fixed costs at the hotel level; we've obviously done some again really painful work in the way of furloughs, et cetera. But we've also done some really innovative things around how to better staff the hotels how to better get our work done, how to manage some of the programmatic costs that go to the hotels. And I think those, again will be sustainable. When I think about in 2021, what we've tried to do is gone to as much of the margins that we had in 2019 as possible. So while I think the hotel margins will obviously suffer from a reduction in revenues compared to 2019, at the hotel level, we did we think we have been able to save the vast majority of that margin decline through the work that we've done. And then obviously, as we move into a much more normal picture, there will be sustainable savings that allow us to get to a profitability point that returns back to where it was much quicker.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedesRose: Hey, good morning, our condolences as well as regarding Arne and just thinking about him, it just seems like he's always struck me as a man with such kind of grace, and that it's just really sad that he's not with us anymore. But I wanted to ask you really just a little bit more about the relationship with owners who may be facing financial stress. And what, if anything Marriott is doing I guess in terms of concessions or delayed payments or any other kinds of relief and whether some of those might be permanent?\nLeenyOberg: Sure. I talked the question before about some substantive work that we've done to try to match the cost with the revenue decline in the short term, and again, try to make a bunch of it sustainable, but overwhelmingly, our owners are paying us and we've had tremendous success in collecting our receivables. Most hotels have reopened. And obviously, amongst the select service hotels, quite a few of them are actually cash flow positive. We have arranged payment plans for a large number of our hotels. And when you think about it typically, Smedes, they pay us in 30 days, and to be able to stretch that out over several months is a big help. And we're seeing there, again, overwhelmingly that they are making payments on those payment plans. And while they're obviously we need to get back to where there's substantial recovery to get them to a much better spot. For the moment, they are hanging in there, and they are able to pay some down and work with us to be able to navigate through this time. But I do agree with you, we are paying incredible attention to our costs on property and working with the owners to try to find ways to do even more. And a lot of this depends on what the owner's particular situation is too in terms of how well capitalized, what is the debt structure, and what kind of market they're in. But overwhelmingly, we have seen really strong performance and the newest information about the PPP loan extension and expansion, as well as whatever may come from a stimulus bill, hopefully will be added benefit to them as well.\nSmedesRose: Okay, thank you. And then I just wanted to ask you on the agreement with Sunwing, did Marriott pay any upfront money for those properties come into the system? And also, did the owner agree to invest in the incremental CapEx or do you feel like they are kind of ready to go?\nLeenyOberg: Well, I'll take the first one. And then I'm going to turn it over to Tony for the second one. And we would never get into specifics on a particular deal. But I can tell you that this was a very, very capital light deal. I'll just leave it there.\nTonyCapuano: And I think similarly on the second half of your question, these are terrific physical assets. There are some modest renovation requirements. But these are pretty conversion ready assets that we're excited to get into the system and start welcoming of our Bonvoy guest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust Securities.\nPatrickScholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Certainly our deepest condolences to both the Sorenson and Marriott families. Obviously it goes without saying; we will deeply miss him very much. Question for you, you talked about 94% of your hotels at the end of the year, open and find 6% not open. How might you think or what do you internally think about the trajectory of reopenings? And I assume those are mostly urban top 25 hotels, correct?\nStephanieLinnartz: Well, so let me help you a little bit here. Thank you, Patrick. And we appreciate your thoughts. So first of all, in US and Canada, we're only talking 3% of the hotels. So only 159 in all of North America, the biggest concentration is in Europe, where 34% of themselves are closed. And then also in Caribbean, Latin America, where 11% of the hotels are closed. So I would say there, there can be some true structural reasons why in those markets, government regulations, actually, in some cases require that the hotels be closed. So I think one of the things that we've all learned over the last year is that in many cases, even down at levels of 10% to 15%, occupancy, a hotel can be better off being open, than it is closed from a cash flow perspective. And we began done everything we can, most of our charges, as you know are based on revenues. So that floats with the occupancy. So I think in general, we would, as you see, things start to pick up a little bit. Hopefully, as the vaccinations continue to progress even more than you will start to see these remaining closed hotels open up. \nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Robin Farley of UBS.\nRobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Please let me add my condolences on Arne's loss. I am very sad obviously; he was such an unfailingly kind person. So let me add my condolences. My question is on the unit growth topic. I know conversions visibility is kind of more limited maybe only within the next few months and removals kind of similarly. But when we think about growth unit additions from kind of new construction that would happen next year in 2022. A lot of that would probably be underway or have to be underway already now. So I guess I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on the gross unit additions for 2022. In another words, you're trying to get a feel for whether how much of the acceleration in growth additions in 2021 is the opening pickup pushed from 2020 to 2021. And kind of what that may look like past that the impact of those openings sliding into 2021. Thank you.\nTonyCapuano: Thank you, Robin. As I said in response to one of the earlier questions, state the obvious the there's a lot less visibility into the future than we've had prior to the pandemic. I think beyond 2021, we're going to need to get a bit further into the economic recovery. And to see how quickly the financing markets rebound. And how quickly construction starts begin to pick up. As I said, we do have 230,000 rooms under construction. But it is interesting as I talk with our transactors around the world; the good news is we're generally not seeing much in the way of fallout of under construction projects from the pipeline. I think if there's going to be an impact; it will likely be further impact on the length of the construction cycle. And so it's a little tough to know what that looks like in 2022. I am hopeful that in the next couple quarters that visibility will improve a little bit. But I just don't think we've got great visibility beyond 2021 at this point.\nRobinFarley: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. I was actually surprising how many rooms are under construction very similar to what it was a year ago. And actually, given everything that's gone on, I would have thought that new starts would have made that number lower but it it's fairly consistent and it's only 1,000 rooms different than a year ago. So that's why it seemed potentially encouraging for 2022 but --\nTonyCapuano: We agree that's one of the statistics we've been watching. And to your point it's quite encouraging that we've seen such stability in the volume of under construction rooms around the world.\nRobinFarley: And then just one quick follow up, can you give a little more color around the put option? It's just -- when you -- we normally look at your, what's added back for restructuring or for acquisition costs related to Starwood obviously, that production is a significant amount. So just a little bit of color around that. Thank you.\nStephanieLinnartz: Yes, sure. Absolutely. Yes we always say we're overwhelmingly done with the integration. And we're kind of hopeful that this is the last bid. But when we acquired the company, Starwood management agreements for the Sheraton Grand Chicago in the Western Times Square included very broad cross brand territorial, which actually, when you think about it, that for the rest of our 28 brands, we were severely limited in those areas. So soon after we did the deal, we entered into a settlement agreement with a hotel owner, where basically, we granted that owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in the hotel to Marriott in 2022, for $300 million in cash. Now, it's worth noting that there is a ground lease underneath this hotel, we actually don't have to buy that if we want to buy that land, we'll have the right to for an additional $200 million. But it is worth noting that there is a ground lease on the hotel as well. But this is providing the interest in the hotel. The other interesting part is that, given the current economic conditions, we believe that the put is probable of being exercised. And as a result, we need it to reflect what we think is the current value. And obviously all these markets are struggling. And that resulted in this charge. The other thing that's worth noting is that we actually have the right to not actually close on the put until late 2024. So even though it could get put to us in 2022, we wouldn't necessarily have to buy it until the end of 2024. And so it's actually worth noting that also part of the impairment that we had in the contract amortization line reflects the fact that frankly, right now, if you ask us, we would expect that we would defer that purchase until the end of 2024. And continue to manage the hotel until the end of 2024 to take into consideration the fact that we don't buy it until then. The other part that I guess I'll add is that since that agreement was signed, we've actually added 4,000 rooms in the Chicago and New York markets. So while it is painful, and clearly a direct result of COVID. We do think that in the broad picture, it's really important for us to be able to have the capability to expand our brands and that really important market.\nRobinFarley: And as the value of the hotel improves over the next two years or between now and late 2024. You would reverse some of the loss I would assume value that's being run through.\nStephanieLinnartz: Yes. Obviously, you've got to look at that every single quarter. And we would but this was question of a whole lot of different factors as we move over the next few years, but fundamentally, yes, you're right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.\nVinceCiepiel: Great thanks. I also wanted to express my sympathy to Arne's family and the Marriott team. He certainly will be missed. I had a question on leisure. You mentioned the favorable trend lines there expectations for outperformance in that segment for some time meeting that demand with the all inclusive offering. I wanted to dig more into your homes and villas. Just curious how you think you're progressing there? What do you think about the trend lines and demand for short term rentals as we live in an increasingly remote world, and how you think you're meeting the needs of those around 150 million loyalty members in terms of their interest, an appetite for short term rentals.\nStephanieLinnartz: Great. Well, thank you, Vince for that question. Yes. We really are excited about HVMI primarily as an offering for our Marriott family members. We launched that business in 2019 with about 2,000 homes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and the reason we launched the businesses, we were talking to our Marriott Bonvoy member, an eight out of 10 of them said not only-- not that they were just thinking about renting a home, but they actually had done it through another platform. So we knew it was an offering they wanted that we didn't have. And we knew it would be complimentary to our core hotel business. So we launched the business in 2019, we've grown to 25,000 homes, there is about a couple million homes in the segment in which we play in, I think it's really important when we talk about HVMI to make some distinctions from other platforms. First of all, we only have whole homes. We also, it's not an open platform, like some of the other players; you can't just put a home on there. We only work with professional housing management companies. And we have very, very strict standards about what type of premium and luxury homes will allow on the platform standards around amenities, design aesthetic, service levels, on safety, security, et cetera. So we are very strict about which homes get on the platform. And one of the most important things about HVMI is you can earn loyalty points and burn oil loyalty points there. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that 90% of our bookings are coming from loyalty members and also 30% of the bookings on redemptions, people are redeeming their Marriott Bonvoy points. And we saw the business do well, particularly during last summer because people wanted a whole home 40% of our HVMI destinations are actually new to Marriott there where we don't have hotels, and many of them are in more remote locations, which really was quite attractive during COVID. So we're excited about the offering and we see it as complimentary to our core business and a tremendous value proposition for Marriott Bonvoy members.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Dori Kesten of Wells Fargo Securities.\nDoriKesten: Good morning, everyone. I also wanted to offer my condolences. Arne was really one of a kind that will be sorely missed. I was wondering I guess this is for Leeny. How important is it for Marriott internally to return to share purchases and or dividends? And is there anything beyond your leverage target that we should be using as a timeline guide?\nLeenyOberg: No, I don't think so. I think obviously, the stability of the marketplace will be important. I am kind of assuming that we continue on the beginnings of this recovery and get to a much more stable place. I think we clearly have to recognize that it will take us a little while to get back to where our leverage ratios or where we want them to be. And we will need to be considering whether the market is as stable as it was from 2012 through 2019. When you think about the volatility of our cash flows, but I think broadly speaking, looking at our business model, and the way we generate cash, that I think the fundamental strategy is still the same, which is grow absolutely the best way we can, with really efficient use of capital, resulting in a business model that generates significant excess cash over and above what we need to reinvest in the business. And in that respect, we would look forward to returning to both modest dividends and share repurchase.\nDoriKesten: Okay, thanks. And Stephanie and as a follow up, if you look out three years, how would you expect your exposure to leisure business transient and group to have shifted or you have the belief that will eventually return to the distribution that we had over the last few years?\nStephanieLinnartz: Yes, when we look medium, longer term past COVID. We think there is robust demand for travel across all segments, leisure, business travel, group meetings. There could be some slight shifts here and there. But again, as I mentioned, we -- when this disease when COVID gets under control, we see the demand come back. And we're already on the business travel side. We're seeing -- we're starting to see green shoots, our special corporate bookings in January in the month for the month were the best that we've seen since last fall. And when we look at the bookings from our corporate accounts further out, we're seeing them tick up each week, particularly from accounting and consulting firms and technology companies. So again, post COVID we see robust travel demand across all segments, again, could there be some shifts here and there? Yes. But we're quite bullish on the overall outlook.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon of Macquaire.\nChadBeynon: Hi, good morning. I'd also like to offer my condolences as well, we all learned so much from Arne. And he was such a kind person to all of us. So thank you. Tony, somewhat of a hypothetical, but how do you think domestic price integrity in ADRs will play out once occupancies improve? I guess, near term in the back half of 2021. And then medium term in 2022, obviously, this is a the higher component of house profit and IMS, was there anything that you saw in China in the fourth quarter in terms of how pricing played out and anything to think about this from prior cycles?\nStephanieLinnartz: Sure, Chad. I think, this is Stephanie. I'll take that one on pricing. I mean, pricing is really about compression, not trip purpose. And so in normal times, we can get compression from leisure business in our resorts when they're quite busy or special events on and our retail rates, we don't really differ between business and leisure. We do have some negotiated volume discounts for corporate accounts. But the key to pricing really is about occupancy, rebounding. And right now, that's the challenge. I mean in terms of ADR, it fell very steeply in April and May of last year. And that was driven by very low occupancies. And we had caregiver rates in the lake and our hotels, but the occupancy did tick up throughout the year. Of course, it varies market to market. In general, last year, we saw luxury ADR hold up fast with extended stay ADR next and again, it really does get to compression. I think it'll be interesting to watch this recovery. If demand comes back much more quickly than we anticipated, we may be able to grow ADR faster than we did coming out of the last downturn. But again, it's really about -- it's more about impression than it is about a trip purpose. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. I'll now return the call to Leeny Oberg for additional or closing comments.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining this morning. We can't wait to see you out on the road. And thank you again so much for your kind thoughts. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in Marriott International Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephanie Linnartz",
            "content": "Thank you, Leeny and good morning. This week we lost a wonderful friend and mentor. Arne was an incredible leader, both for Marriott and the industry. And he was fun in a competitive way. Like Leeny I also remember the countless times we ran together and he would always beat me, always. But what I will remember the most about Arne was his humility, his lack of ego and his passion for developing others. Arne and I attended the World Economic Forum in Davos together for the past six years. The first year I attended, I went to everything with Arne taking it all in and learning so much from all of his interactions. The second year we went pretty much as soon as we arrived, he pushed me out of the nest, so to speak. He encouraged me to schedule my own meetings and do my own media interviews. He believed I was ready. And in typical Arne fashion, he empowered me to grow. He knew what was best for me and for the company. That's the true leadership is believing in your team and helping your teammates believe in themselves. I am honored to have worked with him and we are all committed to building on his legacy. I know Arne would want us to talk about business. So let me start this off. COVID-19 has impacted our business to an extent we never imagined making 2020 by far the most challenging year in our company's history. Full year worldwide revPAR declined 60% with average occupancy of just over 35% compared to 73% for full year 2019. In 2020, occupancy and year-over-year revPAR changes showed steady improvement from the trough in April through the summer and into the early fall. However, with spikes in COVID cases in many markets around the world, we saw the global pace of recovery flattened in the fourth quarter, and in the first few weeks of 2021. Currently, over 94% of our hotels are open. Recovery trajectories to date have varied greatly by region. Mainland China, where there has generally been a sense that the virus is under control has led to recovery and strongly exemplifies the resiliency of demand. Occupancy reached 60% in July and remained above that level to the end of 2020. Fourth quarter revPAR in Mainland China was only down 12% year-over-year. We saw additional proof points have the ability for demand to recover quickly in other areas as well during the fourth quarter, including the Maldives and Dubai.  Occupancy in both markets jumped to over 60% in December, after their government's ease travel entry restrictions. In the fourth quarter, many countries around the world reinstituted strict temporary limitations on traveling and gathering to combat rising virus cases. Demand in the US was clearly sensitive to spikes in COVID cases and government travel advisories. As we saw during the traditionally travel heavy holiday period from Thanksgiving through New Year. Many cities in Europe also shut down. Similarly in China, we have recently seen several markets essentially unlocked down in January and February for several weeks at a time in order to fight the spread of the virus, leading to a meaningful drop in occupancy in these markets. Overall occupancy in mainland China year-to-date has fallen to an average of around 40%. The good news is that once these temporary shutdowns are lifted, we have seen demand return quickly. For example, occupancy in Chengdu and Qingdao recently jumped from around 20% to over 60% in just two weeks after their local governments announced the virus outbreaks were under control and remove travel restrictions. Our worldwide occupancy and year-over-year revPAR declined in January were roughly the same as we saw in December. Looking ahead to the rest of 2021, booking windows remain very short, and there is still a large amount of uncertainty. While vaccines are slowly rolling out, the pace is too uncertain to be able to predict when occupancy will move meaningfully higher. But as the year progresses, assuming wider distribution of effective vaccine, we are optimistic that the pace of recovery will pick up speed and accelerate throughout the year. In the US and Canada, we are encouraged to see some small green shoots of increased demand for corporate and leisure transient bookings, as well as in group lead volume. While still down meaningfully year-over-year, transient booking pays and visits to our direct booking sites have been improving recently, occupancy over Presidents Day weekend was the strongest we have had for a long weekend since the beginning of the pandemic led by leisure demand. And we are also starting to see a bit of momentum behind special corporate bookings. Group revenue pays in the US and Canada for 2021 is also still down significantly compared to group revenue pace for 2020 at the same time last year, so the declines are less severe for the second half of the year. In January, we had a very strong month for group bookings in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, this business was booked at average daily rates 11% higher than business booked in January 2020 per stays in 2021 and beyond. These are encouraging signs that there is strong demand for travel in future year once real progress has been made in containing the virus. As we think about marketing in this environment, our teams continue to analyze the latest consumer trends to help shape our recovery strategy. We are keenly focused on personalization and localization on capturing more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur, and on increasingly leveraging our digital direct channels, and in particular, our Marriott Bonvoy app. We recently released our updated redesigned Bonvoy app, with the goal of better meeting the travel shopping needs of today's leisure traveler. The power of the Bonvoy platform has become even more evident during the pandemic, as many of our more than 147 million members has continued to interact with us in ways other than staying in our hotel. Our Marriott Bonvoy credit card holders have remained particularly engaged. Global credit card spending on our cards for 2020 was down only 16% year-over-year, and marked contrast to the steeper decline in revPAR. And while not material from a financial perspective, one of the most significant expanded offerings to members recently has been our whole home rental platform, Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI, we grew the number of units on the platform from around 2,000 at launch less than two years ago to approximately 25,000 today We saw increased demand from our Marriott Bonvoy members with over 90% of HVMI roommates in 2020 booked by members. We continue to focus on driving demand to our hotels, and engaging with our members with creative content and special offers, including our escape to luxury, and Bonvoy escapes promotions. Additionally, early last year, we extended elite member status through early 2022. And we recently credited their accounts with another deposit of elite night credits to give them a head start towards elite status in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Tony, I want to thank our incredible team of associates around the world who have shown true dedication and resilience throughout these challenging times. Tony? Sure, of course, and good morning, Shaun. So as it relates to our group business. We are encouraged to see some really positive trends as I mentioned in the prepared remarks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, our group pace for 2021 it was down negative 57%. But the second half of the year was down just 25% to 30%. We're also on the group front seeing some positive trends as it relates to group canceled; they've really slowed for the second half of 2021. And they are at normal levels for 2022 plus. We're also seeing some great trends on lead volume. While it's certainly behind 2019, it's improving. As a matter of fact, over the last 45 days, lead volume has increased 20 to 30 percentage points. So in a significant improvement from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020. The other thing I note on the group home, we're starting to see a pickup in what I'd call more normal types of groups. So as an example, we're starting to see some incentive meetings book in the fourth quarter of this year. And to your question about rate, yes, January was not only a strong booking month, which was terrific, actually the best month we've had in a couple years, but the rate was up on for futures 11%. And you should know most of those groups that were booked into the future years, those higher rates were in house group versus city wise, we haven't quite seen citywide bookings come back yet. So I think that the story on the group front just underscores the point that there will be a return to meetings and group business and it may be slower than we would like. But we're seeing that we're seeing the demand and as you can imagine, Shaun we are talking to our customers all the time meeting planners our top accounts, and they all want to get back out on the road and on -- and travel. We're also seeing in China some quite positive things on the group front. As a matter of fact, the bookings in China, group bookings were up to 20% of our room nights, again, which was encouraging. China's a great story, it shows that there's pent-up demand for travel. Six weeks after this firework was announced in China, people started booking roommates again, started with leisure, but then quickly towards as the year moved on moved to both business travel and group. And of course, much of it, most of it was domestic, but still strong demand. So we're very encouraged as to what we're saying on the group front. Yes, sure. Absolutely. We are really excited to see are offering them all inclusive properties grow for our consumers on leisure demand is very -- is the strongest segment right now. And it is also leisure is as a segment overall growing even faster than business travel. So we see a lot of runway for continued leisure demand. What we're most excited about with our all inclusive properties is we're going to have on properties across seven of our brands, seven of our premium and luxury brands. And it's going to be a terrific offering particularly for our Marriott Bonvoy members. It is really anything that makes the Marriott Bonvoy programs stickier and more engaging is great for our business. So whether it's growing our all inclusive business, HVMI, of course are terrific leisure properties around the world. We just see the growth of all inclusive is a great proposition for our consumers. Well, so let me help you a little bit here. Thank you, Patrick. And we appreciate your thoughts. So first of all, in US and Canada, we're only talking 3% of the hotels. So only 159 in all of North America, the biggest concentration is in Europe, where 34% of themselves are closed. And then also in Caribbean, Latin America, where 11% of the hotels are closed. So I would say there, there can be some true structural reasons why in those markets, government regulations, actually, in some cases require that the hotels be closed. So I think one of the things that we've all learned over the last year is that in many cases, even down at levels of 10% to 15%, occupancy, a hotel can be better off being open, than it is closed from a cash flow perspective. And we began done everything we can, most of our charges, as you know are based on revenues. So that floats with the occupancy. So I think in general, we would, as you see, things start to pick up a little bit. Hopefully, as the vaccinations continue to progress even more than you will start to see these remaining closed hotels open up. Yes, sure. Absolutely. Yes we always say we're overwhelmingly done with the integration. And we're kind of hopeful that this is the last bid. But when we acquired the company, Starwood management agreements for the Sheraton Grand Chicago in the Western Times Square included very broad cross brand territorial, which actually, when you think about it, that for the rest of our 28 brands, we were severely limited in those areas. So soon after we did the deal, we entered into a settlement agreement with a hotel owner, where basically, we granted that owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in the hotel to Marriott in 2022, for $300 million in cash. Now, it's worth noting that there is a ground lease underneath this hotel, we actually don't have to buy that if we want to buy that land, we'll have the right to for an additional $200 million. But it is worth noting that there is a ground lease on the hotel as well. But this is providing the interest in the hotel. The other interesting part is that, given the current economic conditions, we believe that the put is probable of being exercised. And as a result, we need it to reflect what we think is the current value. And obviously all these markets are struggling. And that resulted in this charge. The other thing that's worth noting is that we actually have the right to not actually close on the put until late 2024. So even though it could get put to us in 2022, we wouldn't necessarily have to buy it until the end of 2024. And so it's actually worth noting that also part of the impairment that we had in the contract amortization line reflects the fact that frankly, right now, if you ask us, we would expect that we would defer that purchase until the end of 2024. And continue to manage the hotel until the end of 2024 to take into consideration the fact that we don't buy it until then. The other part that I guess I'll add is that since that agreement was signed, we've actually added 4,000 rooms in the Chicago and New York markets. So while it is painful, and clearly a direct result of COVID. We do think that in the broad picture, it's really important for us to be able to have the capability to expand our brands and that really important market. Yes. Obviously, you've got to look at that every single quarter. And we would but this was question of a whole lot of different factors as we move over the next few years, but fundamentally, yes, you're right. Great. Well, thank you, Vince for that question. Yes. We really are excited about HVMI primarily as an offering for our Marriott family members. We launched that business in 2019 with about 2,000 homes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and the reason we launched the businesses, we were talking to our Marriott Bonvoy member, an eight out of 10 of them said not only-- not that they were just thinking about renting a home, but they actually had done it through another platform. So we knew it was an offering they wanted that we didn't have. And we knew it would be complimentary to our core hotel business. So we launched the business in 2019, we've grown to 25,000 homes, there is about a couple million homes in the segment in which we play in, I think it's really important when we talk about HVMI to make some distinctions from other platforms. First of all, we only have whole homes. We also, it's not an open platform, like some of the other players; you can't just put a home on there. We only work with professional housing management companies. And we have very, very strict standards about what type of premium and luxury homes will allow on the platform standards around amenities, design aesthetic, service levels, on safety, security, et cetera. So we are very strict about which homes get on the platform. And one of the most important things about HVMI is you can earn loyalty points and burn oil loyalty points there. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks that 90% of our bookings are coming from loyalty members and also 30% of the bookings on redemptions, people are redeeming their Marriott Bonvoy points. And we saw the business do well, particularly during last summer because people wanted a whole home 40% of our HVMI destinations are actually new to Marriott there where we don't have hotels, and many of them are in more remote locations, which really was quite attractive during COVID. So we're excited about the offering and we see it as complimentary to our core business and a tremendous value proposition for Marriott Bonvoy members. Yes, when we look medium, longer term past COVID. We think there is robust demand for travel across all segments, leisure, business travel, group meetings. There could be some slight shifts here and there. But again, as I mentioned, we -- when this disease when COVID gets under control, we see the demand come back. And we're already on the business travel side. We're seeing -- we're starting to see green shoots, our special corporate bookings in January in the month for the month were the best that we've seen since last fall. And when we look at the bookings from our corporate accounts further out, we're seeing them tick up each week, particularly from accounting and consulting firms and technology companies. So again, post COVID we see robust travel demand across all segments, again, could there be some shifts here and there? Yes. But we're quite bullish on the overall outlook. Sure, Chad. I think, this is Stephanie. I'll take that one on pricing. I mean, pricing is really about compression, not trip purpose. And so in normal times, we can get compression from leisure business in our resorts when they're quite busy or special events on and our retail rates, we don't really differ between business and leisure. We do have some negotiated volume discounts for corporate accounts. But the key to pricing really is about occupancy, rebounding. And right now, that's the challenge. I mean in terms of ADR, it fell very steeply in April and May of last year. And that was driven by very low occupancies. And we had caregiver rates in the lake and our hotels, but the occupancy did tick up throughout the year. Of course, it varies market to market. In general, last year, we saw luxury ADR hold up fast with extended stay ADR next and again, it really does get to compression. I think it'll be interesting to watch this recovery. If demand comes back much more quickly than we anticipated, we may be able to grow ADR faster than we did coming out of the last downturn. But again, it's really about -- it's more about impression than it is about a trip purpose."

            "content": "Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. Arne was a remarkable person, and I'm proud to call him a friend and mentor. One of my favorite trips with him sums up how truly special and unique he really was. After we acquired Starwood in 2016, Arne wanted his senior leadership team to do an eight day whirlwind trip around the world. He wanted to visit as many properties as we could to welcome our new associates and show them that the Marriott people first culture was real. And he wanted each of us there with him. As we toured property after property, already made a point to meet as many people as possible, to shake every hand and to look each person he met in the eye. He was so sincere and genuine. He also made sure to spend time with his leadership team outside of these meetings. In particular, I remember one overnight flight to the Middle East. Towards morning, Arne woke us all up and brought us to the lounge in the back of the plane. So we could just spend time together and enjoy each other's company. This was classic Arne. He wanted to build a cohesive team that was not afraid of some spirited debate, truly liked and respected each other. And it worked. Our jobs are infinitely easier because we're all rowing in the same direction. Now being the humble person that he was, I think Arne would say that we need to move on to the business. So let me now talk about our room's growth. In 2020, we added nearly 63,000 rooms worldwide for room's growth of 4.6% on a gross basis. Room openings in the year were impacted by slower construction timelines, and supply chain issues, as well as some owners temporarily waiting to open their hotels due to COVID-19. Asia Pacific was the one region where we open more rooms in 2020 than we did in 2019. Adding over 18,000 rooms with gross room's growth of over 8% versus year in 2019. In China, we recently opened our 50th Hotel in Shanghai, the JW Marriott Shanghai Function, and a phenomenal accomplishment as our international growth continues to strengthen. On a net basis, including deletions of 1.5%, our global distribution grew by 3.1% year-over-year. Deletions were generally in line with the average levels we've seen over the last three years, despite a number of hotels exiting our system for COVID-19 related reasons. While signings for full year 2020 were not as robust as we had expected at the beginning of the year. Our overall pipeline continues to lead the industry totaling over 498,000 rooms at year end. We also benefited from continued momentum in our residential branding business, and had another strong year for residential signings, a testament to the power of our brands. For the full year 2021, assuming progress is made and containing the virus, we expect gross room's growth to accelerate to approximately 6%. While we have seen some delayed construction starts and could continue to see some delays in openings, 46% of our pipeline is already under construction. Additionally, we anticipate benefiting from the backlog of openings that were pushed from 2020 into this year. We also expect to see a meaningful impact from conversions this year, as owners and their lenders seek the incremental top and bottom line benefits from being part of the Marriott system. We are extremely pleased with our recently announced conversion deal in [Cawa] that is expected to add 19 resorts and nearly 7,000 rooms to our all inclusive portfolio. Our biggest deal yet in Cawa, these hotels fit perfectly with our focus on leisure currently the strongest segment of demand. And while they were not in our year end pipeline, these properties are all anticipated to join our system during 2020. Let's now shift to our 2021 outlook. for net room's growth, not including the approximate 100 basis point one time headwind from the 89 Service Properties Trust or SPC mostly limited service hotels that are leaving our system by the end of March, we expect deletions of 1.5% to 2%. That's slightly higher than we have experienced recently, due to the potential for more COVID-19 related exits. Coupled with our gross room's growth expectation, we expect net room's growth of roughly 3% to 3.5%, including the exiting SPC rooms. We have already received interest from multiple owners about new deals in those markets, and look forward to the opportunity to replace many of the first generation limited service SPC hotels with newer product. A key component of our demand recovery strategy is remaining keenly focused on the health and safety of our guests and associates. We first introduced our heightened cleanliness standards in April of last year. Since then, we've been increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such as mobile and web check in, mobile key and mobile chat to reimagine the guest stay experience for this environment. Last month, we began rolling out additional health protocol options for group meetings at certain properties, including on site temperature checks, and providing for COVID testing capabilities. We've also remained focused on working closely with our owner and franchisee community to help them navigate these challenging times and have taken many steps to significantly lower their costs in this environment. These steps include waiving FFE contributions for most hotels with lender concern, reducing certain fixed charges for programs and services and extending the delay on renovations. We are also working with hotels on payment plans when necessary, and we are very pleased that the vast majority of our hotels are paying their bills. I also wanted to acknowledge our associates this morning. They have exemplified the Marriott culture throughout the pandemic. Whether it's looking after first responders, prepping meals for those in needs, or hosting blood drives at our hotels. They are a remarkable team and we could not be more proud. I will now turn the call back over to Leeny to talk about our fourth quarter financials in more detail. Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your kind sentiments, most appreciated. I think as we think about 2021 openings, obviously, we've indicated in our prepared remarks and acceleration to about 6% gross openings. And to state the obvious, there's more limited visibility than we've had into the markets, pre-COVID. But there are a number of factors, I think that give us some measure of comfort that support our guidance. I think number one, we've got about 230,000 rooms under construction around the world as we sit here today. You also heard us talk a little bit about the Sunwing all inclusive projects, adding 7,000 rooms that give us almost 100 basis points of growth in gross openings in 2021. To your point there were a number of hotels under construction last year that had been targeted for 2020 openings, and they slipped principally because of COVID related construction delays and we expect a significant number of those hotels to open in 2021. And then I think the last thing I would say is that while it's certainly early days, we're only 10 or 11 weeks into the year, we're seeing some encouraging signs related to accelerating conversions activity. If you look at the fourth quarter of 2020, about 21% of our signings were conversions. And that was the highest percentage contribution from conversions that we had seen since the first quarter of 2019. And so we did go back and take a look at some previous cycles. And in fact, it's the last peak, we saw conversions spike all the way up to about 24% of total signings. And I think that's quite encouraging as well. The only other thing I would add, Joe is that also gives us some measure of comfort. We've seen from quarter-to-quarter since the pandemic started a relatively steady level of rooms under construction. And obviously, we've shared that with you and each of the quarterly calls. Sure. Thank you, Thomas. I think maybe I'll talk a little bit about all inclusive from a growth and a deal side. And then I might ask Stephanie to chime in from a demand and a leisure perspective. On the transaction side, As we talked about, when we launched into the all inclusive space, it was frustrating for us to see the pace of growth in the all inclusive space, certainly in [Cala] but even in Southeast Asia and some of the Eastern European resort markets and not to have a platform to compete for those opportunities. Since our launch, the market reaction from the development community has been quite significant. I think one of the things that give us so much enthusiasm about the Sunwing announcement, beyond of the fact that it's great, rapid increase in our footprint. It has accelerated the volume of inquiries we're getting about new opportunities, particularly on the conversion side. And Sunwing is a terrific partner for us. They have been in the all inclusive space much longer than we have. And we think it is going to be a very symbiotic relationship where we both have a lot to teach each other. Stephanie, maybe you can chime in with a little bit on leisure demand. Sure. I think there are lots of conversations. I think from where I sit, I'll be surprised if there is a high volume of activity because I think buyer and seller pricing expectations are still out of alignment. And I think there may be some distressed circumstances where transactions occur. But I do think that gap is significant. I will -- we will continue to look and if we see something that makes sense, we'll use the same lens that we've always applied to the evaluation of bolt-on acquisitions. Does it fill a gap for us in terms of either geographic distribution or segment? And are the economics compelling? Also, maybe the last fine point I would put on that not only for individual hotel transactions, but for M&A transactions. The financing markets are challenging at best. And I think that will have some cooling effect potentially on the volume of M&A deals you see in the market. And I think similarly on the second half of your question, these are terrific physical assets. There are some modest renovation requirements. But these are pretty conversion ready assets that we're excited to get into the system and start welcoming of our Bonvoy guest. Thank you, Robin. As I said in response to one of the earlier questions, state the obvious the there's a lot less visibility into the future than we've had prior to the pandemic. I think beyond 2021, we're going to need to get a bit further into the economic recovery. And to see how quickly the financing markets rebound. And how quickly construction starts begin to pick up. As I said, we do have 230,000 rooms under construction. But it is interesting as I talk with our transactors around the world; the good news is we're generally not seeing much in the way of fallout of under construction projects from the pipeline. I think if there's going to be an impact; it will likely be further impact on the length of the construction cycle. And so it's a little tough to know what that looks like in 2022. I am hopeful that in the next couple quarters that visibility will improve a little bit. But I just don't think we've got great visibility beyond 2021 at this point. We agree that's one of the statistics we've been watching. And to your point it's quite encouraging that we've seen such stability in the volume of under construction rooms around the world."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. Like all of you, my heart is very heavy on Arne's passing. I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with such a wonderful and talented leader and to count Arne as a good friend. So many of you have reached out to us with your condolences for his family and for Marriott. And you've shared your fond memories of him. And we've been comforted by your kind words. Stephanie, Tony and I wanted to share a few stories with you about Arne as well this morning. In hospitality business work inherently includes a lot of travel. Those days when Arne was on the road, he would lead an early morning group run around the hotels neighborhood with his many associates as we're interested. As a fellow runner, I would join the crew and watch Arne somehow find a way to spend time with every runner in the group, to run ahead with the quick runners and then run back to the walkers and find a way to connect with each and every person, would ask them about their families, their roles at Marriott, and their points of view about their markets. The run would be over at 6:30. And then he would move on to a full day of meetings and at least five more hotel tours. You could tell he fed on these connections with people and that he cared about them deeply. I've learned so much from him, and I'll miss him tremendously. We're all committed to honoring our incredible leader by building on his legacy. And we of course want to update you on our business this morning as we move the company forward. Today, we will cover our usual earnings called topics with Stephanie focusing on the customer and demand side of the business. And Tony discussing our room's growth and development trends. I'll cover our financial results in liquidity. Given the uncertainty around the pace of vaccinations, and therefore demand recovery, we will not be providing earnings guidance today. We will however, share what we can about our outlook for 2021 and a few key areas. We'll plan to take your questions after our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn it over to Stephanie. Thank you, Tony. In the fourth quarter of 2020, worldwide revPAR declined 64% with occupancy of 35%. As Stephanie noted Mainland China continued to lead the recovery. Leisure remains the strongest driver of demand in Mainland China. And in the fourth quarter stays in the leisure segment were up double digits year-over-year for the second quarter in a row. Business transient group demand in the region also continued to rebound well in the fourth quarter. And we've been pleased to see this evidence of pent-up demand across all travel segments. In fact, group stays comprised around 20% of overall room nights in the fourth quarter back in line 2019 distribution. Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with occupancy reaching 35%, up 10 percentage points from the third quarter, primarily driven by domestic leisure travel in Australia, South Korea and Japan as well as economic reopening efforts in countries like the Maldives and India. In the US and Canada, leisure and drive to destinations remained the strongest markets throughout the fourth quarter. RevPAR declined 65% in the quarter in line with a year-over-year third quarter decline, with occupancy of 35% just below third quarter's level of 37%. The seasonal decline in occupancy that typically happens during the fourth quarter was less pronounced in 2020. Given the overall lower level of business travel. Trends in EMEA were mixed. Fourth quarter occupancy in the Middle East and Africa reached 36%, an 11 percentage point improvement from third quarter, reflecting strong domestic leisure demand in many major markets in the Middle East. The recovery in Europe took a step back in the last few months of 2020 as most countries re-imposed restrictions after major second waves of the virus. During the fourth quarter, roughly one third of our hotels in Europe were temporarily closed and occupancy fell to 15%. In [Cala] around 20% of hotels were closed during the fourth quarter resort properties, particularly in Mexico drove an improvement in occupancy to 24% in the region, up from 15% in the third quarter with global revPAR down 64%, our fourth quarter gross fee revenues totaled $423 million, a decline of 57% versus the year ago quarter, largely in line with the year-over-year decline we saw in the third quarter. Over 60% of the $44 million of fourth quarter incentive management fees were earned in Asia Pacific, of which three quarters were earned in Greater China. Over 95% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in the fourth quarter, with over 90%, generating positive profits for the full year. These results reflect the strong rebounding demand when the virus is under better control and our ability to help our owners control costs. Within franchise fees our non revPAR related franchise fees continued to be resilient, totaling $133 million in the fourth quarter, down 15% from the year ago quarter, with credit card branding fees down 18%. Fourth quarter G&A improved by 31% year-over-year, reflecting our significant cost reduction efforts. In the fourth quarter, our total income tax provision was a benefit of $150 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of pre acquisition Starwood tax audit. We reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $317 million down 65% versus the fourth quarter of last year essentially the same decline as in the third quarter. I'll now turn to cash burn as we've described on prior calls, our monthly cash burn rate was only slightly negative in the fourth quarter even with revPAR down 64%. The impact of the company's $130 million 401-k match payment in October and higher cash interest due to the timing of payments will partially offset by continued strong receivables collection efforts and robust loyalty cash flows. We've been pleased with the strength of our cash generation in 2020 in light of the dramatic reduction in revenues. Our full year financial show net cash provided by operating activities of $1.6 billion, which included the one time $920 million of proceeds from our amended co brand credit card agreements; subtracting out the $920 million as well as all investment spending, we still generated positive operating cash flow, a strong performance in the year when revPAR was down 60%. These results show the true power of our asset light business model, and are a testament to our company's ability to quickly and effectively adapt to a significant and rapid change in demand. Loyalty was a key piece of the equation generating over $500 million of net cash flow in 2020 after being a net user of cash in 2019. This year's positive cash generation from loyalty is on top of our credit card related fees including an EBITDA, as well as the $920 million of cash received from our amended co brand credit card agreements. The loyalty program benefited from strong cash inflows from our credit card programs given the resilience of consumer credit card spending. While the loyalty programs operating cost and redemption expenses were down significantly. Redemption expenses were much lower than usual in terms of both volume of nights, and the rate paid hotels for redemptions given the low occupancy environment. At the end of the fourth quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion after the pay down of over $600 million of debt during the quarter. The company's net liquidity represents roughly $800 million in available cash balances, plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positioned us to meet our short and long-term obligations. I also want to briefly discuss the $243 million fourth quarter charge related to the Sheraton Grand Chicago put shortly after the Starwood deal closed, we granted the hotel owner a one time right to put the leasehold interest in Marriott in 2022 for $300 million in cash. Given the current environment, we have determined the put is likely to be exercised so we increased our liability. We have the right to defer the closing on the put until late 2024. Moving on to full year 2021, while we won't be giving revPAR or earnings guidance, I'll provide a bit of color on certain items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current revPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in revPAR compared to 2019 revPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of revPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 revPAR compared to 2020 revPAR could be more like $15 million to 20 million. As we saw throughout 2020, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMS and the inclusion of non revPAR related franchise fees as well. In order for us to start earning IMS in the US and other markets where IMS stand aside to owner priorities, we'll need to see substantial improvement in revPAR levels. We anticipate that the majority of IMS in 2021 will again be earned in international markets. We expect our non revPAR related fees to remain resilient and show strong year-over-year growth in 2021. We expect G&A to total $775 million to $800 million in 2021. Note that the cash component of G&A will be lower than this range given non cash stock compensation. Interest expenses anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Turning to several other major items that will impact cash flow, our cash taxes are expected to be $275 million to $300 million for full year 2021. Investment spending, excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the full year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time for total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. Approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance CapEx in our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. We expect cash flows from the loyalty program to be roughly neutral in 2021 even after the reduced payments we will receive from the co brand and credit card companies that effectively repay roughly one third of the $920 million received in 2020.  In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we are optimistic that we will see notable progress over the course of this year. We've seen real evidence of the pent-up demand for travel. And we look forward to welcoming more and more guests to our hotels. We will now open the line for questions. And Joe when you think about on the investment front, obviously, as you're adding more rooms on a relative basis to 2020, you see a little bit more investment but when you think about the kind of classic typical investment, either per deal or per average key and a full year, I would say we're not seeing any sort of meaningful increase in the amount of investment that we're needed to put into deals. And obviously, when you look at our pipeline, for example, in the US, which is 80%, limited service they're typically the investment is far less. And so I think while you would expect that our investment will increase a bit relative to the really low 2020 levels, I would not expect it to see it take kind of meaningful step up relative to the overall numbers of rooms. Yes, sure, thanks. So first of all, on the corporate G&A front when you look at these levels, compared to the 2019 levels, you're looking at a high teen reduction in comparison, and you do need to remember that both of those numbers include bad debt. And while in the long run bad debt is a cash cost, it is kind of in the year for the year often not a cash cost, because it's a reserve taken. And again, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly where that'll go in 2021. I think you would normally expect in this environment, it might be a little bit higher than normal levels. And certainly in 2019, it was not even anything to worry about. But overall, I would say from a cash perspective, you would see that our cash costs on a G&A front with this $775 million to $800 million is that reduction is a bit higher than the high teens sort of number that I've described on the expense line. And when I think about it going forward, Steven, I would say a couple things. First of all, obviously, I would expect that some will need to be added back as we move forward into a much improved picture for our industry. But I will also say that we undertook some work in 2020. That was while extraordinarily painful and difficult, I think was a reflection that we view that it will take some time for the industry to recover. And we really need to put ourselves in a position where we could make these cost savings last a very long time, if not permanently. So while you could see costs go up more than inflation, I think you will see most of these savings be sustainable. And similarly on the hotel front we've done a lot of work to do things that are both temporary and sustainable on the cost front. We've obviously done some temporary reductions in fixed costs at the hotel level; we've obviously done some again really painful work in the way of furloughs, et cetera. But we've also done some really innovative things around how to better staff the hotels how to better get our work done, how to manage some of the programmatic costs that go to the hotels. And I think those, again will be sustainable. When I think about in 2021, what we've tried to do is gone to as much of the margins that we had in 2019 as possible. So while I think the hotel margins will obviously suffer from a reduction in revenues compared to 2019, at the hotel level, we did we think we have been able to save the vast majority of that margin decline through the work that we've done. And then obviously, as we move into a much more normal picture, there will be sustainable savings that allow us to get to a profitability point that returns back to where it was much quicker. Sure. I talked the question before about some substantive work that we've done to try to match the cost with the revenue decline in the short term, and again, try to make a bunch of it sustainable, but overwhelmingly, our owners are paying us and we've had tremendous success in collecting our receivables. Most hotels have reopened. And obviously, amongst the select service hotels, quite a few of them are actually cash flow positive. We have arranged payment plans for a large number of our hotels. And when you think about it typically, Smedes, they pay us in 30 days, and to be able to stretch that out over several months is a big help. And we're seeing there, again, overwhelmingly that they are making payments on those payment plans. And while they're obviously we need to get back to where there's substantial recovery to get them to a much better spot. For the moment, they are hanging in there, and they are able to pay some down and work with us to be able to navigate through this time. But I do agree with you, we are paying incredible attention to our costs on property and working with the owners to try to find ways to do even more. And a lot of this depends on what the owner's particular situation is too in terms of how well capitalized, what is the debt structure, and what kind of market they're in. But overwhelmingly, we have seen really strong performance and the newest information about the PPP loan extension and expansion, as well as whatever may come from a stimulus bill, hopefully will be added benefit to them as well. Well, I'll take the first one. And then I'm going to turn it over to Tony for the second one. And we would never get into specifics on a particular deal. But I can tell you that this was a very, very capital light deal. I'll just leave it there. No, I don't think so. I think obviously, the stability of the marketplace will be important. I am kind of assuming that we continue on the beginnings of this recovery and get to a much more stable place. I think we clearly have to recognize that it will take us a little while to get back to where our leverage ratios or where we want them to be. And we will need to be considering whether the market is as stable as it was from 2012 through 2019. When you think about the volatility of our cash flows, but I think broadly speaking, looking at our business model, and the way we generate cash, that I think the fundamental strategy is still the same, which is grow absolutely the best way we can, with really efficient use of capital, resulting in a business model that generates significant excess cash over and above what we need to reinvest in the business. And in that respect, we would look forward to returning to both modest dividends and share repurchase. Thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining this morning. We can't wait to see you out on the road. And thank you again so much for your kind thoughts. Take care."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star, one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, press star, zero. I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Arne Sorenson, President and CEO. Thank you, please go ahead.\nArne Sorenson: Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President, Investor Relations. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements made in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actually events unfold.  Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our REVPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Before I talk about the quarter, I want to again thank our incredible team of associates around the world who continue to work tirelessly and show true resilience during these challenging times. The power of the Marriott culture has never been more evident and I am incredibly grateful. I hope everyone joining us today is staying safe and well. While COVID-19 is still significantly impacting our business, our third quarter results showed meaningful improvement versus the second quarter. Third quarter worldwide REVPAR declined 66%, almost 19 percentage points better than last quarter\u2019s decline. Globally 94% of our hotels are now open with 97% open in North America. Our worldwide occupancy levels improved each month during the quarter and continued to close the gap to last years. We saw a steady climb in demand through August and then the rate of improvement began to plateau towards the end of the quarter in most regions; however, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made since the trough in April.  In September, our global occupancy reached just over 37%, an improvement of 25 percentage points from April\u2019s 12%. Worldwide REVPAR in September declined 64% versus September of last year, over 25 percentage points better than the year-over-year decline in April. The recovery trajectories have differed greatly by region. The recovery in Greater China, especially in mainland China, has been the strongest. Results have improved meaningfully since February, demonstrating the resiliency of travel when the virus is perceived to be firmly under control. Occupancy in mainland China reached 67% in September, a bit ahead of occupancy in September of last year and an extraordinary improvement from 9% occupancy in February.  In 2019, around 75% of room nights in mainland China were sourced from domestic guests. Even with strict travel entry requirements limiting visitors from outside the mainland, demand has rebounded strongly across all segments. Leisure transient bookings in the third quarter were over 25% ahead of last year\u2019s bookings, helped by domestic travelers taking more trips inside the country. Business transient and group bookings have strengthened each month since February solely from domestic meetings and events but are still lagging a bit compared to last year. Hong Kong and Macau, which are reliance on visitors from the mainland, are recovering more slowly as travel restrictions are easing, but cumbersome entry procedures are still inhibiting demand.  Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific has also continued to improve but generally at a much slower pace. Countries are in various stages of reopening with many still imposing strict travel restrictions. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines continue to drive performance, helped by quarantine business for travelers entering those countries. In North America, where 95% of room nights in 2019 were sourced from domestic travelers, results in the third quarter were also meaningfully better than the second quarter, though the rate of improvement did slow in September. Third quarter REVPAR declined 65% versus the third quarter of last year with occupancy reaching 37%.  During the quarter, all chain scales continued to show improvement versus the second quarter, although there were still large variations among hotels and markets. Drive-to leisure demand continued to lead the recovery, particularly for extended stay and resort hotels and for properties in secondary and tertiary markets. Business transient and group bookings in the quarter picked up modestly versus the second quarter but still remain significantly lower versus last year. The improvement in demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA, has also been slower than in North America and China. In the last few weeks, rising numbers of cases in many countries in Europe and CALA have led governments to re-impose or extend lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing regulations. These measures discourage international travelers, who made up about 40% of Europe\u2019s room nights and about 60% of CALA\u2019s room nights in 2019.  Compared to CALA and Europe, demand trends have been a bit better in the Middle East and Africa, where international guests have historically made up around 50% of room nights. Certain resort properties in Turkey, the UAE and Qatar were particularly strong in the quarter. Currently 20% of hotels are closed in CALA, 26% of hotels are closed in Europe, and 9% are closed in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, the plateauing of demand that we saw towards the end of the third quarter has generally continued into the first few weeks of the fourth quarter. Occupancy levels in most regions have remained relatively in line to slightly better versus September levels, which were marginally ahead of occupancy levels in August.  Booking windows remain very short and visibility is still limited; nonetheless, we do expect an easier year-over-year REVPAR comparison in the fourth quarter given our historical seasonality. We usually see a substantial step down in occupancy around the world in November and December as compared to September and October due to the holidays and relatively less business travel.  In 2019, global occupancy was around five percentage points lower in November than October, and then December occupancy was another eight percentage points lower than November. This year with the leisure segment showing the strongest demand, we could see occupancy levels throughout the fourth quarter remain relatively flat with September and October. As a result, year-over-year REVPAR comparisons could look better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third. Of course, as we have seen to date, results vary greatly by region and can change quickly, and the recent virus resurgences in numerous countries could have a dampening effect on demand. We know the road to recovery is going to take some time; however, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making across a number of key operational and financial areas. One of the biggest operational adjustments has been our heightened cleanliness standards. The health and safety of our associates and guests remains a top priority. Throughout the pandemic, we have adjusted our protocols to elevate our cleanliness guidelines and tools, and every property across our portfolio is now required to complete a monthly commitment to clean certification. By increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such a mobile and web check-in, mobile key and mobile chat, we are re-imagining the guest stay experience while also amplifying operational efficiencies. We also continue to roll out innovative targeted phased in marketing strategies. Our messaging emphasizes our heightened cleaning guidelines and safety measures while appealing to evolving consumer sentiment and travel intent. Many of our recent creative offerings, such as Fall for Travel and our October Week of Wonders, have been very successful in sparking leisure demand, and at the end of October we announced our new Work from Anywhere packages, which are designed to capture additional revenue driven by the remote work trend. Our award-wining loyalty program underpins all of our marketing strategies and we remain focused on engaging with our 145 million Marriott Bonvoy members, including those who are not yet ready for a hotel stay. We have also been highlighting non-hotel stay experiences such as Eat Around Town and Homes and Villas by Marriott International, and in collaboration with American Express and Chase we have been offering numerous grocery and retail spending accelerators and limited time offers on our co-branded credit cards. The increased demand amongst our Bonvoy members for our homes and villas whole home rentals during the pandemic and a much more modest decline in Chase and Amex Bonvoy card spend compared to the decline in REVPAR are great indicators of the value of the Bonvoy program to our customers. Another key constituency is our owner and franchisee community. We have had an unprecedented level of engagement with them this year, including weekly webinars in many regions and more frequent interactions with our owner advisory committees. We are deeply committed to working closely together to manage through these challenging times. We remain focused on reducing their costs as much as possible in this environment, as Leeny will discuss during her remarks. On the development front, we now anticipate net rooms growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2020, the high end of our expectation from a quarter ago, reflecting strong openings in the third quarter. This takes into account 1.5% to 2% deletions which is around 50 basis points higher than we estimated in February, primarily due to certain hotels that were already struggling entering 2020 deciding to close permanently due to COVID-19. Given the current fluid environment, we have more uncertainty than usual on opening dates for many hotels nearing completion, but the good news is that 46% of our almost 500,000 room pipeline is currently under construction with rooms under construction up 6.5% from a year ago. Although signings are not as strong as in 2019, they are quite solid considering the extraordinary impact of COVID-19 on our industry. We believe that many of the rooms that do not open in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 will now likely open in 2021. The pace of openings will likely vary depending on the recovery of lodging demand in specific markets, with heightened uncertainty in markets where air lift is key. We are also encouraged by the increasing number of conversations we are having around conversions. We remain keenly focused on conversion opportunities that are accretive from both a brand and a financial value perspective. Assuming progress is made in containing the virus, we would expect our gross room additions to accelerate next year compared to our expectations for 2020. We are in the middle of developing our 2021 budget so it is too soon to give a definitive outlook for room deletions for the coming year. It is worth noting that the potential 2021 exit of the 89 hotels owned by Service Properties Trust, which are almost all limited service properties, would create a short term headwind of roughly 1% in net rooms growth, but we are confident in our ability to replace many of those first generation limited service hotels with brand-new updated product. Finally, as Leeny will discuss in a moment, we have made significant strides in shoring up our financial position to weather the crisis. While the recovery is going to take longer than anyone would like, we are seeing encouraging signs that demand can be extremely resilient. With the steps we have taken for our customers and owners, the power of Marriott Bonvoy, our strength and liquidity position, and our incredible team of associates around the world, I am confident that we are very well positioned now and for the future. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Leeny Oberg, our CFO.\nLeeny Oberg: Thanks Arne very much. I hope all of you on the call are staying safe and well. I\u2019d also like to thank our team of associates for their incredible work this year in making sure Marriott comes through this crisis strong and healthy.  In the third quarter with global REVPAR down 66%, our gross fee revenues totaled $397 million, a decline of 58% versus the year ago quarter. Gross fees were comprised of base management fees of $87 million, franchise fees of $279 million, and incentive management fees, or IMFs, of $31 million. Seventy-five percent of IMFs in the quarter were earned at hotels in the Asia Pacific region where contracts generally have no owners priority.  Over 90% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in September with almost three quarters generating positive profit for the first nine months of the year. These results are a reflection of the strong rebound in demand and our ability to help our owners control costs. With franchise fee, our non-REVPAR related franchise fees were again much more resilient, totaling $119 million in the third quarter, down 18% from the year ago quarter with credit card fees down 22%.  Third quarter G&A improved by 40% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a full quarter of the difficult but necessary steps we took earlier this year in response to COVID-19. These steps included furloughs, reduced work weeks, and meaningful cuts in executive compensation. As REVPAR has improved from the global trough experienced in April, corporate and above property furloughs and reduced work weeks generally ended by late September. Of course, REVPAR is still well below 2019 levels and expected to take some time to fully recover. With that in mind, we focused on restructuring our organization to reduce costs on a more sustainable basis at the corporate and above property level, as well as at the hotel level so we can operate more efficiently today and going forward.  Our restructuring efforts are anticipated to reduce total corporate and other above property controllable costs by 25%, in line with the expectation we noted last quarter. This includes both classic corporate G&A as well as programs and services we provide to the hotels, for which we are reimbursed. We are still working through our budget and exact allocations for 2021, but based on our preliminary estimates we expect total corporate G&A costs in 2021 could be around 20% lower than our original 2020 guidance of $950 million to $960 million, with expenses for reimbursable programs and services down well over 25%. Importantly, we expect the reduction in G&A to be largely sustainable subject to wage and inflationary increases.  We reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $327 million, down 64% versus the third quarter of last year and a significant improvement from adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year. We do have a couple headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter adjusted EBITDA. As we have mentioned, G&A savings will not be as large as in the third quarter with the return of our workforce to full time, and the fourth quarter is a seasonally slower quarter.  At the hotel level, as part of our cost mitigation efforts we conducted a thorough review of all reimbursable programs and services in order to reduce the associated costs to our hotels. This work went beyond the naturally lower fees charged in this environment given that the majority of bill is based on a percent of hotel revenues. Our work has led to significantly lower expenses for the hotels. While some savings are volume related given fewer associates, transactions and the like, others reflect a real reduction in program rates. For example, after providing a discount this year on certain fixed mandatory fees paid by all of our hotels around the world, we have worked to provide a meaningful discount on these same fees in 2021 as well. Of course, we have also significantly cut our expenses associated with providing programs and services given the lower expected levels of reimbursements from the hotels. As we noted last quarter, we\u2019ve been able to reduce breakeven profitability rates at our managed properties by three to five percentage points of occupancy. As you might imagine, we are applying this same disciplined approach to our owned and leased properties as well. We have also been allowing owners to access FF&E reserves for working capital and have extended the waiver of required funding of these FF&E funds through the end of March 2021, with lender consent where applicable. Additionally, we worked with our U.S. managed hotels to file for CARES Act tax credits which led to refunds of $119 million, which should help support our hotels\u2019 working capital position.  These measures combined with our aggressive collection efforts have been quite effective. The vast majority of our owners and franchisees continues to pay their bills on time or are on short term payment plans. Despite the current environment, only a small number of hotels have gone into foreclosure this year as lender have been relatively patient to date, and with only a handful of exceptions, the few hotels that are in foreclosure or receivership are retaining our flag. In North America, our management and related agreements generally protect us and historically we have held onto most franchise agreements as well when properties go into foreclosure. Last quarter, we laid out a cash burn scenario with REVPAR down 70% that indicated a monthly cash burn rate of around $85 million, or $255 million a quarter at that REVPAR decline. Our actual cash burn for the third quarter was around flat, much better than the model would have shown even including severance payments of around $60 million in the quarter that were not included in the model. We were pleased that total fees came in higher than our $2 million to $2.5 million of monthly fees per REVPAR point sensitivity would have predicted, with REVPAR for the quarter down 66% primarily due to higher incentive management fees. The other major drivers of our neutral cash burn were better owned lease results, lower G&A costs, strong working capital management, and robust loyalty program cash flows. The model we provided last quarter should still be useful as we think about potential monthly cash burn in the fourth quarter, with a couple updates. We still expect the sensitivity of a one-point change in REVPAR on our fees would be in the $2 million to $2.5 million per month range. As we\u2019ve seen, the sensitivity is not completely linear given the variability of IMFs and does not include impact of changes in credit card fees. We expect that continued strong collections of receivables should again help minimize our working capital outlays in the fourth quarter.  Investment spending for the full year is now expected to be slightly below the low end of our prior expectation of $400 million to $450 million and significantly below our original forecast of $700 million to $800 million at the beginning of the year. This is another example of the strong progress we have made in reducing cash outlays in the current environment. The variance versus last quarter\u2019s expectation is primarily due to the timing of key money payments and additional reductions in systems spending.  There are also two timing-related items to highlight which will impact our cash flow in the fourth quarter. In October, our working capital was impacted by the funding of our 2019 company match to associates\u2019 401k plan contributions, which totaled around $130 million. That payment usually occurs earlier in the year. Also, cash interest payments will be roughly $100 million higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter due to the timing of when the payments are due. Through the first three quarters of 2020 with year-over-year REVPAR down an unprecedented 59% through September 30, we have demonstrated our ability to adapt quickly and we\u2019ve confirmed the power of our asset-light business model. Our cash from operations less capital expenditures has been positive year to date. At the end of the third quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion, representing roughly $1.5 billion in available cash balances plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. The substantial increase in liquidity from the prior quarter reflects our August $1 billion bond issuance maturing in 2032. Most of those proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our revolver balance. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positions us to meet our short and long term obligations. In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we\u2019re confident that COVID-19 will eventually be contained and that travel will come back quickly. We look forward to welcoming new and returning guests to our hotels before too long. Thank you for your time this morning, and we\u2019ll now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone.\nArne Sorenson: Hey Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Hi Arne. Just to start off, you covered a lot of ground in the prepared remarks, so thank you for all that. Could we hit on the net unit growth commentary for next year a little bit more deeply? Arne, I think you talked about a couple of the puts and takes around the SVC terminations being a bit of a drag, but what else could factor in, and just broadly speaking, do you expect to see some level of maybe elevated terminations relative or system exits relative to past behavior, just given the environment we\u2019re in, or do you think these kind start to normalize? And in this comment, could you give any thoughts around particularly just maybe the health and status of the Starwood legacy portfolio? Thank you.\nArne Sorenson: All right, well there\u2019s a lot in that, and let me start maybe by saying it\u2019s still a little early, obviously. There is a lot of uncertainty out there because of the pandemic. I think we were pleased to see in Q3 the increase in openings again compared to Q2. I think Q2, to some extent, even as projects were ready to reopen, either restrictions precluded it or the total lack of business precluded it, or just the uncertainty in the environment precluded to it. So to get to about 19,000 rooms opening in Q3, I think is a sign that at least for projects that are under construction and nearing completion, those will open, and I think that\u2019s what gives us the most optimism about not just Q4 but looking into 2021, that we should see - obviously all of this depends on the virus, but that we should see these projects that are under construction open as scheduled, if you will, over the course of the next couple of years, something like that, but very much including 2021. The deletion side of the equation is harder, and of course there\u2019s an offsetting potential upside, which is conversions. Both depend a little bit on what happens with properties are under trouble and what happens with change in ownership or change in capital structure for existing hotels. Some of what we\u2019ve lost year to date, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, are hotels that entered the COVID-19 pandemic already under financial pressure and simply did not make sense to reopen, certainly not to reopen under their current positioning. I suspect we\u2019ll see some that next year. Besides SVC, we don\u2019t have a number for it yet - we\u2019re obviously just in the process of trying to build our budget. Our teams are dealing with owners all around the world. I think by and large on the positive side, conversions into our system and on the negative side deletions from our system will become clearer as ownership of hotels change hands or as the new capital stacks are put in place, and I suspect that will begin to occur more in 2021 than it is doing right now.\nShaun Kelley: Thanks, and maybe just as a follow-up on the same topic, are there a large number of these sort of--let\u2019s call it cross, single guarantee type contracts out there? Is the SVC situation pretty unique? Just any color you can provide on those types of structures.\nArne Sorenson: Yes, SVC is very unusual. Those portfolios were initially put in place with HPT 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago, something like that, and they were initially a lease structure or a lease-like structure. They\u2019ve evolved since to be sort of a management structure but with a cap guarantee. That structure was re-done with SVC earlier this year. We were quite optimistic that actually it was done in a way that would bode well for long term, including getting substantial additional new capital into those assets to bring them up to standard, and of course the pandemic had profound impact to that. We are in discussions with SVC today about the possibility of renewing that. I think based on what we heard, including as recently as yesterday from that team, they seem to be hard wired to make those hotels Sonestas. We of course don\u2019t know exactly how Sonesta would perform, but looking at the ROI from assets that are Sonesta flag versus ours, it looks like that ROI is roughly half, and it\u2019s a little bit surprising to us that the separate stockholder and debt holder interest in SVC could be furthered by converting those to Sonesta\u2019s brand, as opposed to the dramatically stronger brands that are on those hotels today.  But again, that seems to be the direction they\u2019re heading, and so our expectations would be that those hotels would leave the system. We do not think there is anything comparable to that, that remains in the system.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you for all the clarity.\nArne Sorenson: You bet.\nLeeny Oberg: It\u2019s also just worth noting one addition, that when you think about the impact on fees, it\u2019s quite minimal related to that portfolio. I think total fees in 2020 this year are expected to be $10 million to $15 million from those hotels.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan.\nJoe Greff: Good morning everybody.\nLeeny Oberg: Hey Joe.\nJoe Greff: Arne, you mentioned in your comments for next year in terms of gross room additions, for that to accelerate next year, and part of that confidence is some of the rooms that would have opened in 2020 were being pushed out to open in 2021. To what extent are the ones that you would have thought a year ago to open in 2021 will be pushed out to beyond 2021, into 2022, and does that room addition acceleration comment from you take that into account? Is there typically visibility in stuff that gets pushed out, so if something wouldn\u2019t hit in \u201921 right now, would Marriott in November of 2020 have a good sense of that?\nArne Sorenson: Yes, it\u2019s a fair question. I think generally we would say that everything in that pipeline has gotten extended by at least a few months. Undoubtedly that\u2019s a little bit of an overstatement, but when we deal with--think about the end of the first quarter and the second quarter of this year, with business sort of functionally disappearing in many markets around the world, including restrictions on lots of activity that is happening in those markets, the uncertainty and those restrictions certainly caused many, many, many projects to slow down, even if they were already under construction, so I think it\u2019s a fair point to say that if in January of 2020, we targeted a June of 2021 opening, that opening could well have slipped by a few months. We do have a team that is out there working with our development partners and trying to make sure they understand what is under construction and what the status of that construction and what the forecasted opening is, for obvious reasons. I think on the very positive side here, the 45% or so of the rooms that are in the pipeline that are under construction, 230,000 rooms roughly, we can all have an extraordinarily high level of confidence that those hotels are going to open. I think you get beyond that to the hotels that are not under construction yet and I think we\u2019re going to have to watch that. I think they are real projects, in many respects the land is owned and controlled, they\u2019ve been designed, they\u2019ve been improved by us and by our partners. We have signed contracts for the overwhelming majority of them, but if construction hasn\u2019t started, each one of those partners has got to make a decision about what do I get for building in a weaker environment, which I might save something on construction costs, and what do I potentially lose in committing myself to a project that may open in a market that is harder for me to predict and underwrite today. Our experience from prior crises is that most of the projects which are not under construction overwhelmingly will ultimately open, but the delay in those openings could be not just some quarters, but some years, particularly for the higher end luxury or full service projects that may take some time to get financed and get underway.  So on balance, I think we would say we can have a reasonably high level of confidence that the gross openings will step up next year - again, this is based on reasonable assumptions on what happens with COVID-19, but it\u2019s a little bit too soon for us to give you really precise numbers about it.\nJoe Greff: That\u2019s helpful. Then as a follow-up, Leeny, your mutual cash burn in 3Q was impressive, and you mentioned working capital management was a contributor to the EBITDA upside. To what extent do you think working capital be a source of-a positive contribution to cash flow, operating cash flow, free cash flow next year?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, one of the big questions is around loyalty. If you remember, Joe, last year we actually had loyalty as a use of cash relative to strong redemptions throughout the system, and this year it\u2019s kind of a bit of the opposite. Now, the reality is I actually would expect next year that that stabilizes a bit as we continue to rebound from the low levels of demand that we are, so that while I would expect meaningfully more redemptions, they won\u2019t be quite at the same peak prices that they were in 2019. From that perspective, I would expect that loyalty is not as large a source of cash as this year, but also not like 2019 either. When I think about it overall, we\u2019re still early days as we go through the budgeting process, but I would not see it as a major source but also not a major use of cash next year, as we think about from a working capital perspective.\nJoe Greff: Thanks guys. Have a great day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about, you know, some of your owners have talked about saving--permanent cost reductions from changing brand standards. I just wonder if you can talk about how permanent is that really, because right now, okay, you don\u2019t need a doorman on duty or you don\u2019t need a 24-hour shuttle to the airport, but won\u2019t those come back, so how permanent are they really? Also, when you have 30 brands, do you lose some of what distinguishes the brands if some of those brand standards do change permanently?\nArne Sorenson: Good question, Robin, and good morning. I think what we want to do is have as many of the savings as we\u2019ve been able to find and implement be long lasting, to state the obvious. I think there are some, and your question illustrates a few of them. I mean, food and beverage service, I think would be one that\u2019s on the top of my list, maybe even before a doorman. We have, particularly in the markets in which demand is the weakest, we have fairly limited, sometimes dramatically limited food and beverage service, and that\u2019s not going to be satisfactory to most guests when we get back to a normal demand environment. Guests can be quite sympathetic and empathetic during a tough, tough time, but when we get back to something that feels a little bit more normal, they\u2019re going to expect the full services, particularly from a full service hotel that they have come to anticipate.  Having said that, I think we will see some things in keyless entry, I think we will see some things in the staffing models that we have been experimenting with. I think some of the above property costs that have been cut, and Leeny can talk a little bit about that, we think will stick and stay for a while. I mean, our estimates today, I think are--we\u2019ve probably reduced breakeven occupancy by three to five points, something like that, depending on the brand.  At the end of the day, though, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the guest is satisfied with the experience that they\u2019re getting, and you\u2019re right - it\u2019s going to vary a little bit from brand to brand and segment to segment. Obviously the advantages, of course, on the higher end segment is we\u2019ll see rate begin to move at some point up too, even as the costs move forward a little bit.  Net-net, we\u2019d expect that what we\u2019ve done should deliver some long lasting margin improvement. It\u2019s a little too soon to be able to tell you what that number will be.\nRobin Farley: Then maybe just as a quick follow-up on the conversation about conversion, I know in the release you mentioned the percent of conversions, 1,400 out of the 19,000 rooms opened, so still a pretty small percent because obviously that was all pre-COVID. Can you talk about the signings in the quarter, what percent of those are conversions, and did you see that go up during the quarter for signings? Thanks.\nArne Sorenson: Yes, I don\u2019t have that number. I know that the team is talking, having significantly more conversations around conversions than they\u2019ve had in the past. The one quarter signings don\u2019t necessarily make a huge amount of difference - I\u2019m aware of a few significant ones that are underway now and the team of transactors that are working on them are hoping that they get done in the fourth quarter. Whether that happens or not, of course, is another question. We\u2019ve gone back and looked at our conversions experience through the cycles - obviously we knew this is of interest not just to you but to us as well, and you can see even in the last two years before COVID, we had--of our openings in 2019, 18% were conversions, but the year before in 2018, it was 12%, and so you can see a little bit the obvious fact here, which is even in a very similar economic environment, these things can be a little bit lumpy and a little bit hard to predict. We\u2019re in the teens for most of the last decade or so, and conversions as a percentage of our openings were highest coming out of the Great Recession - \u201911 was higher than \u201910, \u201912 was higher than \u201911, \u201913 was higher than \u201912, and as a percentage they peaked in \u201913 but the number of rooms we opened as conversions in 2014 was higher yet again.  Again, this is what we said before, but we would expect conversion activity to increase certainly in terms of discussions starting now. We would expect that the more substantial increase in terms of actually opening into our system will depend a bit on the new ownership structures or financial structures for hotels that caused those folks to be able to look to the future and say, I now know what I want to do with that hotel.\nRobin Farley: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with SunTrust Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi, good morning everyone. With the layoffs in corporate level sales staff and also property level sales staff, should we interpret that as your belief that it\u2019s going to be a long, slow recovery for your group business, and also related to that, how is your group business tracking for next year? Thank you.\nArne Sorenson: Our group business for next year is down about 30%. It won\u2019t surprise you to know that the first quarter is the worst by far in terms of group business on the books, and as you get farther into the year, the decline is meaningfully less than that 30% number. What does that tell you? It tells you that folks are still optimistic about holding their meetings, that COVID-19 will allow them to hold their meetings as you get further into 2021. I think we are optimistic, as are many, that we can have a vaccine or two, maybe, approved by the end of this calendar year, and could see it start to get broadly distributed by sometime in the first half, maybe it\u2019s the latter part of the first half, but sometime in the first half of 2021. As that takes hold, we\u2019re optimistic that group business will come back. I think what we\u2019re seeing in group today, and I think you\u2019ve heard this from other companies in the industry, there is group business. Obviously it\u2019s stronger in China, but coming back to the United States for a second, the group business in hotels in the United States is not a lot like the group that I think we all first think of, which is corporate group and association business and the like. I think the group business we have today is much more likely to be healthcare workers or somehow connected with the COVID-19 pandemic itself, or things that are more leisure focused - that could be some athletic groups, it could be some larger family groups, that sort of thing. The core corporate business is still pretty weak. I don\u2019t think you should read too much into the efforts we\u2019ve made to manage our costs in the sales space. Obviously those costs are borne by the system of hotels that are out there. We have got to make sure that we\u2019re managing those costs in a way that meets the level of reimbursement that can come in there, and we\u2019re doing our best to do that and to make sure we continue to call on the customers that we know are important to us and important to the recovery. We\u2019d be optimistic, I think, if COVID-19 goes the way we think, that we will start to see this group business that\u2019s on the books hang tight and ultimately come to pass, and we\u2019ll start to see meaningfully more bookings when those vaccines start to take effect.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, thank you. I certainly hope so. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Grambling: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  I just had a bit more of a strategic question related to the loyalty program. You\u2019ve mentioned the strength in Bonvoy and corresponding credit cards. What are you learning from how consumer are engaging with the program in this difficult time that could drive changes to further differentiate the brand in a recovery, and potentially even lead to stronger conversions and/or development in the future?\nArne Sorenson: Conversions and development - you\u2019re talking about hotel development, or back to credit cards and the Bonvoy program?\nSteven Grambling: I mean, it\u2019s really all together because I feel like if you\u2019re creating additional value and differentiation for the consumer, ultimately that drives stronger REVPAR and development opportunities in the future.\nArne Sorenson: Yes, well I think we mentioned a bit of this in the prepared remarks, that we\u2019ve been actually quite pleased with the performance of the credit card portfolio during this crisis. It\u2019s probably worth starting with that because you would wonder about how well that would do, an Affinity card for travel in a market in which there is very little travel. But what we\u2019ve seen is that folks are still aspiring to travel, dreaming about travel, eager to get back on the road, and as a consequence when we\u2019ve with our credit card partners done things around grocery or done things around restaurants or around hardware, the card has performed extraordinarily well. The Bonvoy membership, I think, has continued to engage with us in a way that\u2019s pretty powerful.  I think if you go back to before the pandemic, what we saw was a continued increase year-over-year on the number of Bonvoy members as a percentage of the total business in our hotels, and one of the frustrating things, we talked about this a quarter ago, about the timing of this pandemic is as we got into the second half of 2019 particularly, the Starwood integration work was behind us, the systems work was behind us, the new Bonvoy program was launched and we could see, whether it was in REVPAR index or in loyalty penetration or other data we look at very carefully, really powerful momentum towards proving the value of those programs. I don\u2019t have any doubt that we will get back to that. It will come back stronger, obviously, the sooner people get back on the road and know that travel is going to be a part of the way they live their lives, but when they do, they will find that they\u2019ve got a credit card program, they\u2019ll find that they\u2019ve got a broad portfolio of destinations to stay at - we have the biggest portfolio of hotels around the world, clearly the strongest in the luxury and lifestyle and resort and urban space, plus other things like Eating Around Town and Homes and Villas and other things that we still are working on and hope to get launched before too long.\nLeeny Oberg: The only other thing I\u2019d add, Steven, is the digital experience. If you think about travelers today, if they are traveling, the contactless element of the experience is all the more important, and that is all driven through the Bonvoy app, so as you see more and more people signing up for that experience, that again gets them more invested and they really have an opportunity to see what Bonvoy can do for you.\nSteven Grambling: Makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. I guess one unrelated follow-up on just at the hotel level from a profitability standpoint, what are you learning from reopened hotels that can inform when incentive management fees could come back in fuller force in North America?\nArne Sorenson: Leeny, you want to take that?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. Again, I think the reality is that we are in a position now where, in many cases, you\u2019ve got for a full service hotel, it is better to be open than closed, not in all cases but in most cases, but that is really about what is the least bad, so we\u2019re still a very long way from obviously occupancy levels that get us to IMFs, because overwhelmingly in the U.S. you\u2019ve got owners priorities. But at the same time, I\u2019ll say with the reduction in cost structure, that I do think that it will help us as we come back to get to incentive fees earlier than perhaps we were before COVID, because of all the work that we\u2019ve done on the cost structure.  I think the other side of that is obviously wage pressures, and I don\u2019t see any sign of those actually going away. I think what we obviously have done is try across every single discipline of our hotels to improve our efficiency and to improve ways that can drive more to the bottom line, so I do think it\u2019s certainly that we will hold onto a bunch of these savings in a sustainable way, but I think the wage pressure element on a full service hotel is obviously going to be--you know, with those being, call it 40% of your cost structure of a hotel, that\u2019s going to be a big element of how quickly we get back.\nSteven Grambling: Helpful, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that business travel in China has lagged leisure despite the virus being under much greater control there. Is there anything to read into from that in terms of the potential recovery in the U.S. or other markets?\nArne Sorenson: No, I don\u2019t think so. Obviously we talked about occupancy being higher than it was a year ago, and so that\u2019s a really good sign; but beneath that total, you\u2019ve got two things that are happening. One is that business transient travel and group travel is still a bit softer than it was last year, and the second is you\u2019ve got the Chinese travel business that used to go abroad staying home, which is driving those leisure numbers meaningfully higher. Remember we had in February 9% occupancy in China, a country entirely shut down, and even today now we have occasionally a flare-up in a market in which the Chinese government response is to essentially shut down that market and test everybody in the market for COVID-19, and they\u2019ve managed at least in two or three circumstances to nip that in the bud, if you will, and get those markets reopened and get going again.  They have had an impact to us, probably less than a point or so on REVPAR, but a little bit of an impact as they roll forward, but it\u2019s just a reminder that even in China, where there\u2019s a much broader sense that COVID-19 is under control, it is not irrelevant yet. Until it becomes irrelevant, I suspect we will see a little bit of relative weakness in business transient and group, albeit they are dramatically stronger than what we\u2019re seeing in the United States, which of course would be the next strongest big market. You get to Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific, it\u2019s probably weaker yet.\nAnthony Powell: Understood, thanks. You\u2019ve mentioned a few times the relative strength of Homes and Villas over the summer, but it still seems that you do that as more of an amenity versus a core business. Is there an opportunity for you to maybe grow the inventory there and grow that business a bit more dramatically, given the demonstrated popularity of the offering that you\u2019ve seen?\nArne Sorenson: We are growing it. As we\u2019ve talked about from the beginning, though, our effort here is a whole home product and obviously if you look at our urban markets globally, but particularly in the United States, you would see that we\u2019ve got tremendous hotel capacity and extraordinarily little demand in those markets. Partly that\u2019s because offices remain closed in too many of those markets, you don\u2019t have business transient travel, you may not have much leisure travel because people are more inclined to go to resort destinations or other destinations.  We will remain focused, I think, on whole home, warm weather, ski country, resort destinations. I am quite convinced that that will continue to grow substantially and it will be a nice complementary feature to the traditional hotel business for us.\nAnthony Powell: Could you work with developers to maybe build new inventory in those markets, like ski resorts or warm weather, or is that mainly going to be finding existing inventory?\nArne Sorenson: It\u2019ll be both. We have had conversations with some of our good partners about exactly what you\u2019re talking about, which is building new inventory, if you will, in some of those resort markets. \nAnthony Powell: Great, thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Anthony, just one follow-up on your comment about business travel, is to remember that in the ballpark of a quarter of the travel in China in our hotels is from international business from outside China, so the fact that business nights, yes, they are down but again you\u2019re also having the impact that you\u2019re not getting the travelers from outside China coming in. So all things considered, I would--although it\u2019s not quite as robust as leisure because people are not traveling outside China, it\u2019s still quite robust a recovery on the business side. \nAnthony Powell: Thanks for that detail, appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz: Hi everyone, thanks for taking my questions.\nArne Sorenson: How are you, David?\nDavid Katz: Hey, good morning. Good to hear everyone\u2019s voices.  As you talk to your business peers, we obviously are all very focused on this business travel element. Do you think the collective wisdom is that--you know, the gating factor is entirely therapeutic, or is that one component of maybe a larger set of strategies to get the likes of me out and traveling again? What are you hearing? \nArne Sorenson: Well, I think there are three things, and obviously the most urgent and most impactful will be what happens with COVID-19. Clearly travel has plummeted because of the risks associated with it and the way those have impacted either through formal restrictions or informal restrictions - think about airline capacity, international travel, all of those sorts of things - that impact has been very profound. We will have, I think, a meaningful step up in group and business transient travel the moment that COVID-19 risk recedes from the threatening horizon, if you will.  I think once that happens, there are two other things that we\u2019re going to have to pay attention to. One is what\u2019s the state of the underlying economy, and as we\u2019ve all watched for years and years and years, demand in our industry does correlate well with the strength of the economy, and my guess is we\u2019re going to see an economy which has got some lingering weakness because of small businesses being closed, many probably not able to reopen, relatively higher levels of unemployment around the world, a number of factors that it will take some time for us to work our way through. Then I think the third is what happens as a function of remote work, the digital tools we\u2019ve all learned to use even more than we used before to meet with each other and stay connected in a time in which we can\u2019t be out, maybe can\u2019t even be in our offices let alone traveling, and there of course you\u2019ve got significant conversation about how much of that will impact long term travel trends.  That last piece, to some extent, is similar to the conversations we participated in during the Great Recession and even when the tech bubble burst in early 2001 and 9/11 followed, and the travel recession we had then. What generally we saw is that in the few years following, most of that group and most of that business transient travel comes back. Not all of it - if you look at 20 years\u2019 worth of mix for the industry and including for Marriott, we have seen a couple of points, maybe two or three points shift from business transient and group combined towards leisure. I suspect we\u2019ll continue to see that in the years ahead as leisure remains probably a pretty powerful driver of demand, but we\u2019ll get through--we\u2019ll see business transient move to--the fact of the matter is, people love to travel, they love to travel both for themselves personally and they love to travel for work. It\u2019s often the most interesting, and the places they\u2019re going to learn the most, and we\u2019ll see the lion\u2019s share of that come back, even if it\u2019s not every single night from every single company that we do business with. \nDavid Katz: Noted, and--\nArne Sorenson: Does that answer your question, David?\nDavid Katz: It largely does. If I can follow it up, just specifically around the COVID piece of your answer and the need for a vaccine to be a gating factor to mitigate the risks of COVID, are you hearing from any of your peers about interim steps or alternative strategies in conjunction with or instead of vaccine? Just trying to think about whether we\u2019re sitting around waiting for one single event or a series of things, just from what you\u2019re hearing.\nArne Sorenson: Yes, I think--I do spend a lot of time talking to our big customers, sometimes though the business roundtable, sometimes in other one-on-one contexts, and I\u2019d hesitate to speak for the corporate world globally but I do think there is an increasing sense that with each passing month, we lose a little bit more in terms of the connective tissue between our people in companies in all sorts of different industries. I think as a consequence--and you know, when you\u2019re talking about collaboration or innovation or strategic conversations, that maybe is most obvious that those are the things that are harder to do through a Teams call or through some sort of digital tool, so I think there is a sense that when we can safely do it, we should start to probably more significantly open offices and bring people back to work.  That is made difficult by a resurgence of the virus today - you know, I think we\u2019re talking about some days with over 100,000 new cases in the United States, and it\u2019s made difficult by the school situation, which some markets they\u2019re open, some markets they\u2019re closed, in many market they\u2019re hybrid, and employers are trying to work their way through that process. But I am hopeful that we will, even before the vaccine is broadly distributed, we will start to see offices opened up with social distancing, with mask wearing, and probably with reduced density, but starting to get to a place where it\u2019s at least a step towards a more normal environment. It has to be done safely, but I think it can be done safely because I don\u2019t think the office environment is a particularly risky one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s probably as risky as the grocery store, for that matter. We will start to see, I think, some positive impact on our business from that too, and that could precede the vaccine.\nDavid Katz: Right. If I can ask one more very short follow-up, you commented earlier in your remarks about conversions and accepting or embracing those that are financially accretive and brand accretive. If you could just color us, because all conversions are clearly not created equal beyond the financial impact, how you think about that brand accretive concept beyond just REVPAR index and the like?\nArne Sorenson: Yes, I\u2019m not sure you can even find out what we all do because we don\u2019t necessarily publish it. I think some of our--some players in the industry are compensating their folks simply for adding units. Our compensation tools basically are to reward folks for units that deliver value, so an NPV calculation is a big part of or compensation scheme for the folks on our team that out there, helping us grow.  We\u2019ve also got our brand and operators that are involved in making sure that the products we bring on meet brand standards, and typically that will come home to roost for conversion in what does that property improvement plan look like for a pre-existing hotel in order to put one of our flags on it, and we want to make sure that--obviously we want to make sure we\u2019re growing. We\u2019re really interested only in growing if it\u2019s delivering value. We\u2019re about creating value, we\u2019re not about simply adding rooms that have no value, but we know long term that the reinforcing aspect of the power of growth depends on the strength of the brands, and so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we are getting the kind of quality that represents the brand well. So all of those three things are going to be very much in the mix, and if we can\u2019t be satisfied that all three of those exist, we\u2019re not going to take that product.\nDavid Katz: Thanks very much. Be well, everyone.\nArne Sorenson: You too.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Hey, good morning. It was helpful in the prepared remarks that over 90% of hotels in China had positive gross operating profit in September. Do you have that percentage by region or for your broader portfolio, and how has it--I know you anticipate it to trend. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, I don\u2019t have it for you by region. Obviously it\u2019s not going to surprise you, we\u2019ve got big chunks of hotels still closed in CALA and Europe and with REVPAR down in the 70%, that\u2019s an extremely difficult process for them. In the U.S., I\u2019ll work in getting you some numbers, but obviously it\u2019s going to be a far lower percentage. But again, I think it shows you in China the remarkable resilience of both the profits and the revenues from a demand perspective.\nThomas Allen: I guess the bigger question in a way is the--I mean, on the surface, I think people view that this is going to be a relatively--I mean, in the short term, it\u2019s a very deep downturn, and then there\u2019s some concerns it\u2019s going to be a long recovery and hotels may be seeing negative operating profits for a prolonged period of time, which on the surface a lot of people feel like will lead to closures, maybe not now but maybe once debt maintenance deferrals are put off. What gives you confidence that that\u2019s not going to be the case?\nLeeny Oberg: A couple things. First, again I think you do have to look back at how-you do have to look at China as being somewhat helpful in evaluating how things can come back, so I don\u2019t think--although we haven\u2019t seen it everywhere else, I think it is instructive.  Then for example, when you\u2019ve seen in the luxury occupancy at the resorts, you\u2019ve clearly seen that the leisure demand has moved that up quite nicely when you see the Ritz Carlton brand, for example, had 27% occupancy in the third quarter in North America, and we\u2019ve talked before about how breakeven occupancy can be around 40%, and that\u2019s still with REVPAR for Ritz Carlton being down 64%, so all that to be said is I think it can rebound fairly quickly. I think if you look back and see what happened in the Great Recession, you also had the most complex hotels dramatically impacted by a massive drop in demand, and what you saw is while it took a little bit of time, they did get through it, they did get through to generally not being foreclosed upon, and getting back to strong profits and, in many cases, incentive fees for us. So while I appreciate--we all appreciate that this is going to take longer than any of us would like, I think the most--the guiding light, I know that we see, is how quickly when people feel comfortable about travel, how quickly demand returns and, frankly, rate. All things considered, rate has held up fairly well when you think about big picture, where things are. For example, when you see a quick pop to demand and a drive to luxury resort, you actually see that rate stays in pretty good shape, and again I think we\u2019ve worked on the cost structure at the hotels to be able to take up some of the slack that has been created from the demand side. You know, you\u2019re right about it will depend based on how long this takes, but generally speaking the hotels are in better shape from a leverage standpoint than they were the last go around. I do think the lenders have been quite patient and I think when we get some ability to travel, that the demand is going to come back fairly quickly.\nThomas Allen: Helpful color, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. You covered a lot of ground this morning, but I just wanted to ask you longer term, when free cash does start to re-accelerate more meaningfully, are there any changes in the way that you\u2019re thinking about the leverage levels that you\u2019d like to attain, or should we expect that you\u2019ll just really focus on reducing debt, or maybe how do you think about returning to a dividend program or some sort of repurchase program?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure, thanks Smedes. I would love to be thinking about those questions. I think for the moment, that\u2019s still a little ways off. This will obviously depend on how quick REVPAR come back, and we\u2019ve got--as you know, we\u2019ve got leverage ratios that we want to get back in line, certainly on our revolver covenant, to even consider share repurchase and dividends. We need to get back to four times to be able to even consider that, so I think it\u2019s a ways off in terms of actual planning. I think one of the things that you know we\u2019ve been focused on is really thinking about our debt maturity stack, and so that is one of the things that we\u2019ve done that is more permanent and I think will hold us in good stead as we think about managing our cash flow. When you\u2019re not looking at having quite as much in commercial paper, which is so short term and so much more subject to a crisis like this, obviously stretching out our maturities will be helpful, but I think we want to be strong investment grade, we want to continue to be in that range, but we also will obviously be working hard to generate that excess cash flow to consider what to do with it. We like a mix of dividends, of a modest dividend and share repurchase for the flexibility and for the modest ongoing return to the shareholders, and I suspect that we will continue to like that; but exactly where we want to peg the leverage, I think will absolutely depend on the pace of this recovery and the timing of it.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you. Appreciate that.\nArne Sorenson: Let me throw one thing in on this, if I can. What Leeny said is exactly right - there\u2019s obviously been a fair amount of conversation in policy circles about whether repurchasing stock is somehow a sign of bad behavior by corporate America or by businesses around the world. In the context of Marriott, we have been buying back stock for decades - 40 years, 45 years maybe, something like that, and it is not because we are uninterested in growing our business or investing in the economy or in our people but because the business produces cash and in the fullness of time, we often find that we do not have attractive enough investments to use all of the capacity. As a consequence, we believe it\u2019s our shareholders money and should be returned to shareholders, either through dividends or share repurchases. While Leeny\u2019s comments about let\u2019s take this one step at a time and see how the recovery and EBITDA comes back, and we\u2019ll continue to monitor this in terms of appropriate debt ratios and the like, and the maturity ladder of the debt that we have, all of those things are extremely important. I do think we will get back fairly quickly, in fact, towards a place where we have excess financial resources that belong to our shareholders and that through dividends and share repurchases, we will continue to give it back to them.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, good. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you too, just circling back on the SVC, assuming those rooms do come out of the system, I assume that that lifts a lot of territorial restrictions, and just given that it is a big chunk, and you sort of talked about this on your opening remarks, but what would be the strategy, I guess, to replace rooms in those markets sooner rather than later? I\u2019m not really familiar where the hotels specifically are, but would you expect to have a very focused conversation with developers or even conversion opportunities in those markets to replace your presence there faster, sooner rather than later?\nArne Sorenson: Our development team has already looked at that list and they are obviously going to be focused on the markets where they are convinced hotels will make good economic sense, and we\u2019ll be talking to the appropriate partners in those markets to see whether or not we can add something there quickly.  Now, they will be new builds, so obviously it--and we are in a pandemic, so it\u2019s not like they will be opening in the first quarter of 2021, but I suspect that we\u2019ll move fairly quickly.\nLeeny Oberg: And without getting too far into conversations, we\u2019ve already received some phone calls on that very topic from some of our partners, so I think you can expect there will be some near term opportunities.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Just sort of on that, are developers--do you have just a sense in general of how a developer is able to access financing now, or what sort of changes are you seeing?\nLeeny Oberg: I think obviously you\u2019ve got the reality that our large multi-unit partners and our lenders are assessing the situation and trying to figure out the health of their own assets, whether it\u2019s the loans or the hotels they own. That is in some cases requiring that they take a bit of a pause, but at the same time these are in many cases folks who are thinking over the longer term and who do have access to capital to get things going, so again as you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve clearly had a drop in signings, we\u2019ve had lenders clearly waiting on the sidelines, but it\u2019s not to say that all activity has stopped.  Certainly in some of our larger diversified owners, they\u2019ve got the ability to continue to move forward, looking at pieces of land and starting the process in talking to us and putting deals together, so the conversations certainly get going. I think as you\u2019ve seen, certainly on the financing front, kind of putting pen to paper and getting committed capital on some deal has slowed, but the conversations absolutely continue. You know, the business has had downturns before, it\u2019s a cyclical business, and will again, so I think this I sometimes when there can be some great opportunity, but to really see things pick up in a meaningful way will take that there\u2019s more resolution around the COVID situation. \nSmedes Rose: Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein. \nRichard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the reimbursed costs. It looks like you were profitable on that line in Q3, but you\u2019re talking about making a 25% cost saving in there. What will actually happen to the costs you save in there? Does that benefit the owners? Are you going to be able to cut their fees or will you reinvest that in marketing, or does Marriott benefit somehow from that?\nLeeny Oberg: Right, well we benefit from it indirectly. We benefit from the standpoint that obviously we need to make sure that what we charge for our programs and services is competitive in a variety of REVPAR scenarios, and as you know, many, many of our charges are actually based on hotel level revenues, so they\u2019re a percent of sales, so we\u2019ve got to make sure that our costs also flex with those changes.  First and foremost, ultimately on the reimbursements, it is a net neutral goal. What you\u2019re trying to do over time is to match your costs to your revenues, but also make sure that what you\u2019re charging the properties is competitive. So you\u2019re right that you see it\u2019s positive, but again that\u2019s overwhelmingly due to loyalty, and I talked before earlier, that really does flex a bit depending on what\u2019s going on with redemption buy-in. We do basically manage it over time to be neutral, as well as all the other programs and services that we charge the hotels for.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, so just to clarify, in future years the costs you\u2019ll need to spend there will go down by 25%, but you should be able to recover the revenues you make in that line--\nLeeny Oberg: I was going to say, since so many of the charges that we\u2019re charging them flex with revenues, I\u2019ve got to reduce my costs by that 25%, because remember I can\u2019t charge them as much. So when we talk about many of those costs that are above property related to programs and services, that is a function of knowing that as you think about, for example, next year, we\u2019re likely to enter into the year not meaningfully different from where we are now, unless there\u2019s some unbelievable piece of news. So again, we\u2019re just making sure that our cost structure matches what we by contract are able to charge the owners, so that 25% savings is really designed to match what we\u2019re charging the owners, but also to try to find ways, as I said in my comments, to actually reduce the rate that we\u2019re charging for programs and services, which will then show up in higher hotel profits over time, which should make us more competitive as a manager and franchisor. Does that address your question?\nRichard Clarke: That makes sense. If I can also ask one very quick clarification - on the front of your release today, you talk about a number of hotels that you\u2019ve opened from other brands. Does that include from independents as well or is it just from alternative brands operators?\nArne Sorenson: It\u2019s from independents as well.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, it\u2019s from any - independent or other brand.\nRichard Clarke: Makes sense, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: At this time, we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Sorenson for closing remarks.\nArne Sorenson: All right, well thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. I was thinking as the questions were asked by so many of you, how much we miss you. It\u2019s great to hear your voices.\nLeeny Oberg: So true!\nArne Sorenson: We hope you\u2019re all navigating through this time well. We obviously can\u2019t wait, for so many reasons, to see you in person again soon, and between now and then, we wish you nothing but the best.  Obviously if there are questions that we didn\u2019t get to this morning, feel free to call the team and we\u2019ll be in touch and make sure you\u2019ve got the information you need to have. But thank you all, be well.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2020 conference call. Joining me today are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President, Investor Relations. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements made in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actually events unfold.  Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our REVPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency year-over-year changes for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Before I talk about the quarter, I want to again thank our incredible team of associates around the world who continue to work tirelessly and show true resilience during these challenging times. The power of the Marriott culture has never been more evident and I am incredibly grateful. I hope everyone joining us today is staying safe and well. While COVID-19 is still significantly impacting our business, our third quarter results showed meaningful improvement versus the second quarter. Third quarter worldwide REVPAR declined 66%, almost 19 percentage points better than last quarter's decline. Globally 94% of our hotels are now open with 97% open in North America. Our worldwide occupancy levels improved each month during the quarter and continued to close the gap to last years. We saw a steady climb in demand through August and then the rate of improvement began to plateau towards the end of the quarter in most regions; however, we are pleased with the overall progress we have made since the trough in April.  In September, our global occupancy reached just over 37%, an improvement of 25 percentage points from April's 12%. Worldwide REVPAR in September declined 64% versus September of last year, over 25 percentage points better than the year-over-year decline in April. The recovery trajectories have differed greatly by region. The recovery in Greater China, especially in mainland China, has been the strongest. Results have improved meaningfully since February, demonstrating the resiliency of travel when the virus is perceived to be firmly under control. Occupancy in mainland China reached 67% in September, a bit ahead of occupancy in September of last year and an extraordinary improvement from 9% occupancy in February.  In 2019, around 75% of room nights in mainland China were sourced from domestic guests. Even with strict travel entry requirements limiting visitors from outside the mainland, demand has rebounded strongly across all segments. Leisure transient bookings in the third quarter were over 25% ahead of last year's bookings, helped by domestic travelers taking more trips inside the country. Business transient and group bookings have strengthened each month since February solely from domestic meetings and events but are still lagging a bit compared to last year. Hong Kong and Macau, which are reliance on visitors from the mainland, are recovering more slowly as travel restrictions are easing, but cumbersome entry procedures are still inhibiting demand.  Demand in the rest of Asia Pacific has also continued to improve but generally at a much slower pace. Countries are in various stages of reopening with many still imposing strict travel restrictions. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and the Philippines continue to drive performance, helped by quarantine business for travelers entering those countries. In North America, where 95% of room nights in 2019 were sourced from domestic travelers, results in the third quarter were also meaningfully better than the second quarter, though the rate of improvement did slow in September. Third quarter REVPAR declined 65% versus the third quarter of last year with occupancy reaching 37%.  During the quarter, all chain scales continued to show improvement versus the second quarter, although there were still large variations among hotels and markets. Drive-to leisure demand continued to lead the recovery, particularly for extended stay and resort hotels and for properties in secondary and tertiary markets. Business transient and group bookings in the quarter picked up modestly versus the second quarter but still remain significantly lower versus last year. The improvement in demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA, has also been slower than in North America and China. In the last few weeks, rising numbers of cases in many countries in Europe and CALA have led governments to re-impose or extend lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing regulations. These measures discourage international travelers, who made up about 40% of Europe's room nights and about 60% of CALA's room nights in 2019.  Compared to CALA and Europe, demand trends have been a bit better in the Middle East and Africa, where international guests have historically made up around 50% of room nights. Certain resort properties in Turkey, the UAE and Qatar were particularly strong in the quarter. Currently 20% of hotels are closed in CALA, 26% of hotels are closed in Europe, and 9% are closed in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, the plateauing of demand that we saw towards the end of the third quarter has generally continued into the first few weeks of the fourth quarter. Occupancy levels in most regions have remained relatively in line to slightly better versus September levels, which were marginally ahead of occupancy levels in August.  Booking windows remain very short and visibility is still limited; nonetheless, we do expect an easier year-over-year REVPAR comparison in the fourth quarter given our historical seasonality. We usually see a substantial step down in occupancy around the world in November and December as compared to September and October due to the holidays and relatively less business travel.  In 2019, global occupancy was around five percentage points lower in November than October, and then December occupancy was another eight percentage points lower than November. This year with the leisure segment showing the strongest demand, we could see occupancy levels throughout the fourth quarter remain relatively flat with September and October. As a result, year-over-year REVPAR comparisons could look better in the fourth quarter than they did in the third. Of course, as we have seen to date, results vary greatly by region and can change quickly, and the recent virus resurgences in numerous countries could have a dampening effect on demand. We know the road to recovery is going to take some time; however, we have been very pleased with the progress we are making across a number of key operational and financial areas. One of the biggest operational adjustments has been our heightened cleanliness standards. The health and safety of our associates and guests remains a top priority. Throughout the pandemic, we have adjusted our protocols to elevate our cleanliness guidelines and tools, and every property across our portfolio is now required to complete a monthly commitment to clean certification. By increasingly leveraging contactless technologies such a mobile and web check-in, mobile key and mobile chat, we are re-imagining the guest stay experience while also amplifying operational efficiencies. We also continue to roll out innovative targeted phased in marketing strategies. Our messaging emphasizes our heightened cleaning guidelines and safety measures while appealing to evolving consumer sentiment and travel intent. Many of our recent creative offerings, such as Fall for Travel and our October Week of Wonders, have been very successful in sparking leisure demand, and at the end of October we announced our new Work from Anywhere packages, which are designed to capture additional revenue driven by the remote work trend. Our award-wining loyalty program underpins all of our marketing strategies and we remain focused on engaging with our 145 million Marriott Bonvoy members, including those who are not yet ready for a hotel stay. We have also been highlighting non-hotel stay experiences such as Eat Around Town and Homes and Villas by Marriott International, and in collaboration with American Express and Chase we have been offering numerous grocery and retail spending accelerators and limited time offers on our co-branded credit cards. The increased demand amongst our Bonvoy members for our homes and villas whole home rentals during the pandemic and a much more modest decline in Chase and Amex Bonvoy card spend compared to the decline in REVPAR are great indicators of the value of the Bonvoy program to our customers. Another key constituency is our owner and franchisee community. We have had an unprecedented level of engagement with them this year, including weekly webinars in many regions and more frequent interactions with our owner advisory committees. We are deeply committed to working closely together to manage through these challenging times. We remain focused on reducing their costs as much as possible in this environment, as Leeny will discuss during her remarks. On the development front, we now anticipate net rooms growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2020, the high end of our expectation from a quarter ago, reflecting strong openings in the third quarter. This takes into account 1.5% to 2% deletions which is around 50 basis points higher than we estimated in February, primarily due to certain hotels that were already struggling entering 2020 deciding to close permanently due to COVID-19. Given the current fluid environment, we have more uncertainty than usual on opening dates for many hotels nearing completion, but the good news is that 46% of our almost 500,000 room pipeline is currently under construction with rooms under construction up 6.5% from a year ago. Although signings are not as strong as in 2019, they are quite solid considering the extraordinary impact of COVID-19 on our industry. We believe that many of the rooms that do not open in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 will now likely open in 2021. The pace of openings will likely vary depending on the recovery of lodging demand in specific markets, with heightened uncertainty in markets where air lift is key. We are also encouraged by the increasing number of conversations we are having around conversions. We remain keenly focused on conversion opportunities that are accretive from both a brand and a financial value perspective. Assuming progress is made in containing the virus, we would expect our gross room additions to accelerate next year compared to our expectations for 2020. We are in the middle of developing our 2021 budget so it is too soon to give a definitive outlook for room deletions for the coming year. It is worth noting that the potential 2021 exit of the 89 hotels owned by Service Properties Trust, which are almost all limited service properties, would create a short term headwind of roughly 1% in net rooms growth, but we are confident in our ability to replace many of those first generation limited service hotels with brand-new updated product. Finally, as Leeny will discuss in a moment, we have made significant strides in shoring up our financial position to weather the crisis. While the recovery is going to take longer than anyone would like, we are seeing encouraging signs that demand can be extremely resilient. With the steps we have taken for our customers and owners, the power of Marriott Bonvoy, our strength and liquidity position, and our incredible team of associates around the world, I am confident that we are very well positioned now and for the future. Now I'll turn the call over to Leeny Oberg, our CFO. Hey Shaun. All right, well there's a lot in that, and let me start maybe by saying it's still a little early, obviously. There is a lot of uncertainty out there because of the pandemic. I think we were pleased to see in Q3 the increase in openings again compared to Q2. I think Q2, to some extent, even as projects were ready to reopen, either restrictions precluded it or the total lack of business precluded it, or just the uncertainty in the environment precluded to it. So to get to about 19,000 rooms opening in Q3, I think is a sign that at least for projects that are under construction and nearing completion, those will open, and I think that's what gives us the most optimism about not just Q4 but looking into 2021, that we should see - obviously all of this depends on the virus, but that we should see these projects that are under construction open as scheduled, if you will, over the course of the next couple of years, something like that, but very much including 2021. The deletion side of the equation is harder, and of course there's an offsetting potential upside, which is conversions. Both depend a little bit on what happens with properties are under trouble and what happens with change in ownership or change in capital structure for existing hotels. Some of what we've lost year to date, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, are hotels that entered the COVID-19 pandemic already under financial pressure and simply did not make sense to reopen, certainly not to reopen under their current positioning. I suspect we'll see some that next year. Besides SVC, we don't have a number for it yet - we're obviously just in the process of trying to build our budget. Our teams are dealing with owners all around the world. I think by and large on the positive side, conversions into our system and on the negative side deletions from our system will become clearer as ownership of hotels change hands or as the new capital stacks are put in place, and I suspect that will begin to occur more in 2021 than it is doing right now. Yes, SVC is very unusual. Those portfolios were initially put in place with HPT 20 years ago, maybe 25 years ago, something like that, and they were initially a lease structure or a lease-like structure. They've evolved since to be sort of a management structure but with a cap guarantee. That structure was re-done with SVC earlier this year. We were quite optimistic that actually it was done in a way that would bode well for long term, including getting substantial additional new capital into those assets to bring them up to standard, and of course the pandemic had profound impact to that. We are in discussions with SVC today about the possibility of renewing that. I think based on what we heard, including as recently as yesterday from that team, they seem to be hard wired to make those hotels Sonestas. We of course don't know exactly how Sonesta would perform, but looking at the ROI from assets that are Sonesta flag versus ours, it looks like that ROI is roughly half, and it's a little bit surprising to us that the separate stockholder and debt holder interest in SVC could be furthered by converting those to Sonesta's brand, as opposed to the dramatically stronger brands that are on those hotels today.  But again, that seems to be the direction they're heading, and so our expectations would be that those hotels would leave the system. We do not think there is anything comparable to that, that remains in the system. You bet. Yes, it's a fair question. I think generally we would say that everything in that pipeline has gotten extended by at least a few months. Undoubtedly that's a little bit of an overstatement, but when we deal with--think about the end of the first quarter and the second quarter of this year, with business sort of functionally disappearing in many markets around the world, including restrictions on lots of activity that is happening in those markets, the uncertainty and those restrictions certainly caused many, many, many projects to slow down, even if they were already under construction, so I think it's a fair point to say that if in January of 2020, we targeted a June of 2021 opening, that opening could well have slipped by a few months. We do have a team that is out there working with our development partners and trying to make sure they understand what is under construction and what the status of that construction and what the forecasted opening is, for obvious reasons. I think on the very positive side here, the 45% or so of the rooms that are in the pipeline that are under construction, 230,000 rooms roughly, we can all have an extraordinarily high level of confidence that those hotels are going to open. I think you get beyond that to the hotels that are not under construction yet and I think we're going to have to watch that. I think they are real projects, in many respects the land is owned and controlled, they've been designed, they've been improved by us and by our partners. We have signed contracts for the overwhelming majority of them, but if construction hasn't started, each one of those partners has got to make a decision about what do I get for building in a weaker environment, which I might save something on construction costs, and what do I potentially lose in committing myself to a project that may open in a market that is harder for me to predict and underwrite today. Our experience from prior crises is that most of the projects which are not under construction overwhelmingly will ultimately open, but the delay in those openings could be not just some quarters, but some years, particularly for the higher end luxury or full service projects that may take some time to get financed and get underway.  So on balance, I think we would say we can have a reasonably high level of confidence that the gross openings will step up next year - again, this is based on reasonable assumptions on what happens with COVID-19, but it's a little bit too soon for us to give you really precise numbers about it. Good question, Robin, and good morning. I think what we want to do is have as many of the savings as we've been able to find and implement be long lasting, to state the obvious. I think there are some, and your question illustrates a few of them. I mean, food and beverage service, I think would be one that's on the top of my list, maybe even before a doorman. We have, particularly in the markets in which demand is the weakest, we have fairly limited, sometimes dramatically limited food and beverage service, and that's not going to be satisfactory to most guests when we get back to a normal demand environment. Guests can be quite sympathetic and empathetic during a tough, tough time, but when we get back to something that feels a little bit more normal, they're going to expect the full services, particularly from a full service hotel that they have come to anticipate.  Having said that, I think we will see some things in keyless entry, I think we will see some things in the staffing models that we have been experimenting with. I think some of the above property costs that have been cut, and Leeny can talk a little bit about that, we think will stick and stay for a while. I mean, our estimates today, I think are--we've probably reduced breakeven occupancy by three to five points, something like that, depending on the brand.  At the end of the day, though, we've got to make sure that the guest is satisfied with the experience that they're getting, and you're right - it's going to vary a little bit from brand to brand and segment to segment. Obviously the advantages, of course, on the higher end segment is we'll see rate begin to move at some point up too, even as the costs move forward a little bit.  Net-net, we'd expect that what we've done should deliver some long lasting margin improvement. It's a little too soon to be able to tell you what that number will be. Yes, I don't have that number. I know that the team is talking, having significantly more conversations around conversions than they've had in the past. The one quarter signings don't necessarily make a huge amount of difference - I'm aware of a few significant ones that are underway now and the team of transactors that are working on them are hoping that they get done in the fourth quarter. Whether that happens or not, of course, is another question. We've gone back and looked at our conversions experience through the cycles - obviously we knew this is of interest not just to you but to us as well, and you can see even in the last two years before COVID, we had--of our openings in 2019, 18% were conversions, but the year before in 2018, it was 12%, and so you can see a little bit the obvious fact here, which is even in a very similar economic environment, these things can be a little bit lumpy and a little bit hard to predict. We're in the teens for most of the last decade or so, and conversions as a percentage of our openings were highest coming out of the Great Recession - '11 was higher than '10, '12 was higher than '11, '13 was higher than '12, and as a percentage they peaked in '13 but the number of rooms we opened as conversions in 2014 was higher yet again.  Again, this is what we said before, but we would expect conversion activity to increase certainly in terms of discussions starting now. We would expect that the more substantial increase in terms of actually opening into our system will depend a bit on the new ownership structures or financial structures for hotels that caused those folks to be able to look to the future and say, I now know what I want to do with that hotel. Our group business for next year is down about 30%. It won't surprise you to know that the first quarter is the worst by far in terms of group business on the books, and as you get farther into the year, the decline is meaningfully less than that 30% number. What does that tell you? It tells you that folks are still optimistic about holding their meetings, that COVID-19 will allow them to hold their meetings as you get further into 2021. I think we are optimistic, as are many, that we can have a vaccine or two, maybe, approved by the end of this calendar year, and could see it start to get broadly distributed by sometime in the first half, maybe it's the latter part of the first half, but sometime in the first half of 2021. As that takes hold, we're optimistic that group business will come back. I think what we're seeing in group today, and I think you've heard this from other companies in the industry, there is group business. Obviously it's stronger in China, but coming back to the United States for a second, the group business in hotels in the United States is not a lot like the group that I think we all first think of, which is corporate group and association business and the like. I think the group business we have today is much more likely to be healthcare workers or somehow connected with the COVID-19 pandemic itself, or things that are more leisure focused - that could be some athletic groups, it could be some larger family groups, that sort of thing. The core corporate business is still pretty weak. I don't think you should read too much into the efforts we've made to manage our costs in the sales space. Obviously those costs are borne by the system of hotels that are out there. We have got to make sure that we're managing those costs in a way that meets the level of reimbursement that can come in there, and we're doing our best to do that and to make sure we continue to call on the customers that we know are important to us and important to the recovery. We'd be optimistic, I think, if COVID-19 goes the way we think, that we will start to see this group business that's on the books hang tight and ultimately come to pass, and we'll start to see meaningfully more bookings when those vaccines start to take effect. Conversions and development - you're talking about hotel development, or back to credit cards and the Bonvoy program? Yes, well I think we mentioned a bit of this in the prepared remarks, that we've been actually quite pleased with the performance of the credit card portfolio during this crisis. It's probably worth starting with that because you would wonder about how well that would do, an Affinity card for travel in a market in which there is very little travel. But what we've seen is that folks are still aspiring to travel, dreaming about travel, eager to get back on the road, and as a consequence when we've with our credit card partners done things around grocery or done things around restaurants or around hardware, the card has performed extraordinarily well. The Bonvoy membership, I think, has continued to engage with us in a way that's pretty powerful.  I think if you go back to before the pandemic, what we saw was a continued increase year-over-year on the number of Bonvoy members as a percentage of the total business in our hotels, and one of the frustrating things, we talked about this a quarter ago, about the timing of this pandemic is as we got into the second half of 2019 particularly, the Starwood integration work was behind us, the systems work was behind us, the new Bonvoy program was launched and we could see, whether it was in REVPAR index or in loyalty penetration or other data we look at very carefully, really powerful momentum towards proving the value of those programs. I don't have any doubt that we will get back to that. It will come back stronger, obviously, the sooner people get back on the road and know that travel is going to be a part of the way they live their lives, but when they do, they will find that they've got a credit card program, they'll find that they've got a broad portfolio of destinations to stay at - we have the biggest portfolio of hotels around the world, clearly the strongest in the luxury and lifestyle and resort and urban space, plus other things like Eating Around Town and Homes and Villas and other things that we still are working on and hope to get launched before too long. Leeny, you want to take that? No, I don't think so. Obviously we talked about occupancy being higher than it was a year ago, and so that's a really good sign; but beneath that total, you've got two things that are happening. One is that business transient travel and group travel is still a bit softer than it was last year, and the second is you've got the Chinese travel business that used to go abroad staying home, which is driving those leisure numbers meaningfully higher. Remember we had in February 9% occupancy in China, a country entirely shut down, and even today now we have occasionally a flare-up in a market in which the Chinese government response is to essentially shut down that market and test everybody in the market for COVID-19, and they've managed at least in two or three circumstances to nip that in the bud, if you will, and get those markets reopened and get going again.  They have had an impact to us, probably less than a point or so on REVPAR, but a little bit of an impact as they roll forward, but it's just a reminder that even in China, where there's a much broader sense that COVID-19 is under control, it is not irrelevant yet. Until it becomes irrelevant, I suspect we will see a little bit of relative weakness in business transient and group, albeit they are dramatically stronger than what we're seeing in the United States, which of course would be the next strongest big market. You get to Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific, it's probably weaker yet. We are growing it. As we've talked about from the beginning, though, our effort here is a whole home product and obviously if you look at our urban markets globally, but particularly in the United States, you would see that we've got tremendous hotel capacity and extraordinarily little demand in those markets. Partly that's because offices remain closed in too many of those markets, you don't have business transient travel, you may not have much leisure travel because people are more inclined to go to resort destinations or other destinations.  We will remain focused, I think, on whole home, warm weather, ski country, resort destinations. I am quite convinced that that will continue to grow substantially and it will be a nice complementary feature to the traditional hotel business for us. It'll be both. We have had conversations with some of our good partners about exactly what you're talking about, which is building new inventory, if you will, in some of those resort markets. How are you, David? Well, I think there are three things, and obviously the most urgent and most impactful will be what happens with COVID-19. Clearly travel has plummeted because of the risks associated with it and the way those have impacted either through formal restrictions or informal restrictions - think about airline capacity, international travel, all of those sorts of things - that impact has been very profound. We will have, I think, a meaningful step up in group and business transient travel the moment that COVID-19 risk recedes from the threatening horizon, if you will.  I think once that happens, there are two other things that we're going to have to pay attention to. One is what's the state of the underlying economy, and as we've all watched for years and years and years, demand in our industry does correlate well with the strength of the economy, and my guess is we're going to see an economy which has got some lingering weakness because of small businesses being closed, many probably not able to reopen, relatively higher levels of unemployment around the world, a number of factors that it will take some time for us to work our way through. Then I think the third is what happens as a function of remote work, the digital tools we've all learned to use even more than we used before to meet with each other and stay connected in a time in which we can't be out, maybe can't even be in our offices let alone traveling, and there of course you've got significant conversation about how much of that will impact long term travel trends.  That last piece, to some extent, is similar to the conversations we participated in during the Great Recession and even when the tech bubble burst in early 2001 and 9/11 followed, and the travel recession we had then. What generally we saw is that in the few years following, most of that group and most of that business transient travel comes back. Not all of it - if you look at 20 years' worth of mix for the industry and including for Marriott, we have seen a couple of points, maybe two or three points shift from business transient and group combined towards leisure. I suspect we'll continue to see that in the years ahead as leisure remains probably a pretty powerful driver of demand, but we'll get through--we'll see business transient move to--the fact of the matter is, people love to travel, they love to travel both for themselves personally and they love to travel for work. It's often the most interesting, and the places they're going to learn the most, and we'll see the lion's share of that come back, even if it's not every single night from every single company that we do business with. Does that answer your question, David? Yes, I think--I do spend a lot of time talking to our big customers, sometimes though the business roundtable, sometimes in other one-on-one contexts, and I'd hesitate to speak for the corporate world globally but I do think there is an increasing sense that with each passing month, we lose a little bit more in terms of the connective tissue between our people in companies in all sorts of different industries. I think as a consequence--and you know, when you're talking about collaboration or innovation or strategic conversations, that maybe is most obvious that those are the things that are harder to do through a Teams call or through some sort of digital tool, so I think there is a sense that when we can safely do it, we should start to probably more significantly open offices and bring people back to work.  That is made difficult by a resurgence of the virus today - you know, I think we're talking about some days with over 100,000 new cases in the United States, and it's made difficult by the school situation, which some markets they're open, some markets they're closed, in many market they're hybrid, and employers are trying to work their way through that process. But I am hopeful that we will, even before the vaccine is broadly distributed, we will start to see offices opened up with social distancing, with mask wearing, and probably with reduced density, but starting to get to a place where it's at least a step towards a more normal environment. It has to be done safely, but I think it can be done safely because I don't think the office environment is a particularly risky one. I don't think it's probably as risky as the grocery store, for that matter. We will start to see, I think, some positive impact on our business from that too, and that could precede the vaccine. Yes, I'm not sure you can even find out what we all do because we don't necessarily publish it. I think some of our--some players in the industry are compensating their folks simply for adding units. Our compensation tools basically are to reward folks for units that deliver value, so an NPV calculation is a big part of or compensation scheme for the folks on our team that out there, helping us grow.  We've also got our brand and operators that are involved in making sure that the products we bring on meet brand standards, and typically that will come home to roost for conversion in what does that property improvement plan look like for a pre-existing hotel in order to put one of our flags on it, and we want to make sure that--obviously we want to make sure we're growing. We're really interested only in growing if it's delivering value. We're about creating value, we're not about simply adding rooms that have no value, but we know long term that the reinforcing aspect of the power of growth depends on the strength of the brands, and so we've got to make sure that we are getting the kind of quality that represents the brand well. So all of those three things are going to be very much in the mix, and if we can't be satisfied that all three of those exist, we're not going to take that product. You too. Let me throw one thing in on this, if I can. What Leeny said is exactly right - there's obviously been a fair amount of conversation in policy circles about whether repurchasing stock is somehow a sign of bad behavior by corporate America or by businesses around the world. In the context of Marriott, we have been buying back stock for decades - 40 years, 45 years maybe, something like that, and it is not because we are uninterested in growing our business or investing in the economy or in our people but because the business produces cash and in the fullness of time, we often find that we do not have attractive enough investments to use all of the capacity. As a consequence, we believe it's our shareholders money and should be returned to shareholders, either through dividends or share repurchases. While Leeny's comments about let's take this one step at a time and see how the recovery and EBITDA comes back, and we'll continue to monitor this in terms of appropriate debt ratios and the like, and the maturity ladder of the debt that we have, all of those things are extremely important. I do think we will get back fairly quickly, in fact, towards a place where we have excess financial resources that belong to our shareholders and that through dividends and share repurchases, we will continue to give it back to them. Our development team has already looked at that list and they are obviously going to be focused on the markets where they are convinced hotels will make good economic sense, and we'll be talking to the appropriate partners in those markets to see whether or not we can add something there quickly.  Now, they will be new builds, so obviously it--and we are in a pandemic, so it's not like they will be opening in the first quarter of 2021, but I suspect that we'll move fairly quickly. It's from independents as well. All right, well thank you all very much for your time and attention this morning. I was thinking as the questions were asked by so many of you, how much we miss you. It's great to hear your voices. We hope you're all navigating through this time well. We obviously can't wait, for so many reasons, to see you in person again soon, and between now and then, we wish you nothing but the best.  Obviously if there are questions that we didn't get to this morning, feel free to call the team and we'll be in touch and make sure you've got the information you need to have. But thank you all, be well."

            "content": "Thanks Arne very much. I hope all of you on the call are staying safe and well. I'd also like to thank our team of associates for their incredible work this year in making sure Marriott comes through this crisis strong and healthy.  In the third quarter with global REVPAR down 66%, our gross fee revenues totaled $397 million, a decline of 58% versus the year ago quarter. Gross fees were comprised of base management fees of $87 million, franchise fees of $279 million, and incentive management fees, or IMFs, of $31 million. Seventy-five percent of IMFs in the quarter were earned at hotels in the Asia Pacific region where contracts generally have no owners priority.  Over 90% of our hotels in Greater China had positive gross operating profit in September with almost three quarters generating positive profit for the first nine months of the year. These results are a reflection of the strong rebound in demand and our ability to help our owners control costs. With franchise fee, our non-REVPAR related franchise fees were again much more resilient, totaling $119 million in the third quarter, down 18% from the year ago quarter with credit card fees down 22%.  Third quarter G&A improved by 40% year-over-year, primarily reflecting a full quarter of the difficult but necessary steps we took earlier this year in response to COVID-19. These steps included furloughs, reduced work weeks, and meaningful cuts in executive compensation. As REVPAR has improved from the global trough experienced in April, corporate and above property furloughs and reduced work weeks generally ended by late September. Of course, REVPAR is still well below 2019 levels and expected to take some time to fully recover. With that in mind, we focused on restructuring our organization to reduce costs on a more sustainable basis at the corporate and above property level, as well as at the hotel level so we can operate more efficiently today and going forward.  Our restructuring efforts are anticipated to reduce total corporate and other above property controllable costs by 25%, in line with the expectation we noted last quarter. This includes both classic corporate G&A as well as programs and services we provide to the hotels, for which we are reimbursed. We are still working through our budget and exact allocations for 2021, but based on our preliminary estimates we expect total corporate G&A costs in 2021 could be around 20% lower than our original 2020 guidance of $950 million to $960 million, with expenses for reimbursable programs and services down well over 25%. Importantly, we expect the reduction in G&A to be largely sustainable subject to wage and inflationary increases.  We reported third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $327 million, down 64% versus the third quarter of last year and a significant improvement from adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year. We do have a couple headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to third quarter adjusted EBITDA. As we have mentioned, G&A savings will not be as large as in the third quarter with the return of our workforce to full time, and the fourth quarter is a seasonally slower quarter.  At the hotel level, as part of our cost mitigation efforts we conducted a thorough review of all reimbursable programs and services in order to reduce the associated costs to our hotels. This work went beyond the naturally lower fees charged in this environment given that the majority of bill is based on a percent of hotel revenues. Our work has led to significantly lower expenses for the hotels. While some savings are volume related given fewer associates, transactions and the like, others reflect a real reduction in program rates. For example, after providing a discount this year on certain fixed mandatory fees paid by all of our hotels around the world, we have worked to provide a meaningful discount on these same fees in 2021 as well. Of course, we have also significantly cut our expenses associated with providing programs and services given the lower expected levels of reimbursements from the hotels. As we noted last quarter, we've been able to reduce breakeven profitability rates at our managed properties by three to five percentage points of occupancy. As you might imagine, we are applying this same disciplined approach to our owned and leased properties as well. We have also been allowing owners to access FF&E reserves for working capital and have extended the waiver of required funding of these FF&E funds through the end of March 2021, with lender consent where applicable. Additionally, we worked with our U.S. managed hotels to file for CARES Act tax credits which led to refunds of $119 million, which should help support our hotels' working capital position.  These measures combined with our aggressive collection efforts have been quite effective. The vast majority of our owners and franchisees continues to pay their bills on time or are on short term payment plans. Despite the current environment, only a small number of hotels have gone into foreclosure this year as lender have been relatively patient to date, and with only a handful of exceptions, the few hotels that are in foreclosure or receivership are retaining our flag. In North America, our management and related agreements generally protect us and historically we have held onto most franchise agreements as well when properties go into foreclosure. Last quarter, we laid out a cash burn scenario with REVPAR down 70% that indicated a monthly cash burn rate of around $85 million, or $255 million a quarter at that REVPAR decline. Our actual cash burn for the third quarter was around flat, much better than the model would have shown even including severance payments of around $60 million in the quarter that were not included in the model. We were pleased that total fees came in higher than our $2 million to $2.5 million of monthly fees per REVPAR point sensitivity would have predicted, with REVPAR for the quarter down 66% primarily due to higher incentive management fees. The other major drivers of our neutral cash burn were better owned lease results, lower G&A costs, strong working capital management, and robust loyalty program cash flows. The model we provided last quarter should still be useful as we think about potential monthly cash burn in the fourth quarter, with a couple updates. We still expect the sensitivity of a one-point change in REVPAR on our fees would be in the $2 million to $2.5 million per month range. As we've seen, the sensitivity is not completely linear given the variability of IMFs and does not include impact of changes in credit card fees. We expect that continued strong collections of receivables should again help minimize our working capital outlays in the fourth quarter.  Investment spending for the full year is now expected to be slightly below the low end of our prior expectation of $400 million to $450 million and significantly below our original forecast of $700 million to $800 million at the beginning of the year. This is another example of the strong progress we have made in reducing cash outlays in the current environment. The variance versus last quarter's expectation is primarily due to the timing of key money payments and additional reductions in systems spending.  There are also two timing-related items to highlight which will impact our cash flow in the fourth quarter. In October, our working capital was impacted by the funding of our 2019 company match to associates' 401k plan contributions, which totaled around $130 million. That payment usually occurs earlier in the year. Also, cash interest payments will be roughly $100 million higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter due to the timing of when the payments are due. Through the first three quarters of 2020 with year-over-year REVPAR down an unprecedented 59% through September 30, we have demonstrated our ability to adapt quickly and we've confirmed the power of our asset-light business model. Our cash from operations less capital expenditures has been positive year to date. At the end of the third quarter, our net liquidity was approximately $5.1 billion, representing roughly $1.5 billion in available cash balances plus $3.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. The substantial increase in liquidity from the prior quarter reflects our August $1 billion bond issuance maturing in 2032. Most of those proceeds were used to pay down a portion of our revolver balance. We believe our liquidity position and resilient cash flow from operations comfortably positions us to meet our short and long term obligations. In closing, while the timing of a full recovery is unpredictable, we're confident that COVID-19 will eventually be contained and that travel will come back quickly. We look forward to welcoming new and returning guests to our hotels before too long. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now open the lines for questions. It's also just worth noting one addition, that when you think about the impact on fees, it's quite minimal related to that portfolio. I think total fees in 2020 this year are expected to be $10 million to $15 million from those hotels. Hey Joe. Well, one of the big questions is around loyalty. If you remember, Joe, last year we actually had loyalty as a use of cash relative to strong redemptions throughout the system, and this year it's kind of a bit of the opposite. Now, the reality is I actually would expect next year that that stabilizes a bit as we continue to rebound from the low levels of demand that we are, so that while I would expect meaningfully more redemptions, they won't be quite at the same peak prices that they were in 2019. From that perspective, I would expect that loyalty is not as large a source of cash as this year, but also not like 2019 either. When I think about it overall, we're still early days as we go through the budgeting process, but I would not see it as a major source but also not a major use of cash next year, as we think about from a working capital perspective. The only other thing I'd add, Steven, is the digital experience. If you think about travelers today, if they are traveling, the contactless element of the experience is all the more important, and that is all driven through the Bonvoy app, so as you see more and more people signing up for that experience, that again gets them more invested and they really have an opportunity to see what Bonvoy can do for you. Yes, sure. Again, I think the reality is that we are in a position now where, in many cases, you've got for a full service hotel, it is better to be open than closed, not in all cases but in most cases, but that is really about what is the least bad, so we're still a very long way from obviously occupancy levels that get us to IMFs, because overwhelmingly in the U.S. you've got owners priorities. But at the same time, I'll say with the reduction in cost structure, that I do think that it will help us as we come back to get to incentive fees earlier than perhaps we were before COVID, because of all the work that we've done on the cost structure.  I think the other side of that is obviously wage pressures, and I don't see any sign of those actually going away. I think what we obviously have done is try across every single discipline of our hotels to improve our efficiency and to improve ways that can drive more to the bottom line, so I do think it's certainly that we will hold onto a bunch of these savings in a sustainable way, but I think the wage pressure element on a full service hotel is obviously going to be--you know, with those being, call it 40% of your cost structure of a hotel, that's going to be a big element of how quickly we get back. Anthony, just one follow-up on your comment about business travel, is to remember that in the ballpark of a quarter of the travel in China in our hotels is from international business from outside China, so the fact that business nights, yes, they are down but again you're also having the impact that you're not getting the travelers from outside China coming in. So all things considered, I would--although it's not quite as robust as leisure because people are not traveling outside China, it's still quite robust a recovery on the business side. Yes, I don't have it for you by region. Obviously it's not going to surprise you, we've got big chunks of hotels still closed in CALA and Europe and with REVPAR down in the 70%, that's an extremely difficult process for them. In the U.S., I'll work in getting you some numbers, but obviously it's going to be a far lower percentage. But again, I think it shows you in China the remarkable resilience of both the profits and the revenues from a demand perspective. A couple things. First, again I think you do have to look back at how-you do have to look at China as being somewhat helpful in evaluating how things can come back, so I don't think--although we haven't seen it everywhere else, I think it is instructive.  Then for example, when you've seen in the luxury occupancy at the resorts, you've clearly seen that the leisure demand has moved that up quite nicely when you see the Ritz Carlton brand, for example, had 27% occupancy in the third quarter in North America, and we've talked before about how breakeven occupancy can be around 40%, and that's still with REVPAR for Ritz Carlton being down 64%, so all that to be said is I think it can rebound fairly quickly. I think if you look back and see what happened in the Great Recession, you also had the most complex hotels dramatically impacted by a massive drop in demand, and what you saw is while it took a little bit of time, they did get through it, they did get through to generally not being foreclosed upon, and getting back to strong profits and, in many cases, incentive fees for us. So while I appreciate--we all appreciate that this is going to take longer than any of us would like, I think the most--the guiding light, I know that we see, is how quickly when people feel comfortable about travel, how quickly demand returns and, frankly, rate. All things considered, rate has held up fairly well when you think about big picture, where things are. For example, when you see a quick pop to demand and a drive to luxury resort, you actually see that rate stays in pretty good shape, and again I think we've worked on the cost structure at the hotels to be able to take up some of the slack that has been created from the demand side. You know, you're right about it will depend based on how long this takes, but generally speaking the hotels are in better shape from a leverage standpoint than they were the last go around. I do think the lenders have been quite patient and I think when we get some ability to travel, that the demand is going to come back fairly quickly. Sure, thanks Smedes. I would love to be thinking about those questions. I think for the moment, that's still a little ways off. This will obviously depend on how quick REVPAR come back, and we've got--as you know, we've got leverage ratios that we want to get back in line, certainly on our revolver covenant, to even consider share repurchase and dividends. We need to get back to four times to be able to even consider that, so I think it's a ways off in terms of actual planning. I think one of the things that you know we've been focused on is really thinking about our debt maturity stack, and so that is one of the things that we've done that is more permanent and I think will hold us in good stead as we think about managing our cash flow. When you're not looking at having quite as much in commercial paper, which is so short term and so much more subject to a crisis like this, obviously stretching out our maturities will be helpful, but I think we want to be strong investment grade, we want to continue to be in that range, but we also will obviously be working hard to generate that excess cash flow to consider what to do with it. We like a mix of dividends, of a modest dividend and share repurchase for the flexibility and for the modest ongoing return to the shareholders, and I suspect that we will continue to like that; but exactly where we want to peg the leverage, I think will absolutely depend on the pace of this recovery and the timing of it. And without getting too far into conversations, we've already received some phone calls on that very topic from some of our partners, so I think you can expect there will be some near term opportunities. I think obviously you've got the reality that our large multi-unit partners and our lenders are assessing the situation and trying to figure out the health of their own assets, whether it's the loans or the hotels they own. That is in some cases requiring that they take a bit of a pause, but at the same time these are in many cases folks who are thinking over the longer term and who do have access to capital to get things going, so again as you've seen, we've clearly had a drop in signings, we've had lenders clearly waiting on the sidelines, but it's not to say that all activity has stopped.  Certainly in some of our larger diversified owners, they've got the ability to continue to move forward, looking at pieces of land and starting the process in talking to us and putting deals together, so the conversations certainly get going. I think as you've seen, certainly on the financing front, kind of putting pen to paper and getting committed capital on some deal has slowed, but the conversations absolutely continue. You know, the business has had downturns before, it's a cyclical business, and will again, so I think this I sometimes when there can be some great opportunity, but to really see things pick up in a meaningful way will take that there's more resolution around the COVID situation. Right, well we benefit from it indirectly. We benefit from the standpoint that obviously we need to make sure that what we charge for our programs and services is competitive in a variety of REVPAR scenarios, and as you know, many, many of our charges are actually based on hotel level revenues, so they're a percent of sales, so we've got to make sure that our costs also flex with those changes.  First and foremost, ultimately on the reimbursements, it is a net neutral goal. What you're trying to do over time is to match your costs to your revenues, but also make sure that what you're charging the properties is competitive. So you're right that you see it's positive, but again that's overwhelmingly due to loyalty, and I talked before earlier, that really does flex a bit depending on what's going on with redemption buy-in. We do basically manage it over time to be neutral, as well as all the other programs and services that we charge the hotels for. I was going to say, since so many of the charges that we're charging them flex with revenues, I've got to reduce my costs by that 25%, because remember I can't charge them as much. So when we talk about many of those costs that are above property related to programs and services, that is a function of knowing that as you think about, for example, next year, we're likely to enter into the year not meaningfully different from where we are now, unless there's some unbelievable piece of news. So again, we're just making sure that our cost structure matches what we by contract are able to charge the owners, so that 25% savings is really designed to match what we're charging the owners, but also to try to find ways, as I said in my comments, to actually reduce the rate that we're charging for programs and services, which will then show up in higher hotel profits over time, which should make us more competitive as a manager and franchisor. Does that address your question? Yes, it's from any - independent or other brand. So true!"

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Marriott International\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Arne Sorenson to begin. Please go ahead, sir.\nArne Sorenson: Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone is safe and healthy during these difficult times.  Joining me today this morning are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations.  I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. The lodging industry continues to be profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, and the current operating environment remains quite challenging. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 84%. While April fell 90% the toughest year-over-year comparison on record. Demand has risen steadily since then. RevPAR declined 85% in May, 78% in June; and 70% in July. Many of our hotels that were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 have now reopened. Today, 9% of our global properties remain closed compared to more than 25% in April. Since April occupancy level have increased each month in every region around the world albeit at varying rates. Global occupancy in July hit 31% for all hotels, increasing 19 percentage points from April.  And occupancy in July for the hotels that were opened for each of the last fourth months, reached 39%; growing 23 percentage points over that period. There is still no visibility around when RevPAR could return to 2019 levels; however, the global industry trends experienced over the last couple of months give us confidence that people will continue to increase their travel. We are optimistic that second quarter will mark the bottom and the worst is now behind us.  Greater China which represents 9% of our rooms, over 90% of which are managed is leading the recovery, and has seen rapid improvements in occupancy and new bookings. With the virus mostly contained at this point, many domestic travel restrictions have been lifted; and the number of daily passenger domestic flights is now around 80% of pre-COVID levels. While leisure and drive-to-destinations led the initial recovery; it is encouraging to see business transient as well as group also picking up nicely. Occupancy levels in Greater China have reached 60%, up significantly from the single digit levels in mid-February; and much closer to the 70% we saw at the same time last year. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory; after declining 85% year-over-year in February, RevPAR in Greater China improved to down 34% in July; averaging over 10 percentage points of improvement per month. At the current rate of recovery and assuming no wide resurgence of COVID-19, the Greater China market could approach 2019 occupancy and RevPAR levels as early as next year, even assuming limited international guests. In 2019, nearly 80% of its room nights were sourced from guests within China. Trends in the rest of Asia Pacific are improving at a slower pace as countries are in various phases of reopening and as certain borders remain closed. But the recovery of travel in Greater China demonstrates the resiliency of demand once there is a sense that the virus is better under control, and restrictions can be safely lifted. In North America 96% of our hotels are now open. We are experiencing a steady recovery across all chain scales, although the rate of recovery within markets and by hotel type has varied tremendously. In 2019, domestic travelers accounted for 95% of North American room nights, a benefit in the current environment. Leisure demand has been strong in resort areas, as well as in secondary and tertiary drive-to-markets; not surprisingly our extended stay hotels have experienced the fastest pace of recovery. New bookings in North America have been building nicely led by near-term leisure transient reservations. Despite the recent surge in cases in some states, consumers are increasing their travel. While U.S airline passenger traffic is still well below last year's levels; the number of air travelers the last two weeks of July has more than triple -- was more than triple they are in the first two weeks of May. And system-wide North America RevPAR continued to improve in July to a year-over-year decline of 69%, which is seven percentage points better than June. Historically leisure has made up roughly one-third of our total room nights in North America. The more interesting part of this statistic is that the monthly variance in that percentage is actually quite small. In 2019, the estimated proportion from leisure was around 36% during the summer, and only declined to 32% in September and October. We expect that solid leisure demand will continue through Labor Day in North America and could continue into the fall, as employers and schools alike operate remotely. Business transient in group demand in North America while lagging are showing very early signs of improvement. For now the group bookings outside of those associated with our caregiver and first responder programs tend to be mostly smaller ones such as weddings or travel sports teams. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region or EMEA and our Caribbean and Latin America region or CALA posted the lowest occupancy levels and steepest RevPAR declines in the second quarter. Severe restrictions following rising rates of COVID cases in many countries combined with a much higher dependence on international travelers in these regions have suppressed demand in these regions. In 2019, the percentage of room nights from international travelers was around 40% in Europe, 50% in the Middle East and Africa; and 60% in CALA. 75% of our hotels in EMEA and 70% in CALA were closed for most of the second quarter. Trends in both regions have started to improve recently as the prevalence of cases drops and border restrictions ease. Many of our hotels in these regions are welcoming guests again with under 30% remaining temporarily closed. On the development front, owners are showing great interest in our brands with Greater China again out in front. Greater China contributed nearly one-third of deal signings in the first half of the year with the entire Asia-Pacific region accounting for roughly half of all signings. Owners in the region are taking a long-term view on the market. Year-to-date, we have signed 30% more deals in Asia Pacific than we did in the first half of 2019. The pace of signings is not as robust in other regions around the world largely due to the lackluster lending environment and owner uncertainty. We cancelled one of our monthly deal approval meetings in the spring, which reduced our signings year-to-date, but we are having productive conversations with owners and franchisees, who want to move forward. Some are hoping to see lower construction costs in the weaker economic environment for new builds, while others are interested in conversions to our brands.  Our pipeline totaled approximately 510,000 at the end of the second quarter with over 230,000 rooms under construction or around 45%. The pipeline is 1% lower than at the end of the first quarter with the slowed signings and a few more projects than usual put on hold. While construction activity has resumed in most parts of the world, we still expect some openings will be delayed due to slower construction timelines and supply chain issues related to COVID-19. There is uncertainty surrounding future worldwide room's growth, but given current trends; we could see net room's growth between 2% and 3% in 2020. The final result will depend a great deal on the way the pandemic plays out around the world in the remainder of the year. Over the last several months, we have enhanced our liquidity position and materially reduced our cost structures at both the corporate and property level. We are in constant dialogue with our owners and franchisees, and are working together to navigate these extremely challenging times. As demand returns, we are adjusting our operating protocols and ramping up our business in a thoughtful way. First and foremost, we are focused on the health and safety of our associates, and guests and on communicating these important efforts. We continue to enhance our cleanliness guidelines to meet the health and safety challenges presented by COVID-19. We have mandated that all hotels have electrostatic sprayers to help quickly disinfect public areas, and all properties must submit a monthly commitment to clean certification. And we are increasingly leveraging technologies like mobile check-in, mobile key; and mobile chat between guests and hotel associates to reduce face-to-face interactions, while amplifying operational efficiencies. Additionally, we've announced that guests are required to wear face coverings in the public spaces of our hotels in the Americas, a policy that is also currently in place for associates globally. We are stepping up our marketing efforts around the globe as demand improves. Each region is carefully monitoring social, economic and travel trends, and implementing a phased-in approach based on local consumer sentiment and travel intent. With over 143 million members globally, Marriott Bonvoy, our award-winning Global Loyalty Program underpins all our marketing strategies. We remain focused on engaging our members with targeted email campaigns, and various promotions; such as points accelerators on our co-brand credit cards for gas, dining and groceries; gift card discounts and our current Bonvoy boutiques is sweepstakes for items like bedding and robes. For elite members, we have extended their status through early 2020, and in June credited their accounts with a one-time deposit of elite night credits; allowing them to reach the next tier faster. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I must take a moment to say how proud I am of our incredible team of associates around the world. This has been a time of tremendous stress and uncertainty yet our teams continue to impress and inspire me. I also want to comment on the current social justice movements. As we said in our recent statement, we stand against racism. We believe that racism must be eradicated. Our company believes in equality, justice and putting people first no matter what they look like, here they come from; what their abilities are or who they love. My management team and I are deeply committed to building on our historic commitment to diversity, and to do more to champion diversity, equality and inclusion; both within our company and within the broader community. In closing, while this was by far the most challenging quarter in the history of our company; I am pleased with our progress. I believe we can look forward to a brighter future for travel and for Marriott. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands, superior loyalty programs; strong liquidity position and the best team in the business, I am optimistic about the trajectory of our business in the months and years ahead. And now Leeny, who has ably led our finance team to buttress our liquidity and to set Marriott up with the strength it needs to survive this crisis, will talk more about our financials. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Arne. And I hope all of you and your families are staying well. I also want to express my appreciation to all our associates around the globe for their dedication during these unprecedented times. This morning, I will review our second quarter results and current trends. There's still too much uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of the recovery to give P&L guidance for the rest of the year. But I'll provide an update on the monthly cash burn model that I shared with you on our first quarter call. As Arne noted, second quarter global RevPAR was 84%. Second quarter gross fee revenues totaled $234 million, comprised of $40 million from base management fees; $182 million from franchise fees and $12 million from Incentive Management Fees or IMF. In the first quarter, we did not record any IMF given a significant uncertainty regarding hotel level full year performance. In the second quarter, we had more information and could better predict where hotel performance will warrant IMF recognition for the full year, and as such we recorded IMF fees. The majority of IMF's recognized in the second quarter were at hotels in Asia Pacific, where there is generally no owner's priority with Greater China particularly strong. Almost 65% of Greater China's hotels had positive gross operating profit in the second quarter due to increasing demand, and our ability to control costs. In 2019, over one third of our incentive fees were from Asia Pacific. Within franchise fees, unsurprisingly our non-RevPAR related fees were the most resilient totaling $107 million in the second quarter, down 27% from a year ago. Credit card fees declined to the lower card spend versus last year, while total fees from timeshare and residential branding were relatively flat. Second quarter G&A improved by 22% year-over-year and by 35% excluding bad debt. Bad debt expense is primarily based on our estimate of future credit losses, and is not a reflection of current cash losses. The significant reduction in net administrative expenses demonstrates the many steps we've had to take to reduce our cost structure to align with the decline in revenues in this low RevPAR environment. These steps have included furloughs, reductions in executive pay; and reduced work weeks throughout the organization. We reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $61 million, which includes $36 million of bad debt expense. We were pleased with our lack of cash burn during the second quarter, especially in light of the 84% decline in RevPAR. The additional monthly fees we earned moving from our 90% RevPAR rev car decline cash burn model to the actual 84% RevPAR decline, were better than the $2 million per point per month estimate we gave a quarter ago; as a result of incentive management fees and a bit better credit card fees. Favorable timing of investment spending and cash taxes during the quarter was also helpful. Lastly, strong working capital management and loyalty cash inflows contributed to our overall positive cash position. Given that many of our programs and services are funded by revenue-based charges, we are billing the hotels vastly less than a year ago. We have had to dramatically cut our costs to match this decline in revenues, while still providing the required services. We've been able to reduce current breakeven profitability rates at our hotels around the world by 3 to 5 percentage points of occupancy to help our owners preserve cash. From a working capital perspective, owners and franchisees are largely finding enough liquidity to pay these lower bills albeit more slowly than usual. We continue to work with those owners and franchisees that are challenged to pay on time and for many have set up short-term payment plans. So far this year, we have had only a few hotels go into foreclosure, but our management and related agreements protect us. And historically we have held on to most franchise agreements in that situation as well. The cash burn scenario that I'll outline today is just one scenario, and not an estimate of actual results. Please remember that assumptions for certain line items are not paid out evenly throughout the year; so our averages over a number of months this year. Our overall cash flow is comprised of those at the corporate level, and those associated with our net cost reimbursement. The model I walked you through a quarter ago assumed a year-over-year global RevPAR decline of 90% as we experienced in April. It included monthly averages for several categories of spending like taxes and investment spending; and yielded total net cash outflows of around $145 million to $150 million per month. We've updated this analysis assuming a worldwide RevPAR decline of 70% as we experienced in July. The revised model results in monthly cash outflows of about $85 million, a significant improvement of around $65 million a month; 45% better than the prior scenario. Roughly three quarters of the improvement is at the corporate cash flow level; largely as a result of additional fees due to higher RevPAR. In today's scenario, total monthly fees could be about $110 million per month versus the $60 million to $65 million in fees assuming RevPAR down 90%. The impact of a one point change in RevPAR in our revised model would be roughly $2 million to $2.5 million of fees a month, though the sensitivity is not completely linear given IMS. Improving RevPAR is likely to coincide with higher credit card fees as well. The monthly cash flows cash outflows at the corporate level include cash G&A costs, investment spending, cash interest; cash tax payments, and cash outflows for our owned and leased hotels. Despite the revised RevPAR assumption, the total outflow from these items has not changed meaningfully from the $155 million we described a quarter ago. Although, there are some key timing differences to point out. Cash taxes in 2020 will primarily be paid in the third quarter, while cash interest will be higher in the fourth quarter given the schedule of interest payments for our senior notes. Total investment spending for the full year is expected to be roughly $400 million to $450 million with higher outlays in the second half of the year versus the first half. The lumpiness of these cash flows will naturally impact our cash balances in the third and fourth quarters. All-in-all, the 70% RevPAR decline scenario yields an average total corporate cash burn of roughly $45 million per month, about half of the $90 million to $95 million presented in the scenario a quarter ago. While the absolute cash burn numbers in this model still reflect a tough operating environment; the sizable improvement demonstrates the strong cash flow characteristics inherent in our asset-light business model. The remaining one-third of the cash burn improvement comes from our net cost reimbursement. Today's scenario yields cash outflows of about $40 million a month for this category versus outflows of $55 million in the original scenario. The improvement is primarily due to better matched timing of our cash outlays and reimbursements, as well as continued collections of receivables. This is partially offset by slightly lower cash contributions from loyalty, given redemptions are expected to pick up as occupancy improves. Note that this model does not currently include any severance and other payments associated with our global restructuring initiatives. It's extremely difficult to have to undertake these efforts, which include a voluntary transition program announced in the second quarter, as well as additional job eliminations. The extent of the decline in our business, and our expectation that it will take time for demand to return fully require these measures. We currently expect the total cash charges related to our above property restructuring activities around $125 million to $145 million. In the second quarter, we recognized $26 million of costs related to these efforts of which $6 million was in restructuring and merger-related charges on our P&L, and $20 million was included in reimbursed expenses. We're still working through the details, but currently expect these restructuring efforts will reduce total above property controllable costs, which includes both corporate G&A and program and services costs by roughly 25%. We'll know more about the specific impact on G&A as we work through the 2021 budget process. We're also developing restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to each of our company operated properties, including our owned leased hotels. We expect to implement these plans over the next couple of quarters. In addition to focusing on preserving cash, we've substantially boosted our liquidity, and extended our average debt maturities. During the quarter, we raised $2.6 billion of long-term debt and $920 million of cash through amendments to our credit card deals. As part of our liability management, the $1 billion raised in June was largely used to tender and retire a portion of our near-term debt maturities. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents on hand was around $2.3 billion; adding that cash to the undrawn capacity of our revolver of approximately $2.9 billion and deducting around $800 million of commercial paper outstanding; our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. We believe our strong liquidity position, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets comfortably position us to meet our short and long-term obligations. While there is still a lot of uncertainty, and there are many factors impacting our business outside of our control; we are very pleased with the progress we have made in the areas we can control. Many of the steps we have taken have been painful, but the company is in a solid position to navigate through these challenging times. The global recovery may take longer than any of us would like, but the strong recovery in Greater China and trends in the rest of the world show the resilience of lodging demand and make us hopeful about the future. We all look forward to traveling again and to welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning. And we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from one of Joe Greff of JPMorgan. \nJosephGreff: Good morning, everybody. Nice to hear your voices and thank you for all the information. Arne, I found fascinating your comments about the new signings in Greater China. Can you talk about what's driving that? And can you talk about that maybe the construction cost environment there? And the new signings, how do they compare versus the year ago in that geography?\nArneSorenson: Yes. So the statistic on the last part of that question, we put in the prepared remarks; so we're -- our signings are up over last year about 30% or so in Asia Pacific, all driven by China. And I think the thing to keep in mind in China; one, is about the markets generally obviously the recovery is well apace. I think it's easy to be in China and look at COVID-19 as being not a thing of history quite yet because that probably won't happen until we get a vaccine, and obviously there are events that come up most recently in Beijing, where there need to be some reassertion of restrictions. But those actions get done quickly and by and large the Chinese are back to traveling again. And so I think you've got much greater confidence about the future in the markets generally. And I think secondly, the Marriott has done extraordinarily well in China with the combination with Starwood that we did a few years ago. I think our position in the luxury and upper upscale space if you use the nomenclature from the United States is very, very strong with a dominant RevPAR index position. And I think we end up with tremendous share of the new development in those segments as well as increasing growth of course in the moderate tier with Courtyard, Fairfield and the like, which is moving sort of. And I think in a way you can contrast that with the United States. You could see our total pipeline is down 1%, and I think if you look at the US and Europe by comparison, we're just much earlier in reacting to COVID-19. And I think given the uncertainty about what the path is out of this, I think people are confident; it will get behind us ultimately and we'll get back to a different place. But how long it takes? How the lenders respond? What happens with the supply chain? All of those questions are still very much unanswered I think in the United States.\nJosephGreff: And can you talk about within the pipeline? Obviously, it was down a little bit sequentially and China obviously added on a growth room's basis. How much did you revisit and just come to the conclusion that the likelihood is less today than a few months ago or six months ago or do you think those discussions accelerate from here? How do you view that?\nArneSorenson: Well, I think a couple of things to keep in mind here. One; is that by and large just as it's too early to answer questions about exactly what the shape the recovery looks like in the United States; it's too early to kill projects in the United States. So what we are not seeing on the bright side folks say we've abandoned this project, and decided not to do it. I think on the other hand, if you're not financed; if you don't have your debt financing or if you don't have all your equity raised for a project even if you've been working on it for a number of quarters or maybe a year or two; you're probably not able to complete those financing challenges as well as you would have been before COVID-19 to state the obvious. And even if the financing is done, if construction hasn't already started, it well might be that you're sitting there saying, well, let's watch it here now that over the next number of months and see what happens. We have told you before that in April, I think, we cancelled our hotel development committee meetings and process in the United States. It seemed to be a what -- inappropriate maybe the wrong word, but an odd time I suppose to be bringing in deals that we couldn't really underwrite in a way to know that they were the kind of high probability we would want in order to add to the pipeline, and to some extent our partners couldn't really evaluate them in the same way. And so I think this is a place we watch. Now I think as recovery builds, as we collectively get more confidence about COVID-19 starting to move behind us, and we can obviously talk more about that in this call, I think, we'll see folks who see long-term projects that still make sense; enhanced probably by reduction in costs associated with the construction costs, and other development efforts and we'll probably start to move forward. But it's going to take a while for that clarity to reach the pipeline.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Robin Farley of UBS.\nRobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Two questions; one is on the SG&A reductions that you outlined for this year, how sustainable is that into next year and forward? And then my other follow up is the commentary on business versus leisure travel. I know you mentioned September, October it's still decent levels compared to the summer. Could you quantify how Q4 looks versus Q3 that sort of business versus leisure travel mix? Thank you.\nArneSorenson: Yes. So why don't I take that the latter part first and then Leeny why don't you jump in with the G&A and other spending. We were curious to go back and take a look at the leisure in the fall versus in the summer because I think a lot of us have a little more caution around the corporate traveler than we do around the leisure traveler based on the first few months of recovery here. And somewhat gratifying we see that leisure travel is only about five points lower in terms of total hotel mix in September and October than it is in the summer, going from 35% or 36% to 32% something like that. And what that tells you is leisure may continue to be a pretty significant source of recovery even as we get past Labor Day and into the fall. I think that the corporate traveler has been interesting too. We have watched segments over the course of the quarter; all of us in the industry including Marriott have talked about leisure being the strongest, but interestingly special corporate is probably up five points in terms of RevPAR decline year-over-year in the last two months, just sort of looking at weekly numbers. Our guess is that is driven by business travel in what -- in the Midwest more in smaller companies more than bigger companies in aspects of business, which are less probably dependent on flying. There is still frustration to me that when we -- too often see big, big companies they're making decisions about keeping offices closed for as much as the next year; frustrating to us because in a sense that's just sort of withdrawing from the economy. And while all of us need to make decisions that protect our people, and make sure that we're not putting people out in risky environments before it's ready. There is absolutely no reason for us to be making decisions about what offices look like or what travel looks like in the second quarter of 2021 for example. In any event, I think that the way of putting this is that so far in the recovery every segment has gotten better every month albeit with leisure and drive to being the strongest, we see government rate -- government business up modestly; we see special corporate business up modestly. We basically see that folks are increasingly willing to step out and travel a bit more. So with Leeny maybe you want to take the G&A question.\nLeenyOberg: Sure and I'm going to tag on one other thing, Robin, I think you'd find interesting, which is that to remember that November and December typically actually see the pop-up back up to more summer-like levels for leisure, if you remember how a lot of people do their travel in November and December; so there again that that kind of goes to the same point. On G&A, you've clearly seen just substantial moves that we've made this year and really battening down the hatches and making sure that we're putting ourselves in a position to deal with the decline in revenues. What we've done with the work over the past few months is to really be thinking more broadly about restructuring the company to move forward knowing that it needs to be sustainable, and knowing that it needs to reflect the fact that it's going to take beyond 2021 at least to return to 2019 revenue levels.  So in that regard there when you think about kind of broadly speaking if you remember back last quarter, and I talked about all the reimbursable; a bunch of them were pass-throughs, but there were about $4 billion of our reimbursable that are around delivering the programs and services to all of our hotels around the world and then obviously you've got G&A on top of that. And that is the very large part of cost that we have gone after to try to restructure, and put ourselves in a good position going forward. And that's where I think 25% reduction in that full set of costs is what we're expecting. The details about exactly where that falls relative to G&A, we will work through the budgeting process; so I can't give you a specific number. I think for the rest of this year, as you know we've taken dramatic steps this year whether you call it reduced executive pay et cetera. So I think for the rest of this year you're going to continue to see these really dramatically low levels, but giving you kind of sustainable forward numbers; I think we'll work through that but I would expect them to be quite substantial.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomasAllen: Thank you. Good morning. So, Arne, about three weeks ago you were quoted in the press as saying you were less optimistic than 30 days prior. Can I ask you that question again? How do you feel now?\nArneSorenson: It's a fair question. I guess in on some level I'm -- depends whether you're thinking about the virus or you're thinking about lodging recovery, travel recovery. I am no more optimistic about the virus than I was a month ago. And that was -- that's what caused me a month ago or so to say I'm less optimistic than I was a month before that. I am, however, more optimistic about the recovery of travel; and the recovery of our business. And I think if you read the news every day, which we all do; it's sort of obvious why that's the case. The virus numbers are frustratingly high particularly in the United States, and they remain high; and it is hard to look across the country and see the kind of what strategy that we'd like to see to have confidence that we can put this thing behind us sooner rather than later. Why am I more optimistic about our business? Well, I think if you look at the July numbers as a whole, and we've put some of those in the press release as well as the prepared script; it shows a gratifying resilience of American travelers, American consumers notwithstanding the high virus numbers to get back up. And so 1s of July this virus resurges a little bit, we of course immediately have July 4th weekend which is positive because of its leisure intensive travel aspect. And we see a little bit of a pause maybe in the days after July 4th, but as the month continues; we go back to trend essentially and see occupancy build in each week by a point or a point and a half compared to the prior week. And we end up with July being about five points better than June in the U.S occupancy context. And so that tells I think us that notwithstanding the frustration around the virus numbers, the American traveler and consumer; and I think increasingly the business traveler too will say what we got to get back and live our life. I've got to get back, I'd like to get back to work; I maybe can't get back to the office depending on where I go to the office. Many of you are in New York, which of course has got its own unique set of skills, and I just remind all of you don't assume the United States as a whole has got the same dynamic working as New York does. New York is less dependent on people driving to work; it is much more concentrated in terms of elevator traffic and the like. It's obviously had high virus numbers particularly early in the crisis. You get to much of the rest of the country, and people still commute to work by car. They tend to work in smaller buildings with less a challenge in terms of being able to be there safely. And I think they're more inclined to be stepping back to work, and stepping back towards normal life. So that's what makes me more optimistic than I was a month ago.\nThomasAllen: And just as a follow-up. Are you more optimistic around your net unit growth as you were a quarter ago?\nArneSorenson: About the same I think. I think it is highly likely that we will see a bunch of these new projects take longer to get to opening than we thought before COVID-19. We mentioned this in one of the earlier questions. I think it's still hard to predict with certainty how much longer those things are going to take. But I think we'd be foolish to think that these projects are going to open as quickly as they would have before. We will have some increasing opportunities to offset that in the conversion space. And we've got conversations that are up in the conversion space. I would say there too it's a little early for conversions to actually start moving when you look at prior economic cycles conversion volume tends to step up in weaker environments, but it tends to step up with transactions stepping up. And by and large while there are increasing numbers of hotels that are out there under some pressure, we haven't seen many transactions take place yet. And I think as we do we'll see our conversion ads step up as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Shaun Kelley of BofA.\nShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. I was just wondering, Arne, maybe to stick with a little bit of the same theme. In the prepared remarks you mentioned just in general the business traveler outlook maybe being a little bit more positive, I think, you said for both business travel and group. Just any kind of more specificity if you could give around what you might be seeing? Is it really that drive-to piece, any certain markets or areas and particularly your thoughts on obviously the domestic piece of that would be helpful?\nArneSorenson: Yes. So looking at the U.S for a second and let's make sure we don't oversell this. I want to make sure I get my data. So I mentioned that special corporate is up five points in the last eight weeks, but when you look at RevPAR for special corporate; it's gone from minus 85% eight weeks ago to minus 79% last week. So you're still at numbers which are monumentally negative, and by comparison if you look at retail for example which is where a lot of leisure is going to land; some corporate will land there too it's obviously the sort of rack rate business. We've seen a 15 point improvement compared to that five point improvement special corporate and the RevPAR associated with it is down 57 compared to the down 79 for special corporate. So there is improvement to be sure, and it's measurable essentially week by week; and we would expect it continue to continue. But we would expect corporate to be slower in recovery, and then leisure has been so far; and probably slower to recover in the fall depending of course on the shape of the virus. I'm struck always we've got a -- we live in Washington DC area where we're headquartered obviously. And I've got three kids who live in New York. I've got one that lives in Washington. We have a place on the Chesapeake Bay where we have spent significant portions of the pandemic, and it's interesting to see the different rhythms. So out in the county seat out here where you've got lots of small businesses that are operating; they're all back to work. You can see their surface parking lots are by and large as busy as they've ever been before, and the more you get into the Central Washington, the more you see quiet and I think that is a function both of some restrictions locally, but I think it is a function of you get greater conservatism; you get greater reliance on public transportation or other higher risk tools I suppose than you do in the smaller markets and in the smaller cities. And as a consequence, I think we'll see business travel steadily continue to improve. I would think absent some unanticipated thing in the virus or some calendar event, we'll see that not just leisure but we'll see that business travel improves every week as we go through the fall, but it will be a little bit slower coming back. And it's going to be slowest in the places where the population concentration is highest and where the companies are most conservative.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Patrick Scholes of Truist Securities, Inc.\nPatrickScholes: Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Question on what you might expect for permanent hotel closures? What percent of your system just might not be around in a year or two? And then a follow-up on that is we noticed the EDITION Time Square closed really quickly once COVID hit. I'm wondering what was -- why so quick for that one? Thank you.\nArneSorenson: Leeny, do you want to take that?\nLeenyOberg: Yes. I'll start and then Arne feel free to jump in. So obviously this is all going to take some time. I think what you are seeing so far quite frankly is our dilutions are below average, if you look at where we were in the second quarter and in the first quarter it's below kind of even the % to 1.5% that we guided in normal times. Obviously, though it's really going to depend to some extent on how long the virus persists, and in which areas and to what extent. And then obviously the owner's ability to get through that. So I can't give you a specific sort of estimate, but I'll also say that so far we've seen really strong capabilities on the part of the owners to be able to find access to the liquidity they need to keep the hotels going, and the banks have shown a clear willingness to kind of essentially press pause for a while. And when you think about kind of the depth of what we've seen to have really only a very few hotels already in foreclosure. That I think demonstrates the fact that everybody wants to try to see their way through this. Now we clearly are going to see a bunch of foreclosures through all of this, but that doesn't necessarily mean the hotel is closed. I think in many cases what happens is the banks want to preserve the value of the asset in which case keeping the brand on it is the best way to do that and will do so. And the EDITION is a great example as you've described where the lenders have stepped in, and I think you could actually see that hotel reopen that you saw lots of urban full-service hotels close temporarily to kind of stop and reassess the situation; work really hard to figure out what the right occupancy breakeven is to be open or not open. And I think that you're seeing more and more of them open up. So it's obviously something that is very top of mind for us. We, our North America team and all the teams around the world for that matter are spending just an inordinate amount of time working with the owners; whether it's on kind of short-term payment plans or looking at the FF&E reserves or making sure there's a conversation about our bills and working through the other bills like property insurance et cetera, but again I do think that for the moment it's been a really good pattern for the hotels marching through it. But it does depend a lot on how long this lasts/\nArneSorenson: I think it's perfectly put, Lenny, the -- get to a bottom line. I would guess very, very, very few of our hotels around the world will not reopen if they're closed now or will fail so profoundly that they close permanently. Now in a portfolio of 7,500 hotels or 8,000 hotels, even before COVID-19 hits; there is a handful, maybe a couple handfuls of hotels where profitability is not sufficient for the long-term viability of those hotels. And they're the ones not surprisingly that Leeny and team are working with first in this crisis because they were in trouble before, and when they're in trouble before and you end up with something like this; that's a double whammy. I actually think that the EDITION Time Square is not the poster child for this; it's a brand new hotel, it's a beautiful hotel. I'm optimistic actually that that hotel will open and we'll be fine. But there are hotels in New York City that were not making money before COVID-19 hit, and some of those closed and some of them may not reopen because the cost burdens whether that be labor costs or property taxes or the like, mean that they're -- the owners will not be able to look at them, and say I can see a path towards profitability that I need to have in order to justify this. But I think those circumstances are globally, and in terms of number of hotels or a number of rooms very, very unusual; and I think over time while the owners are broadly under significant pressure, and we've got to make sure that we work with them to build back profitability that the best use for this portfolio of assets, real estate assets will be as hotels and that they will open and be open for the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.\nStephenGrambling: Thanks. This is a bit of a crystal ball question, but how do you think about the impact of work from home, if the recent acceleration holds? And as part of this question, what has been the impact from work from home as you look at corporate relationships or end markets where these trends were the most pronounced over the past 5 to 10 years? And if you were to maybe even peel the onion back further, can you see whether those individual customers in those sectors have changed their leisure behavior along with it?\nArneSorenson: Those are good questions. The last one, I don't think, we've got data that tells us much yet. We've obviously got many business travelers particularly who are not back on the road yet, who are relying on remote work and or technology tools in order to continue to work from home; and to avoid travel. I think the statements that you hear from folks frequently that will never go back to the office or will never go back to travel, I would take with a huge grain of salt. We've heard similar comments in each of the last three crises that we've been through starting in the early 90s; obviously, the technology has gotten better and better. But in 2001 and 2002 and 2008 and 2009, we heard the same thing, which is we don't need to go back to travel the way we've done before. A difference to be sure this time is the remote work kind of context, but you've all got a perspective about this; and I think what we've heard over the last month or so particularly is an increasing level of frustration about remote work. Maybe particularly for folks who are relatively earlier in their career for whom training and networking and pursuit of opportunities depends much more on being present with somebody, but I think even for others; we have gotten to the point of after two or three or four or five months saying this is not -- it's not as good. We can't maintain our culture. We can't bring on new people. We can't train people. We can't invest in the kind of relationships we need to have with our business partners, and with our customers. And I think increasingly we will see folks say, we've got to get back out there and get back at it. And I do think there will be some more flexibility on whether we all go to the office every day when we're not traveling, and we'll see people that can sort of further mix to some extent work in leisure. I think there's a piece of that which will be good for us. So imagine that a year from now or two years from now that week in Florida or weekend the Caribbean, which would have been 100% vacation and I could only do it once a year; I might be able to do twice a year now because I can go down there for a week, and I can do a couple of days of work concentrated or spread out over the work over the week, and have my vacation and to some extent I think that blending of leisure and business could actually be an aid as much as a threat to travel. All things considered, we would say that that we will build back and see the kind of levels of travel demand that we've had in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Anthony Powell of Barclays.\nAnthonyPowell: Hi. Good morning. Question on group bookings, have you seen meeting planners start to book for the second half of next year or any part of next year? And how are you approaching on booking business for your hotels generally right now?\nArneSorenson: So I think the most clear trend, clearest trend which is obvious is that folks that had near-term group business deferred more than cancelled, but basically put off those meetings. I think most of our group customers want to have those meetings, and so that's why they deferred instead of cancelled. And of course, we've been interested in having them defer as opposed to cancel because we just seen that business show up ultimately. And most of those folks are folks who are engaged in hosting those meetings, and they believe those meetings are valuable; and want ultimately to have them. I think at the same time we have seen new bookings for future periods be less robust than they would have been before because if they've not already committed to that meeting; they are probably a little less likely to commit until they've got some greater clarity about what the future looks like. What that means is that so far we've seen business on the books for 2021 not really cancel in big numbers. We've seen group business on the books for 2020 cancel significantly, and I suspect we'll continue to see cancellations for business that has not been cancelled yet or deferred yet as the better word to use for latter parts of 2020 probably continue to cancel until we get some greater confidence around the virus. And ultimately when we get to the point where it looks like group meetings can be had safely, we will see both less deferral of business already on the books; and we'll see new business come in. Give you one statistic I think group business on the books for 2021 compared to what would have been on the books for 2020 a year ago is about down 10%. I think in some respects that we're likely to see the first part -- the first half of next year be meaningfully worse than the second half of next year in terms of group, but that is based on a guess on where the virus is and where the vaccines are. And obviously the more the virus recedes into the background and the more confidence or availability we get in the vaccine, the more we'll see this group business start to build back.\nLeenyOberg: Anthony, the only other thing I'd add is that for 2022 and beyond versus 2021, the rates of decline are meaningfully less. So when you think about the kind of the overall decline, it's nearer in where there's more concern, but when you look at corporate bookings beyond that, it's down much less.\nAnthonyPowell: Thanks for that and separately on Homes and Villas, what have you learned having that business in the portfolio and in this environment? Have you seen more people look for more space? And do you think having that option is increasingly valuable for you in the current future environment?\nArneSorenson: So three things on HVMI, which are consistent with what Homes and Villas by Marriott International I should say, not use our internal lingo too much and expect you all to know it, but our home sharing business has been benefited by three trends all of which we've talked about; leisure, drive -- well two of them we've talked about, leisure, drive-to both advantages and whole home is an advantage. So what people are drawn to in terms of home sharing particularly in a COVID-19 environment is do you have a place where I can take everybody, and where we can be on our own. I don't want a separate bedroom. I don't really want an apartment that somebody lives in regularly. I don't want the old style home sharing because I can't be certain about the cleanliness or comfort of that. But if you can give me a vacation home on the beach or in New England or someplace I can drive to then I know that I can control my environment. I can control my transportation, and it suits my purpose because it's a leisure trip anyway. And so generally that has been a positive thing although to state the obvious it is a very small part of our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedesRose: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just really wanted to ask you assuming whenever this pandemic is behind us, how do you think about the operating model for the owners coming out of this? Since there's been a lot of talk from their end that they can come out with better margin, and that there's been meaningful changes to, I guess, kind of brand requirements. So I'm interested in your thoughts around that, and I guess specifically how do you think the trajectory of kind of in-room housekeeping during a guest stay goes? And am I right and thinking that would be kind of a significant cost savings, if it were to go away?\nArneSorenson: So all good questions and, Leeny, you should jump in here because you've got some good data. I think that will be really helpful. I mean we are working with our owners to make sure that we do everything we can to get back to the kinds of margins they had before if not better. The only caution here is rate and revenue are important, and so the longer it takes us to get back to the kind of RevPAR levels we had in 2019, the more pressure that's going to be on that. And we would make -- want to make sure we're focused not only on the cost elements, but that we are really focused on driving revenue because that's an easier way to get back to margins in many respects. I think on the operating cost side, which is where your question focuses, I think there will be a couple of things that could be sticky. I think one is probably more digital check-in, contactless keys and the like. I think will be adopted more during COVID-19 and could be helpful longer term. I think housekeeping protocols could be interesting. I mean I think we'll see that there is certainly during COVID-19 less intensive or less housekeeping period during a guest stay then between guest stays. That protects both the guests and associates. We have frustratingly seen a couple of cities move in the opposite direction, certainly at the behest of unions to try and bring jobs back. But essentially to say that notwithstanding COVID-19 every room should be cleaned every day, and that should be done as a matter of municipal policy requirement; and in many respects the consequences of that, I think, is we'll see hotels that reopen slower in those markets and we'll see the jobs as a consequence come back slower and at lower numbers than would have been the case without that. But we'll be looking at not just housekeeping and check-in, but we'll be looking at food and beverage and other things to try and make sure that we do what we can to bring back the margins. So that our owners can be healthy, which is in the long-term interest obviously not just of them but of us?\nLeenyOberg: Yes. The only thing I'd add, Smedes, is I think a lot of the work right now that we're doing will help very much in the longer run. A whole lot of the work right now is focused on lowering the breakeven at these lower levels of demand. So whether you're doing things more flexibly around how you're managing certain departments, all the kind of contactless work that Arne was talking about using technology more that frankly will kind of change the way the guests interact with the hotel team. All of those things are tremendously helpful, and as I said, we've kind of globally reduced the breakeven occupancy by 300 to 500 basis points around the world, and that much of that should be helpful in the much longer run. But again as Arne said, we got to kind of got to get back there to have the proof of the pudding. And our goal is to make sure that over the next few years that we get as much cash flow as we can while the demand is still building back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of David Katz of Jefferies LLC.\nDavidKatz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Look, I -- what we've observed across our coverage and in listening to all of your commentary so far, could we see scenarios where the cost basis both for yourselves and the hotel owners; obviously, you're adjusting to a reduced demand environment, but what are you aiming for? Are there scenarios where in the next 12 to 24 months we see a lot less revenue but improved profitability and better earnings for Marriott? Is that what we're ultimately aiming for or are we trying to just sort of hold steady until things get back to approaching 2019 levels?\nArneSorenson: Well, I mean it a little bit depends on what you are comparing to; obviously, the -- we ought to see improving profitability for owners. We ought to see improving profitability, improving earnings; improving EBITDA for Marriott every month and every quarter from this point going forward. Now that's not saying much obviously given the absolute numbers we reported more this morning, but with a fairly high level of confidence you can't say with certainty obviously but with a fairly high level of confidence, the second quarter of 2020 should be the worst quarter we have ever seen by far forever. And things will get better from here. I think as it relates more towards what I think your question was focused out, we have or in the process of nearing completion of I suppose the re-baselining of our business. And by our business I think I mean to include hotels that we manage for others. What our franchisees are doing but what Marriott is doing also. As you all know, we manage a big portfolio of hotels. We manage more hotels in the luxury and full-service space than any other company in the world, and in the managed context of course, we provide services from above property; sometimes there are shared services in a given market, sometimes they're localized by countries; sometimes they're global services think about a reservations platform for example. And the costs of those are paid for by the hotels, which are supported by those services. And we've obviously got our own G&A spending that we do to provide support for our brands. And to provide management of the company and to do all the other things we need to do to manage our business for ourselves as well. But in both of those contexts as Leeny talked about, we are moving towards about a 25% reduction in the gross level of spending between both categories combined. And that's the new base from which we'll build. And we will do our best of course over time to build from that base only at the kind of rates we would have built on the pre-existing base in the past, and are hopeful that we will see RevPAR and fee growth for Marriott and EBITDA growth for our hotel owners grow at a faster pace than the pace at which we're growing costs. And that could well be the case for a number of years.\nDavidKatz: Right. So my point being earnings and cash flow should improve more quickly and hopefully at a better rate than anything we're going to see on the top line for a while. \nArneSorenson: I think that's fair.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.\nJaredShojaian: HI. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And, Arne, it's great to hear your voice on this call. Just going back to China, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of how leisure is performing versus those other two segments? I mean you called out the improvement in business transient group, but anything you can share for us to just kind of contextualize what that looks like? And then with inbound travel restrictions it would seem that demand from Chinese locals is now above pre-Covid, if I understand that right; so correct if I'm wrong there. Do you think intra-China is getting an outsized benefit because there just aren't really outbound options right now? And so you're seeing a substitution of outbound trips for inbound trips?\nArneSorenson: Yes. There's a lot there -- lot of good questions in that. I appreciate that very much. I would say generally that China is coming back in all segments, leisure, business transient and group. You can point at different markets and reach different conclusions. So we've got probably 20 to 25 hotels open in Sanya, Hainan Island, which you can think about as China's Florida. They are doing extraordinarily well, and they are going to be mostly leisure in some group. On the other hand, parts of our Greater China numbers are Macau; Macau is a leisure market and by and large Macau is not reopened, and so that sort of pulls those numbers back a little bit. I think when you look at Shanghai; you look at Guangzhou and surrounding areas, which are much more business travel dependent. I think generally you see fairly strong, very strong recovery certainly from their lows. Remember in February, our occupancy numbers in China were sub 10%. I think 9 and change and we're now running about 60%. So you can see a substantial move. And I mentioned the Beijing context; in Beijing, I think they had, oh, I don't know a couple of dozen cases, and they ended up testing a million people for COVID-19 in 30 days or something like that, and managed to get sort of COVID-19 back under control. The only other thing I think we could say about China and this is maybe odd given the kind of political dialogue that is taking place or political events that are taking place; maybe not that much dialogue is that China and the US are quite similar in the travel sense; demand is overwhelmingly domestic. U.S., 95% domestic; China we have the number of 80% being domestic, but I actually think the number is probably higher than that. China is not a big leisure market for the rest of the world; people some adventurous travelers go to China to see -- to take their vacations, but by and large the international travel is business travel, and overwhelmingly the shift has been towards domestic travel. I think you're right to say that some of that recovery is probably Chinese travel that would have gone abroad maybe to Asia Pacific or to some place else, and has stayed home in China this year. We're certainly seeing the same dynamic in the United States. Nobody's going to Europe and they're more likely to take their vacations here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.\nWesGolladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. My question actually is just a follow-up. Just a quick question on the follow-up to your answer to the last question. Can you give us a sense on trying to gauge how the US could follow Greater China in a recovery? You kind of highlighted both being more of a domestic market, but can you potentially talk about the biggest variances you see in those markets? For example, is the U.S. more dependent on large group compression nights and maybe will lag a little bit longer?\nArneSorenson: Yes. That's a good question. I think the generally what we see in China bodes well for what we should expect in the United States, and there are differences; obviously, but the domestic predominance is similar. So there's really not that much dependence on long-haul air travel for example, probably not that much difference on regional air travel; obviously, China's got a big aviation business and those planes are back flying and they're back flying at bigger numbers than they are in the US. But remember China is two or three months ahead of the US in the COVID-19 recovery. I think the resilience of the American consumer is second to none. And I think we see that already and that sort of was what causes us to be a little bit more optimistic today than three or four weeks ago in terms of the way the business may recover in the United States. I think all of that is either similar or maybe even better. I think the negative is we do have more group business in the United States than we do in China. We as an industry and we as Marriott both, we are whether that be association business or corporate business; the meetings side has been a more established part of business for many, many years. But at the same time, I think there are other compensating factors. I think that we spend more money on leisure travel in the U.S than China does. I'm guessing there a little bit net-net; I would think the recoveries generally ought to look about the same subject to the recovery of society from COVID-19 and subject to the strength of the economy generally. I think you should shelf the last two questions which is how does GDP look in the U.S compared to China when we get through COVID-19 and how does the COVID-recovery curve look like in the United States compared to China. Sorry, Leeny, you were going to jump in on this.\nLeenyOberg: Yes. I should say that the only other difference is when you just look at the fundamental portfolio differences, and that is that there is broader and deeper limited service presence of our portfolio in the U.S than there is in China, which probably at the margin is more skewed towards full service and maybe a bit overall urban. So I think there you're clearly seeing in a limited service portfolio; you're seeing in the tertiary markets, you're seeing this demand come back; so that's the other difference that actually accentuates the positives of North America.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of William Crow of Raymond James.\nWilliamCrow: Hey. Good morning, Arne. You sound well. I hope you are feeling well. Couple of a two-parter on unit growth; the first question is I get that 2% to 3% growth this year, and maybe I missed it but did you talk about how that might bounce back in 2021 and 2022 if these are really just kind of delays in the construction process?\nArneSorenson: Yes. I guess the short answer is, no. I mean I think we will see these projects overwhelmingly become reality is our guess. I mean the certainly when you look at 2008 -09, when you look at 2001or 2002, even projects that we thought were dead often came back, and of course most were never -- we never thought of as being dead. We thought of as being slowed because of financing or construction, while the depth of RevPAR decline is more significant this time; it is particularly tied to one reason. That reason will ultimately get behind us, and I would guess that overwhelmingly these projects move forward again. Whether they move forward to see a bounce back in 2021 or whether it takes us a little bit longer than that. That's the question that's hard to answer. And I think that's going to depend on COVID-19, and I think it's going to depend on the financial markets.\nWilliamCrow: The second part of the question might have something to do with that as well, which are how many requests are you getting for key money? And do you think that the conversion activity that you and Hilton and other peers keep talking about is going to be largely driven by key money that's offered to the owners?\nArneSorenson: We are and Leeny you should jump in on this, but I think we are generally in part to manage our own liquidity and financial resources. We're probably putting less money, less key money and then we've done in the past years for the projects that we are signing today; I think when we get to the conversion market in some respects maybe this is a little bit of wishful thinking, but in some respects the relative value that is achieved by joining a portfolio like ours in a weaker market is more obvious; and therefore the need for key money is less powerful than it would be in a stronger environment where everybody's performing fine. Now whether we can turn that into actual terms of deals that are signed; obviously, depends on our deal makers and the way they negotiate those deals. Leeny, you want to add anything to that?\nLeenyOberg: Yes. The only the only thing I'd say is that the biggest I think question mark, Bill, for the moment is around the lenders, and while certainly on key money it can be a competitive perspective; it is making sure you've got lenders on board to fill the biggest part of your capital stack, and that in many cases really depends on the strength of the brand. The strength of the cash flow that's going to be delivered to the hotel, which I think does lead us back to brands like ours. And while sure key money always competitive, but I don't think on the conversion side that that's going to be kind of the one sole element that then makes or breaks it. I think it has so much to do with the asset value because these are long-term assets. So key money will always be an important part of the discussion, but I don't think on kind of that element in and of itself is really that different from other times.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of one of Chad Beynon of Macquarie.\nChadBeynon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about a booking window what you're seeing in the U.S? If that really changed at all in the last couple months, particularly going into July, if that's kind of still in under a week or if that's starting to expand beyond what we've seen? Thanks.\nArneSorenson: It still very short term. And it shouldn't surprise you because although the occupancy numbers improved -- have improved, we've still got a pretty general availability across the portfolio.\nChadBeynon: Okay and then, Leeny, maybe a hypothetical and a tough question, but regarding some of the positive sequential improvements you've been seeing on the revenue side and the reduction of cost. Should we still assume that North American IMF fees that it's pretty difficult to see a positive outcome just because of the accounting method or do you think if the trends continue we could kind of eke out a positive outcome? Thanks.\nLeenyOberg: Sure. Believe it or not there were a couple in Q2 from North America but it's overwhelmingly from Asia Pacific, and there a whole lot of that's going to depend on Q4. So we need to get farther into the year, but as you might imagine for the North American hotels where you have an owner's priority under most any circumstance you're seeing absolutely massive decline in RevPAR in 2020, and so for this year I think it's hard to imagine that there's anything very exciting to talk about there. But then and when you start talking about rebound, and as demand comes back; I think one of the things that has been good to see is that as demand really picks up rate has also done what demand and supply show it to do, which is that it has also shown the qualities of being quite resilient. So when we think of kind of special corporate rates et cetera for next year. I think again it would point you to a potential view that as demand comes back you will see things pick up nicely. And again, as we've said there's been so much work on the cost side that kind of points to margins being able to be helpful as well. But I do think if you look at our history of North American recovery in IMF; it does take a while because of these owners priority.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Michael Bellisario of Baird.\nMichaelBellisario: Good morning, everyone. Just one follow-up on your net unit growth comments, looking forward what does the split of managed versus franchise growth look like? And are you any more hesitant to take on managed properties today given the working capital requirements that we've seen -- that were so great this last quarter?\nArneSorenson: We are we are no more hesitant to take on manage than we were before, particularly in the luxury and full service space. But I think the question really has to be assessed from a global perspective, and I think given the relatively greater strength of Asia Pacific in our year-to-date adds to the pipeline, if anything we might skew just a tad more managed than franchise, but if you look at it like-to-like our new unit growth in the United States is going to tend to be select service, which is going to tend to be overwhelmingly franchise and obviously those numbers are down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Rich Hightower of Evercore.\nRichHightower: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Good to hear from you. I wanted to follow up on another twist on the China versus North America question. And, Leeny, I think you may have answered part of this to an earlier question, but in the prepared comments Arne you said that both occupancy and RevPAR levels in China might come back to 2019 sometime next year. How much -- so there's a pricing component to that. So how much of the fact that you're talking about lower absolute ADRs translated into dollars and China contributes to that, and how do we sort of think about that versus the recovery and rates in North America, let's say?\nArneSorenson: You're going to test maybe Leeny, can do this, but you're testing my knowledge here. I think it's relatively easy to see RevPAR getting back to 2019 levels in 2021 in China just based on the strength of recovery so far. I can't tell you the split between ADR and occupancy, okay.\nLeenyOberg: Yes. I think again I think occupancy is obviously typically that's the first driver, and that is the one that you can see so quickly, get the pricing back right when you have super high demand over a weekend or over a holiday or a Tuesday through Thursday in a certain urban market then all of a sudden that compression happens very nicely, and you quickly see the rate pop. When we look at how our Chinese hotels are performing relative to the market, I think we all know that the classic RevPAR index things are not great kind of perfect analyses given you got a bunch of other hotels closed. But we have seen that our hotels have performed dramatically better than the industry. So I think again when you see demand for the brand and demand come back that then rate can pick up pretty quickly. I think in North America, we're going to -- it's going to depend more on the segments, right? It's going to depend more on the shifts between retail, special corporate, and leisure and group because they all have some variances. They are on the ADR front, so if you have a fundamental shift on the percentages of group versus retail for example, you might see a difference in rate. But again, we would expect as you see the occupancy pick up quickly to see the rate move fairly quickly. There aren't kind of institutional reasons why the rate is going to behave super differently.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the floor back over to Arne Sorenson for any additional or closing remarks.\nArne Sorenson: All right. Well, I just say thank you everybody. We appreciate your interest and your time. And of course, look forward to welcoming you back to our hotels just as soon as you feel comfortable getting on the road, which we hope is very soon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Marriott International's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Arne Sorenson",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our second quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone is safe and healthy during these difficult times.  Joining me today this morning are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations.  I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts, and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. The lodging industry continues to be profoundly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, and the current operating environment remains quite challenging. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 84%. While April fell 90% the toughest year-over-year comparison on record. Demand has risen steadily since then. RevPAR declined 85% in May, 78% in June; and 70% in July. Many of our hotels that were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 have now reopened. Today, 9% of our global properties remain closed compared to more than 25% in April. Since April occupancy level have increased each month in every region around the world albeit at varying rates. Global occupancy in July hit 31% for all hotels, increasing 19 percentage points from April.  And occupancy in July for the hotels that were opened for each of the last fourth months, reached 39%; growing 23 percentage points over that period. There is still no visibility around when RevPAR could return to 2019 levels; however, the global industry trends experienced over the last couple of months give us confidence that people will continue to increase their travel. We are optimistic that second quarter will mark the bottom and the worst is now behind us.  Greater China which represents 9% of our rooms, over 90% of which are managed is leading the recovery, and has seen rapid improvements in occupancy and new bookings. With the virus mostly contained at this point, many domestic travel restrictions have been lifted; and the number of daily passenger domestic flights is now around 80% of pre-COVID levels. While leisure and drive-to-destinations led the initial recovery; it is encouraging to see business transient as well as group also picking up nicely. Occupancy levels in Greater China have reached 60%, up significantly from the single digit levels in mid-February; and much closer to the 70% we saw at the same time last year. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory; after declining 85% year-over-year in February, RevPAR in Greater China improved to down 34% in July; averaging over 10 percentage points of improvement per month. At the current rate of recovery and assuming no wide resurgence of COVID-19, the Greater China market could approach 2019 occupancy and RevPAR levels as early as next year, even assuming limited international guests. In 2019, nearly 80% of its room nights were sourced from guests within China. Trends in the rest of Asia Pacific are improving at a slower pace as countries are in various phases of reopening and as certain borders remain closed. But the recovery of travel in Greater China demonstrates the resiliency of demand once there is a sense that the virus is better under control, and restrictions can be safely lifted. In North America 96% of our hotels are now open. We are experiencing a steady recovery across all chain scales, although the rate of recovery within markets and by hotel type has varied tremendously. In 2019, domestic travelers accounted for 95% of North American room nights, a benefit in the current environment. Leisure demand has been strong in resort areas, as well as in secondary and tertiary drive-to-markets; not surprisingly our extended stay hotels have experienced the fastest pace of recovery. New bookings in North America have been building nicely led by near-term leisure transient reservations. Despite the recent surge in cases in some states, consumers are increasing their travel. While U.S airline passenger traffic is still well below last year's levels; the number of air travelers the last two weeks of July has more than triple -- was more than triple they are in the first two weeks of May. And system-wide North America RevPAR continued to improve in July to a year-over-year decline of 69%, which is seven percentage points better than June. Historically leisure has made up roughly one-third of our total room nights in North America. The more interesting part of this statistic is that the monthly variance in that percentage is actually quite small. In 2019, the estimated proportion from leisure was around 36% during the summer, and only declined to 32% in September and October. We expect that solid leisure demand will continue through Labor Day in North America and could continue into the fall, as employers and schools alike operate remotely. Business transient in group demand in North America while lagging are showing very early signs of improvement. For now the group bookings outside of those associated with our caregiver and first responder programs tend to be mostly smaller ones such as weddings or travel sports teams. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region or EMEA and our Caribbean and Latin America region or CALA posted the lowest occupancy levels and steepest RevPAR declines in the second quarter. Severe restrictions following rising rates of COVID cases in many countries combined with a much higher dependence on international travelers in these regions have suppressed demand in these regions. In 2019, the percentage of room nights from international travelers was around 40% in Europe, 50% in the Middle East and Africa; and 60% in CALA. 75% of our hotels in EMEA and 70% in CALA were closed for most of the second quarter. Trends in both regions have started to improve recently as the prevalence of cases drops and border restrictions ease. Many of our hotels in these regions are welcoming guests again with under 30% remaining temporarily closed. On the development front, owners are showing great interest in our brands with Greater China again out in front. Greater China contributed nearly one-third of deal signings in the first half of the year with the entire Asia-Pacific region accounting for roughly half of all signings. Owners in the region are taking a long-term view on the market. Year-to-date, we have signed 30% more deals in Asia Pacific than we did in the first half of 2019. The pace of signings is not as robust in other regions around the world largely due to the lackluster lending environment and owner uncertainty. We cancelled one of our monthly deal approval meetings in the spring, which reduced our signings year-to-date, but we are having productive conversations with owners and franchisees, who want to move forward. Some are hoping to see lower construction costs in the weaker economic environment for new builds, while others are interested in conversions to our brands.  Our pipeline totaled approximately 510,000 at the end of the second quarter with over 230,000 rooms under construction or around 45%. The pipeline is 1% lower than at the end of the first quarter with the slowed signings and a few more projects than usual put on hold. While construction activity has resumed in most parts of the world, we still expect some openings will be delayed due to slower construction timelines and supply chain issues related to COVID-19. There is uncertainty surrounding future worldwide room's growth, but given current trends; we could see net room's growth between 2% and 3% in 2020. The final result will depend a great deal on the way the pandemic plays out around the world in the remainder of the year. Over the last several months, we have enhanced our liquidity position and materially reduced our cost structures at both the corporate and property level. We are in constant dialogue with our owners and franchisees, and are working together to navigate these extremely challenging times. As demand returns, we are adjusting our operating protocols and ramping up our business in a thoughtful way. First and foremost, we are focused on the health and safety of our associates, and guests and on communicating these important efforts. We continue to enhance our cleanliness guidelines to meet the health and safety challenges presented by COVID-19. We have mandated that all hotels have electrostatic sprayers to help quickly disinfect public areas, and all properties must submit a monthly commitment to clean certification. And we are increasingly leveraging technologies like mobile check-in, mobile key; and mobile chat between guests and hotel associates to reduce face-to-face interactions, while amplifying operational efficiencies. Additionally, we've announced that guests are required to wear face coverings in the public spaces of our hotels in the Americas, a policy that is also currently in place for associates globally. We are stepping up our marketing efforts around the globe as demand improves. Each region is carefully monitoring social, economic and travel trends, and implementing a phased-in approach based on local consumer sentiment and travel intent. With over 143 million members globally, Marriott Bonvoy, our award-winning Global Loyalty Program underpins all our marketing strategies. We remain focused on engaging our members with targeted email campaigns, and various promotions; such as points accelerators on our co-brand credit cards for gas, dining and groceries; gift card discounts and our current Bonvoy boutiques is sweepstakes for items like bedding and robes. For elite members, we have extended their status through early 2020, and in June credited their accounts with a one-time deposit of elite night credits; allowing them to reach the next tier faster. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I must take a moment to say how proud I am of our incredible team of associates around the world. This has been a time of tremendous stress and uncertainty yet our teams continue to impress and inspire me. I also want to comment on the current social justice movements. As we said in our recent statement, we stand against racism. We believe that racism must be eradicated. Our company believes in equality, justice and putting people first no matter what they look like, here they come from; what their abilities are or who they love. My management team and I are deeply committed to building on our historic commitment to diversity, and to do more to champion diversity, equality and inclusion; both within our company and within the broader community. In closing, while this was by far the most challenging quarter in the history of our company; I am pleased with our progress. I believe we can look forward to a brighter future for travel and for Marriott. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands, superior loyalty programs; strong liquidity position and the best team in the business, I am optimistic about the trajectory of our business in the months and years ahead. And now Leeny, who has ably led our finance team to buttress our liquidity and to set Marriott up with the strength it needs to survive this crisis, will talk more about our financials. Leeny? Yes. So the statistic on the last part of that question, we put in the prepared remarks; so we're -- our signings are up over last year about 30% or so in Asia Pacific, all driven by China. And I think the thing to keep in mind in China; one, is about the markets generally obviously the recovery is well apace. I think it's easy to be in China and look at COVID-19 as being not a thing of history quite yet because that probably won't happen until we get a vaccine, and obviously there are events that come up most recently in Beijing, where there need to be some reassertion of restrictions. But those actions get done quickly and by and large the Chinese are back to traveling again. And so I think you've got much greater confidence about the future in the markets generally. And I think secondly, the Marriott has done extraordinarily well in China with the combination with Starwood that we did a few years ago. I think our position in the luxury and upper upscale space if you use the nomenclature from the United States is very, very strong with a dominant RevPAR index position. And I think we end up with tremendous share of the new development in those segments as well as increasing growth of course in the moderate tier with Courtyard, Fairfield and the like, which is moving sort of. And I think in a way you can contrast that with the United States. You could see our total pipeline is down 1%, and I think if you look at the US and Europe by comparison, we're just much earlier in reacting to COVID-19. And I think given the uncertainty about what the path is out of this, I think people are confident; it will get behind us ultimately and we'll get back to a different place. But how long it takes? How the lenders respond? What happens with the supply chain? All of those questions are still very much unanswered I think in the United States. Well, I think a couple of things to keep in mind here. One; is that by and large just as it's too early to answer questions about exactly what the shape the recovery looks like in the United States; it's too early to kill projects in the United States. So what we are not seeing on the bright side folks say we've abandoned this project, and decided not to do it. I think on the other hand, if you're not financed; if you don't have your debt financing or if you don't have all your equity raised for a project even if you've been working on it for a number of quarters or maybe a year or two; you're probably not able to complete those financing challenges as well as you would have been before COVID-19 to state the obvious. And even if the financing is done, if construction hasn't already started, it well might be that you're sitting there saying, well, let's watch it here now that over the next number of months and see what happens. We have told you before that in April, I think, we cancelled our hotel development committee meetings and process in the United States. It seemed to be a what -- inappropriate maybe the wrong word, but an odd time I suppose to be bringing in deals that we couldn't really underwrite in a way to know that they were the kind of high probability we would want in order to add to the pipeline, and to some extent our partners couldn't really evaluate them in the same way. And so I think this is a place we watch. Now I think as recovery builds, as we collectively get more confidence about COVID-19 starting to move behind us, and we can obviously talk more about that in this call, I think, we'll see folks who see long-term projects that still make sense; enhanced probably by reduction in costs associated with the construction costs, and other development efforts and we'll probably start to move forward. But it's going to take a while for that clarity to reach the pipeline. Yes. So why don't I take that the latter part first and then Leeny why don't you jump in with the G&A and other spending. We were curious to go back and take a look at the leisure in the fall versus in the summer because I think a lot of us have a little more caution around the corporate traveler than we do around the leisure traveler based on the first few months of recovery here. And somewhat gratifying we see that leisure travel is only about five points lower in terms of total hotel mix in September and October than it is in the summer, going from 35% or 36% to 32% something like that. And what that tells you is leisure may continue to be a pretty significant source of recovery even as we get past Labor Day and into the fall. I think that the corporate traveler has been interesting too. We have watched segments over the course of the quarter; all of us in the industry including Marriott have talked about leisure being the strongest, but interestingly special corporate is probably up five points in terms of RevPAR decline year-over-year in the last two months, just sort of looking at weekly numbers. Our guess is that is driven by business travel in what -- in the Midwest more in smaller companies more than bigger companies in aspects of business, which are less probably dependent on flying. There is still frustration to me that when we -- too often see big, big companies they're making decisions about keeping offices closed for as much as the next year; frustrating to us because in a sense that's just sort of withdrawing from the economy. And while all of us need to make decisions that protect our people, and make sure that we're not putting people out in risky environments before it's ready. There is absolutely no reason for us to be making decisions about what offices look like or what travel looks like in the second quarter of 2021 for example. In any event, I think that the way of putting this is that so far in the recovery every segment has gotten better every month albeit with leisure and drive to being the strongest, we see government rate -- government business up modestly; we see special corporate business up modestly. We basically see that folks are increasingly willing to step out and travel a bit more. So with Leeny maybe you want to take the G&A question. It's a fair question. I guess in on some level I'm -- depends whether you're thinking about the virus or you're thinking about lodging recovery, travel recovery. I am no more optimistic about the virus than I was a month ago. And that was -- that's what caused me a month ago or so to say I'm less optimistic than I was a month before that. I am, however, more optimistic about the recovery of travel; and the recovery of our business. And I think if you read the news every day, which we all do; it's sort of obvious why that's the case. The virus numbers are frustratingly high particularly in the United States, and they remain high; and it is hard to look across the country and see the kind of what strategy that we'd like to see to have confidence that we can put this thing behind us sooner rather than later. Why am I more optimistic about our business? Well, I think if you look at the July numbers as a whole, and we've put some of those in the press release as well as the prepared script; it shows a gratifying resilience of American travelers, American consumers notwithstanding the high virus numbers to get back up. And so 1s of July this virus resurges a little bit, we of course immediately have July 4th weekend which is positive because of its leisure intensive travel aspect. And we see a little bit of a pause maybe in the days after July 4th, but as the month continues; we go back to trend essentially and see occupancy build in each week by a point or a point and a half compared to the prior week. And we end up with July being about five points better than June in the U.S occupancy context. And so that tells I think us that notwithstanding the frustration around the virus numbers, the American traveler and consumer; and I think increasingly the business traveler too will say what we got to get back and live our life. I've got to get back, I'd like to get back to work; I maybe can't get back to the office depending on where I go to the office. Many of you are in New York, which of course has got its own unique set of skills, and I just remind all of you don't assume the United States as a whole has got the same dynamic working as New York does. New York is less dependent on people driving to work; it is much more concentrated in terms of elevator traffic and the like. It's obviously had high virus numbers particularly early in the crisis. You get to much of the rest of the country, and people still commute to work by car. They tend to work in smaller buildings with less a challenge in terms of being able to be there safely. And I think they're more inclined to be stepping back to work, and stepping back towards normal life. So that's what makes me more optimistic than I was a month ago. About the same I think. I think it is highly likely that we will see a bunch of these new projects take longer to get to opening than we thought before COVID-19. We mentioned this in one of the earlier questions. I think it's still hard to predict with certainty how much longer those things are going to take. But I think we'd be foolish to think that these projects are going to open as quickly as they would have before. We will have some increasing opportunities to offset that in the conversion space. And we've got conversations that are up in the conversion space. I would say there too it's a little early for conversions to actually start moving when you look at prior economic cycles conversion volume tends to step up in weaker environments, but it tends to step up with transactions stepping up. And by and large while there are increasing numbers of hotels that are out there under some pressure, we haven't seen many transactions take place yet. And I think as we do we'll see our conversion ads step up as well. Yes. So looking at the U.S for a second and let's make sure we don't oversell this. I want to make sure I get my data. So I mentioned that special corporate is up five points in the last eight weeks, but when you look at RevPAR for special corporate; it's gone from minus 85% eight weeks ago to minus 79% last week. So you're still at numbers which are monumentally negative, and by comparison if you look at retail for example which is where a lot of leisure is going to land; some corporate will land there too it's obviously the sort of rack rate business. We've seen a 15 point improvement compared to that five point improvement special corporate and the RevPAR associated with it is down 57 compared to the down 79 for special corporate. So there is improvement to be sure, and it's measurable essentially week by week; and we would expect it continue to continue. But we would expect corporate to be slower in recovery, and then leisure has been so far; and probably slower to recover in the fall depending of course on the shape of the virus. I'm struck always we've got a -- we live in Washington DC area where we're headquartered obviously. And I've got three kids who live in New York. I've got one that lives in Washington. We have a place on the Chesapeake Bay where we have spent significant portions of the pandemic, and it's interesting to see the different rhythms. So out in the county seat out here where you've got lots of small businesses that are operating; they're all back to work. You can see their surface parking lots are by and large as busy as they've ever been before, and the more you get into the Central Washington, the more you see quiet and I think that is a function both of some restrictions locally, but I think it is a function of you get greater conservatism; you get greater reliance on public transportation or other higher risk tools I suppose than you do in the smaller markets and in the smaller cities. And as a consequence, I think we'll see business travel steadily continue to improve. I would think absent some unanticipated thing in the virus or some calendar event, we'll see that not just leisure but we'll see that business travel improves every week as we go through the fall, but it will be a little bit slower coming back. And it's going to be slowest in the places where the population concentration is highest and where the companies are most conservative. Leeny, do you want to take that? I think it's perfectly put, Lenny, the -- get to a bottom line. I would guess very, very, very few of our hotels around the world will not reopen if they're closed now or will fail so profoundly that they close permanently. Now in a portfolio of 7,500 hotels or 8,000 hotels, even before COVID-19 hits; there is a handful, maybe a couple handfuls of hotels where profitability is not sufficient for the long-term viability of those hotels. And they're the ones not surprisingly that Leeny and team are working with first in this crisis because they were in trouble before, and when they're in trouble before and you end up with something like this; that's a double whammy. I actually think that the EDITION Time Square is not the poster child for this; it's a brand new hotel, it's a beautiful hotel. I'm optimistic actually that that hotel will open and we'll be fine. But there are hotels in New York City that were not making money before COVID-19 hit, and some of those closed and some of them may not reopen because the cost burdens whether that be labor costs or property taxes or the like, mean that they're -- the owners will not be able to look at them, and say I can see a path towards profitability that I need to have in order to justify this. But I think those circumstances are globally, and in terms of number of hotels or a number of rooms very, very unusual; and I think over time while the owners are broadly under significant pressure, and we've got to make sure that we work with them to build back profitability that the best use for this portfolio of assets, real estate assets will be as hotels and that they will open and be open for the long term. Those are good questions. The last one, I don't think, we've got data that tells us much yet. We've obviously got many business travelers particularly who are not back on the road yet, who are relying on remote work and or technology tools in order to continue to work from home; and to avoid travel. I think the statements that you hear from folks frequently that will never go back to the office or will never go back to travel, I would take with a huge grain of salt. We've heard similar comments in each of the last three crises that we've been through starting in the early 90s; obviously, the technology has gotten better and better. But in 2001 and 2002 and 2008 and 2009, we heard the same thing, which is we don't need to go back to travel the way we've done before. A difference to be sure this time is the remote work kind of context, but you've all got a perspective about this; and I think what we've heard over the last month or so particularly is an increasing level of frustration about remote work. Maybe particularly for folks who are relatively earlier in their career for whom training and networking and pursuit of opportunities depends much more on being present with somebody, but I think even for others; we have gotten to the point of after two or three or four or five months saying this is not -- it's not as good. We can't maintain our culture. We can't bring on new people. We can't train people. We can't invest in the kind of relationships we need to have with our business partners, and with our customers. And I think increasingly we will see folks say, we've got to get back out there and get back at it. And I do think there will be some more flexibility on whether we all go to the office every day when we're not traveling, and we'll see people that can sort of further mix to some extent work in leisure. I think there's a piece of that which will be good for us. So imagine that a year from now or two years from now that week in Florida or weekend the Caribbean, which would have been 100% vacation and I could only do it once a year; I might be able to do twice a year now because I can go down there for a week, and I can do a couple of days of work concentrated or spread out over the work over the week, and have my vacation and to some extent I think that blending of leisure and business could actually be an aid as much as a threat to travel. All things considered, we would say that that we will build back and see the kind of levels of travel demand that we've had in the past. So I think the most clear trend, clearest trend which is obvious is that folks that had near-term group business deferred more than cancelled, but basically put off those meetings. I think most of our group customers want to have those meetings, and so that's why they deferred instead of cancelled. And of course, we've been interested in having them defer as opposed to cancel because we just seen that business show up ultimately. And most of those folks are folks who are engaged in hosting those meetings, and they believe those meetings are valuable; and want ultimately to have them. I think at the same time we have seen new bookings for future periods be less robust than they would have been before because if they've not already committed to that meeting; they are probably a little less likely to commit until they've got some greater clarity about what the future looks like. What that means is that so far we've seen business on the books for 2021 not really cancel in big numbers. We've seen group business on the books for 2020 cancel significantly, and I suspect we'll continue to see cancellations for business that has not been cancelled yet or deferred yet as the better word to use for latter parts of 2020 probably continue to cancel until we get some greater confidence around the virus. And ultimately when we get to the point where it looks like group meetings can be had safely, we will see both less deferral of business already on the books; and we'll see new business come in. Give you one statistic I think group business on the books for 2021 compared to what would have been on the books for 2020 a year ago is about down 10%. I think in some respects that we're likely to see the first part -- the first half of next year be meaningfully worse than the second half of next year in terms of group, but that is based on a guess on where the virus is and where the vaccines are. And obviously the more the virus recedes into the background and the more confidence or availability we get in the vaccine, the more we'll see this group business start to build back. So three things on HVMI, which are consistent with what Homes and Villas by Marriott International I should say, not use our internal lingo too much and expect you all to know it, but our home sharing business has been benefited by three trends all of which we've talked about; leisure, drive -- well two of them we've talked about, leisure, drive-to both advantages and whole home is an advantage. So what people are drawn to in terms of home sharing particularly in a COVID-19 environment is do you have a place where I can take everybody, and where we can be on our own. I don't want a separate bedroom. I don't really want an apartment that somebody lives in regularly. I don't want the old style home sharing because I can't be certain about the cleanliness or comfort of that. But if you can give me a vacation home on the beach or in New England or someplace I can drive to then I know that I can control my environment. I can control my transportation, and it suits my purpose because it's a leisure trip anyway. And so generally that has been a positive thing although to state the obvious it is a very small part of our business. So all good questions and, Leeny, you should jump in here because you've got some good data. I think that will be really helpful. I mean we are working with our owners to make sure that we do everything we can to get back to the kinds of margins they had before if not better. The only caution here is rate and revenue are important, and so the longer it takes us to get back to the kind of RevPAR levels we had in 2019, the more pressure that's going to be on that. And we would make -- want to make sure we're focused not only on the cost elements, but that we are really focused on driving revenue because that's an easier way to get back to margins in many respects. I think on the operating cost side, which is where your question focuses, I think there will be a couple of things that could be sticky. I think one is probably more digital check-in, contactless keys and the like. I think will be adopted more during COVID-19 and could be helpful longer term. I think housekeeping protocols could be interesting. I mean I think we'll see that there is certainly during COVID-19 less intensive or less housekeeping period during a guest stay then between guest stays. That protects both the guests and associates. We have frustratingly seen a couple of cities move in the opposite direction, certainly at the behest of unions to try and bring jobs back. But essentially to say that notwithstanding COVID-19 every room should be cleaned every day, and that should be done as a matter of municipal policy requirement; and in many respects the consequences of that, I think, is we'll see hotels that reopen slower in those markets and we'll see the jobs as a consequence come back slower and at lower numbers than would have been the case without that. But we'll be looking at not just housekeeping and check-in, but we'll be looking at food and beverage and other things to try and make sure that we do what we can to bring back the margins. So that our owners can be healthy, which is in the long-term interest obviously not just of them but of us? Well, I mean it a little bit depends on what you are comparing to; obviously, the -- we ought to see improving profitability for owners. We ought to see improving profitability, improving earnings; improving EBITDA for Marriott every month and every quarter from this point going forward. Now that's not saying much obviously given the absolute numbers we reported more this morning, but with a fairly high level of confidence you can't say with certainty obviously but with a fairly high level of confidence, the second quarter of 2020 should be the worst quarter we have ever seen by far forever. And things will get better from here. I think as it relates more towards what I think your question was focused out, we have or in the process of nearing completion of I suppose the re-baselining of our business. And by our business I think I mean to include hotels that we manage for others. What our franchisees are doing but what Marriott is doing also. As you all know, we manage a big portfolio of hotels. We manage more hotels in the luxury and full-service space than any other company in the world, and in the managed context of course, we provide services from above property; sometimes there are shared services in a given market, sometimes they're localized by countries; sometimes they're global services think about a reservations platform for example. And the costs of those are paid for by the hotels, which are supported by those services. And we've obviously got our own G&A spending that we do to provide support for our brands. And to provide management of the company and to do all the other things we need to do to manage our business for ourselves as well. But in both of those contexts as Leeny talked about, we are moving towards about a 25% reduction in the gross level of spending between both categories combined. And that's the new base from which we'll build. And we will do our best of course over time to build from that base only at the kind of rates we would have built on the pre-existing base in the past, and are hopeful that we will see RevPAR and fee growth for Marriott and EBITDA growth for our hotel owners grow at a faster pace than the pace at which we're growing costs. And that could well be the case for a number of years. I think that's fair. Yes. There's a lot there -- lot of good questions in that. I appreciate that very much. I would say generally that China is coming back in all segments, leisure, business transient and group. You can point at different markets and reach different conclusions. So we've got probably 20 to 25 hotels open in Sanya, Hainan Island, which you can think about as China's Florida. They are doing extraordinarily well, and they are going to be mostly leisure in some group. On the other hand, parts of our Greater China numbers are Macau; Macau is a leisure market and by and large Macau is not reopened, and so that sort of pulls those numbers back a little bit. I think when you look at Shanghai; you look at Guangzhou and surrounding areas, which are much more business travel dependent. I think generally you see fairly strong, very strong recovery certainly from their lows. Remember in February, our occupancy numbers in China were sub 10%. I think 9 and change and we're now running about 60%. So you can see a substantial move. And I mentioned the Beijing context; in Beijing, I think they had, oh, I don't know a couple of dozen cases, and they ended up testing a million people for COVID-19 in 30 days or something like that, and managed to get sort of COVID-19 back under control. The only other thing I think we could say about China and this is maybe odd given the kind of political dialogue that is taking place or political events that are taking place; maybe not that much dialogue is that China and the US are quite similar in the travel sense; demand is overwhelmingly domestic. U.S., 95% domestic; China we have the number of 80% being domestic, but I actually think the number is probably higher than that. China is not a big leisure market for the rest of the world; people some adventurous travelers go to China to see -- to take their vacations, but by and large the international travel is business travel, and overwhelmingly the shift has been towards domestic travel. I think you're right to say that some of that recovery is probably Chinese travel that would have gone abroad maybe to Asia Pacific or to some place else, and has stayed home in China this year. We're certainly seeing the same dynamic in the United States. Nobody's going to Europe and they're more likely to take their vacations here. Yes. That's a good question. I think the generally what we see in China bodes well for what we should expect in the United States, and there are differences; obviously, but the domestic predominance is similar. So there's really not that much dependence on long-haul air travel for example, probably not that much difference on regional air travel; obviously, China's got a big aviation business and those planes are back flying and they're back flying at bigger numbers than they are in the US. But remember China is two or three months ahead of the US in the COVID-19 recovery. I think the resilience of the American consumer is second to none. And I think we see that already and that sort of was what causes us to be a little bit more optimistic today than three or four weeks ago in terms of the way the business may recover in the United States. I think all of that is either similar or maybe even better. I think the negative is we do have more group business in the United States than we do in China. We as an industry and we as Marriott both, we are whether that be association business or corporate business; the meetings side has been a more established part of business for many, many years. But at the same time, I think there are other compensating factors. I think that we spend more money on leisure travel in the U.S than China does. I'm guessing there a little bit net-net; I would think the recoveries generally ought to look about the same subject to the recovery of society from COVID-19 and subject to the strength of the economy generally. I think you should shelf the last two questions which is how does GDP look in the U.S compared to China when we get through COVID-19 and how does the COVID-recovery curve look like in the United States compared to China. Sorry, Leeny, you were going to jump in on this. Yes. I guess the short answer is, no. I mean I think we will see these projects overwhelmingly become reality is our guess. I mean the certainly when you look at 2008 -09, when you look at 2001or 2002, even projects that we thought were dead often came back, and of course most were never -- we never thought of as being dead. We thought of as being slowed because of financing or construction, while the depth of RevPAR decline is more significant this time; it is particularly tied to one reason. That reason will ultimately get behind us, and I would guess that overwhelmingly these projects move forward again. Whether they move forward to see a bounce back in 2021 or whether it takes us a little bit longer than that. That's the question that's hard to answer. And I think that's going to depend on COVID-19, and I think it's going to depend on the financial markets. We are and Leeny you should jump in on this, but I think we are generally in part to manage our own liquidity and financial resources. We're probably putting less money, less key money and then we've done in the past years for the projects that we are signing today; I think when we get to the conversion market in some respects maybe this is a little bit of wishful thinking, but in some respects the relative value that is achieved by joining a portfolio like ours in a weaker market is more obvious; and therefore the need for key money is less powerful than it would be in a stronger environment where everybody's performing fine. Now whether we can turn that into actual terms of deals that are signed; obviously, depends on our deal makers and the way they negotiate those deals. Leeny, you want to add anything to that? It still very short term. And it shouldn't surprise you because although the occupancy numbers improved -- have improved, we've still got a pretty general availability across the portfolio. We are we are no more hesitant to take on manage than we were before, particularly in the luxury and full service space. But I think the question really has to be assessed from a global perspective, and I think given the relatively greater strength of Asia Pacific in our year-to-date adds to the pipeline, if anything we might skew just a tad more managed than franchise, but if you look at it like-to-like our new unit growth in the United States is going to tend to be select service, which is going to tend to be overwhelmingly franchise and obviously those numbers are down. You're going to test maybe Leeny, can do this, but you're testing my knowledge here. I think it's relatively easy to see RevPAR getting back to 2019 levels in 2021 in China just based on the strength of recovery so far. I can't tell you the split between ADR and occupancy, okay. All right. Well, I just say thank you everybody. We appreciate your interest and your time. And of course, look forward to welcoming you back to our hotels just as soon as you feel comfortable getting on the road, which we hope is very soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Arne. And I hope all of you and your families are staying well. I also want to express my appreciation to all our associates around the globe for their dedication during these unprecedented times. This morning, I will review our second quarter results and current trends. There's still too much uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of the recovery to give P&L guidance for the rest of the year. But I'll provide an update on the monthly cash burn model that I shared with you on our first quarter call. As Arne noted, second quarter global RevPAR was 84%. Second quarter gross fee revenues totaled $234 million, comprised of $40 million from base management fees; $182 million from franchise fees and $12 million from Incentive Management Fees or IMF. In the first quarter, we did not record any IMF given a significant uncertainty regarding hotel level full year performance. In the second quarter, we had more information and could better predict where hotel performance will warrant IMF recognition for the full year, and as such we recorded IMF fees. The majority of IMF's recognized in the second quarter were at hotels in Asia Pacific, where there is generally no owner's priority with Greater China particularly strong. Almost 65% of Greater China's hotels had positive gross operating profit in the second quarter due to increasing demand, and our ability to control costs. In 2019, over one third of our incentive fees were from Asia Pacific. Within franchise fees, unsurprisingly our non-RevPAR related fees were the most resilient totaling $107 million in the second quarter, down 27% from a year ago. Credit card fees declined to the lower card spend versus last year, while total fees from timeshare and residential branding were relatively flat. Second quarter G&A improved by 22% year-over-year and by 35% excluding bad debt. Bad debt expense is primarily based on our estimate of future credit losses, and is not a reflection of current cash losses. The significant reduction in net administrative expenses demonstrates the many steps we've had to take to reduce our cost structure to align with the decline in revenues in this low RevPAR environment. These steps have included furloughs, reductions in executive pay; and reduced work weeks throughout the organization. We reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $61 million, which includes $36 million of bad debt expense. We were pleased with our lack of cash burn during the second quarter, especially in light of the 84% decline in RevPAR. The additional monthly fees we earned moving from our 90% RevPAR rev car decline cash burn model to the actual 84% RevPAR decline, were better than the $2 million per point per month estimate we gave a quarter ago; as a result of incentive management fees and a bit better credit card fees. Favorable timing of investment spending and cash taxes during the quarter was also helpful. Lastly, strong working capital management and loyalty cash inflows contributed to our overall positive cash position. Given that many of our programs and services are funded by revenue-based charges, we are billing the hotels vastly less than a year ago. We have had to dramatically cut our costs to match this decline in revenues, while still providing the required services. We've been able to reduce current breakeven profitability rates at our hotels around the world by 3 to 5 percentage points of occupancy to help our owners preserve cash. From a working capital perspective, owners and franchisees are largely finding enough liquidity to pay these lower bills albeit more slowly than usual. We continue to work with those owners and franchisees that are challenged to pay on time and for many have set up short-term payment plans. So far this year, we have had only a few hotels go into foreclosure, but our management and related agreements protect us. And historically we have held on to most franchise agreements in that situation as well. The cash burn scenario that I'll outline today is just one scenario, and not an estimate of actual results. Please remember that assumptions for certain line items are not paid out evenly throughout the year; so our averages over a number of months this year. Our overall cash flow is comprised of those at the corporate level, and those associated with our net cost reimbursement. The model I walked you through a quarter ago assumed a year-over-year global RevPAR decline of 90% as we experienced in April. It included monthly averages for several categories of spending like taxes and investment spending; and yielded total net cash outflows of around $145 million to $150 million per month. We've updated this analysis assuming a worldwide RevPAR decline of 70% as we experienced in July. The revised model results in monthly cash outflows of about $85 million, a significant improvement of around $65 million a month; 45% better than the prior scenario. Roughly three quarters of the improvement is at the corporate cash flow level; largely as a result of additional fees due to higher RevPAR. In today's scenario, total monthly fees could be about $110 million per month versus the $60 million to $65 million in fees assuming RevPAR down 90%. The impact of a one point change in RevPAR in our revised model would be roughly $2 million to $2.5 million of fees a month, though the sensitivity is not completely linear given IMS. Improving RevPAR is likely to coincide with higher credit card fees as well. The monthly cash flows cash outflows at the corporate level include cash G&A costs, investment spending, cash interest; cash tax payments, and cash outflows for our owned and leased hotels. Despite the revised RevPAR assumption, the total outflow from these items has not changed meaningfully from the $155 million we described a quarter ago. Although, there are some key timing differences to point out. Cash taxes in 2020 will primarily be paid in the third quarter, while cash interest will be higher in the fourth quarter given the schedule of interest payments for our senior notes. Total investment spending for the full year is expected to be roughly $400 million to $450 million with higher outlays in the second half of the year versus the first half. The lumpiness of these cash flows will naturally impact our cash balances in the third and fourth quarters. All-in-all, the 70% RevPAR decline scenario yields an average total corporate cash burn of roughly $45 million per month, about half of the $90 million to $95 million presented in the scenario a quarter ago. While the absolute cash burn numbers in this model still reflect a tough operating environment; the sizable improvement demonstrates the strong cash flow characteristics inherent in our asset-light business model. The remaining one-third of the cash burn improvement comes from our net cost reimbursement. Today's scenario yields cash outflows of about $40 million a month for this category versus outflows of $55 million in the original scenario. The improvement is primarily due to better matched timing of our cash outlays and reimbursements, as well as continued collections of receivables. This is partially offset by slightly lower cash contributions from loyalty, given redemptions are expected to pick up as occupancy improves. Note that this model does not currently include any severance and other payments associated with our global restructuring initiatives. It's extremely difficult to have to undertake these efforts, which include a voluntary transition program announced in the second quarter, as well as additional job eliminations. The extent of the decline in our business, and our expectation that it will take time for demand to return fully require these measures. We currently expect the total cash charges related to our above property restructuring activities around $125 million to $145 million. In the second quarter, we recognized $26 million of costs related to these efforts of which $6 million was in restructuring and merger-related charges on our P&L, and $20 million was included in reimbursed expenses. We're still working through the details, but currently expect these restructuring efforts will reduce total above property controllable costs, which includes both corporate G&A and program and services costs by roughly 25%. We'll know more about the specific impact on G&A as we work through the 2021 budget process. We're also developing restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to each of our company operated properties, including our owned leased hotels. We expect to implement these plans over the next couple of quarters. In addition to focusing on preserving cash, we've substantially boosted our liquidity, and extended our average debt maturities. During the quarter, we raised $2.6 billion of long-term debt and $920 million of cash through amendments to our credit card deals. As part of our liability management, the $1 billion raised in June was largely used to tender and retire a portion of our near-term debt maturities. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents on hand was around $2.3 billion; adding that cash to the undrawn capacity of our revolver of approximately $2.9 billion and deducting around $800 million of commercial paper outstanding; our net liquidity was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. We believe our strong liquidity position, cash flow from operations and access to capital markets comfortably position us to meet our short and long-term obligations. While there is still a lot of uncertainty, and there are many factors impacting our business outside of our control; we are very pleased with the progress we have made in the areas we can control. Many of the steps we have taken have been painful, but the company is in a solid position to navigate through these challenging times. The global recovery may take longer than any of us would like, but the strong recovery in Greater China and trends in the rest of the world show the resilience of lodging demand and make us hopeful about the future. We all look forward to traveling again and to welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning. And we'll now open the line for questions. Sure and I'm going to tag on one other thing, Robin, I think you'd find interesting, which is that to remember that November and December typically actually see the pop-up back up to more summer-like levels for leisure, if you remember how a lot of people do their travel in November and December; so there again that that kind of goes to the same point. On G&A, you've clearly seen just substantial moves that we've made this year and really battening down the hatches and making sure that we're putting ourselves in a position to deal with the decline in revenues. What we've done with the work over the past few months is to really be thinking more broadly about restructuring the company to move forward knowing that it needs to be sustainable, and knowing that it needs to reflect the fact that it's going to take beyond 2021 at least to return to 2019 revenue levels.  So in that regard there when you think about kind of broadly speaking if you remember back last quarter, and I talked about all the reimbursable; a bunch of them were pass-throughs, but there were about $4 billion of our reimbursable that are around delivering the programs and services to all of our hotels around the world and then obviously you've got G&A on top of that. And that is the very large part of cost that we have gone after to try to restructure, and put ourselves in a good position going forward. And that's where I think 25% reduction in that full set of costs is what we're expecting. The details about exactly where that falls relative to G&A, we will work through the budgeting process; so I can't give you a specific number. I think for the rest of this year, as you know we've taken dramatic steps this year whether you call it reduced executive pay et cetera. So I think for the rest of this year you're going to continue to see these really dramatically low levels, but giving you kind of sustainable forward numbers; I think we'll work through that but I would expect them to be quite substantial. Yes. I'll start and then Arne feel free to jump in. So obviously this is all going to take some time. I think what you are seeing so far quite frankly is our dilutions are below average, if you look at where we were in the second quarter and in the first quarter it's below kind of even the % to 1.5% that we guided in normal times. Obviously, though it's really going to depend to some extent on how long the virus persists, and in which areas and to what extent. And then obviously the owner's ability to get through that. So I can't give you a specific sort of estimate, but I'll also say that so far we've seen really strong capabilities on the part of the owners to be able to find access to the liquidity they need to keep the hotels going, and the banks have shown a clear willingness to kind of essentially press pause for a while. And when you think about kind of the depth of what we've seen to have really only a very few hotels already in foreclosure. That I think demonstrates the fact that everybody wants to try to see their way through this. Now we clearly are going to see a bunch of foreclosures through all of this, but that doesn't necessarily mean the hotel is closed. I think in many cases what happens is the banks want to preserve the value of the asset in which case keeping the brand on it is the best way to do that and will do so. And the EDITION is a great example as you've described where the lenders have stepped in, and I think you could actually see that hotel reopen that you saw lots of urban full-service hotels close temporarily to kind of stop and reassess the situation; work really hard to figure out what the right occupancy breakeven is to be open or not open. And I think that you're seeing more and more of them open up. So it's obviously something that is very top of mind for us. We, our North America team and all the teams around the world for that matter are spending just an inordinate amount of time working with the owners; whether it's on kind of short-term payment plans or looking at the FF&E reserves or making sure there's a conversation about our bills and working through the other bills like property insurance et cetera, but again I do think that for the moment it's been a really good pattern for the hotels marching through it. But it does depend a lot on how long this lasts/ Anthony, the only other thing I'd add is that for 2022 and beyond versus 2021, the rates of decline are meaningfully less. So when you think about the kind of the overall decline, it's nearer in where there's more concern, but when you look at corporate bookings beyond that, it's down much less. Yes. The only thing I'd add, Smedes, is I think a lot of the work right now that we're doing will help very much in the longer run. A whole lot of the work right now is focused on lowering the breakeven at these lower levels of demand. So whether you're doing things more flexibly around how you're managing certain departments, all the kind of contactless work that Arne was talking about using technology more that frankly will kind of change the way the guests interact with the hotel team. All of those things are tremendously helpful, and as I said, we've kind of globally reduced the breakeven occupancy by 300 to 500 basis points around the world, and that much of that should be helpful in the much longer run. But again as Arne said, we got to kind of got to get back there to have the proof of the pudding. And our goal is to make sure that over the next few years that we get as much cash flow as we can while the demand is still building back. Yes. I should say that the only other difference is when you just look at the fundamental portfolio differences, and that is that there is broader and deeper limited service presence of our portfolio in the U.S than there is in China, which probably at the margin is more skewed towards full service and maybe a bit overall urban. So I think there you're clearly seeing in a limited service portfolio; you're seeing in the tertiary markets, you're seeing this demand come back; so that's the other difference that actually accentuates the positives of North America. Yes. The only the only thing I'd say is that the biggest I think question mark, Bill, for the moment is around the lenders, and while certainly on key money it can be a competitive perspective; it is making sure you've got lenders on board to fill the biggest part of your capital stack, and that in many cases really depends on the strength of the brand. The strength of the cash flow that's going to be delivered to the hotel, which I think does lead us back to brands like ours. And while sure key money always competitive, but I don't think on the conversion side that that's going to be kind of the one sole element that then makes or breaks it. I think it has so much to do with the asset value because these are long-term assets. So key money will always be an important part of the discussion, but I don't think on kind of that element in and of itself is really that different from other times. Sure. Believe it or not there were a couple in Q2 from North America but it's overwhelmingly from Asia Pacific, and there a whole lot of that's going to depend on Q4. So we need to get farther into the year, but as you might imagine for the North American hotels where you have an owner's priority under most any circumstance you're seeing absolutely massive decline in RevPAR in 2020, and so for this year I think it's hard to imagine that there's anything very exciting to talk about there. But then and when you start talking about rebound, and as demand comes back; I think one of the things that has been good to see is that as demand really picks up rate has also done what demand and supply show it to do, which is that it has also shown the qualities of being quite resilient. So when we think of kind of special corporate rates et cetera for next year. I think again it would point you to a potential view that as demand comes back you will see things pick up nicely. And again, as we've said there's been so much work on the cost side that kind of points to margins being able to be helpful as well. But I do think if you look at our history of North American recovery in IMF; it does take a while because of these owners priority. Yes. I think again I think occupancy is obviously typically that's the first driver, and that is the one that you can see so quickly, get the pricing back right when you have super high demand over a weekend or over a holiday or a Tuesday through Thursday in a certain urban market then all of a sudden that compression happens very nicely, and you quickly see the rate pop. When we look at how our Chinese hotels are performing relative to the market, I think we all know that the classic RevPAR index things are not great kind of perfect analyses given you got a bunch of other hotels closed. But we have seen that our hotels have performed dramatically better than the industry. So I think again when you see demand for the brand and demand come back that then rate can pick up pretty quickly. I think in North America, we're going to -- it's going to depend more on the segments, right? It's going to depend more on the shifts between retail, special corporate, and leisure and group because they all have some variances. They are on the ADR front, so if you have a fundamental shift on the percentages of group versus retail for example, you might see a difference in rate. But again, we would expect as you see the occupancy pick up quickly to see the rate move fairly quickly. There aren't kind of institutional reasons why the rate is going to behave super differently."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Marriott International\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Arne Sorenson. Please go ahead, sir.\nArne Sorenson: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone and their families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented and challenging times. And I would like to send my deepest condolences to those of you who have lost friends or family because of COVID-19. Please know that our thoughts are with you. Joining me today from their respective homes are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations. I believe this is the first time that Marriott team has not been together in the same room to host this call. And that includes an earnings call from China in 2018 and one during a blizzard in 2010. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Let me begin with what is clearly top of mind for all of you, how Marriott is navigating through the extraordinary and continually evolving worldwide impact of COVID-19. This is by far the most significant crisis ever to impact our business. We\u2019re a company that is 92 years old and has weathered the Great Depression, World War II, and numerous natural disasters around the world, that is saying something. Well, the year generally got off to a great start. We saw sudden sharp declines in occupancy associated with COVID-19, beginning in Greater China in January and then extending around the world. Occupancy continued to deteriorate in March and then stabilized in April, albeit at very low levels everywhere except for Greater China, where trends are improving. RevPAR in April fell 90% worldwide and in North America as well. April system-wide occupancy was 12% both worldwide and in North America. For the week ending May 2, worldwide occupancy was 15% and 20% when just looking at comparable hotels that were actually open. About 25% of our hotels worldwide are temporarily closed with 16% of our North American portfolio temporarily closed. Europe is mostly shut down with just over three-quarters of our hotels closed right now. To state the obvious, we are operating in a very challenging environment. However, the glimmer of good news is that overall negative trends appear to have bottomed in most regions around the world. The resiliency of demand is evident in the improving trends in Greater China. New bookings continue to pick up with demand driven primarily by domestic travelers. Occupancy levels in Greater China are currently just over 30%, up from the lows of under 10% in mid-February. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory, currently down around 67% year-over-year compared to an 85% decline in February. Throughout Mainland China, leisure demand was strong for the Chinese Labor Day holiday weekend in early May. Occupancy for that weekend was over 45% with resort markets close to 70%. We have seen examples of demand starting to come back in other areas around the world as well. Last weekend, as some beaches reopened, the Ritz-Carlton Bacara in Santa Barbara and our hotels in Hilton Head, South Carolina, for example, were expected to reach approximately 50% occupancy based on reservations on the book. Limited service occupancy in the US has increased a bit each week over the past few weeks, showing the most meaningful improvements in drive-to destinations. Local, state and national governments are trying to manage the tight rope between containing COVID-19 and restarting their economies. There are likely to be some areas that start slower, some faster, and some that open in fits and starts. But our business should improve as restrictions are relaxed. On the development front, our pipeline increased slightly to a very healthy 516,000 rooms at the end of the first quarter. We opened over 14,000 rooms in the first quarter and at quarter end. Over 230,000 rooms in our pipeline or around 45% were under construction. We do expect some hotel openings will be delayed due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues or local restrictions on construction activity, but at this point, we have not seen more deals than usual dropping out of the pipeline. The pace of new deal signings overall has slowed a bit as a result of the crisis, but we are encouraged by our current conversations with owners. Many continue to have a clear preference for our portfolio of brands which posted worldwide RevPAR index gains of 330 basis points in the first two months of the year. Like us, many owners are taking a longer term view on the market opportunity. In the first quarter, our Asia Pacific region saw meaningful development activity with over 9,000 rooms signed, roughly 45% more than in the year-ago quarter. And we continue to see strong interest from owners in North America, even though they are not feeling a sense of urgency to get deals across the finish line. We cancelled our North America monthly development deal approval meeting in March for the first time in more than a decade, to pause and take stock of the environment, given the dramatic pace at which COVID-19 was impacting the industry, but have now returned to our usual meeting cadence. We continue to do what we can do across all areas of our business to respond to the current environment. We have issued several updates on the numerous actions we have taken which have focused on helping our associates, our guests, our hotel owners and franchisees and the company itself manage through this situation. While no one can know exactly when and how demand will start to return in each part of the world, Marriott is ready. We have swiftly made significant short-term changes to our business and enhanced our liquidity position, while remaining focused on how to best position ourselves for the recovery and for growth over the longer term. As global trends have started to stabilize, teams across the company have been diligently monitoring various data points and developing a cross-discipline recovery plan. In addition to tracking the booking and cancelation information and macroeconomic indicators, we are also looking at data around COVID-19 testing and cases and government regulations, all with an eye towards ramping up our business in a thoughtful way as restrictions are lifted and market conditions improve. We are consulting with our owners to analyze potential market demand and hotel-level cash flow to help inform when and how to reopen their hotels. Region-specific marketing strategies are being developed that we plan to roll out in phases as different customer segments and levels of demand return. A key component of our marketing plans will be leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and focusing on reaching our highly engaged member base and our many Marriott Bonvoy credit cardholders. Throughout this crisis, we have continued to communicate with our loyalty members, including with special promotions on our co-brand credit cards in the US, such as our offer for six times points on groceries. We have also extended elite benefits, and today, to help spark demand, we will announce a new promotion to buy gift cards for future hotel stays at a 20% discount. In Greater China, our joint venture with Alibaba has been very helpful in rebuilding demand. A recent spring sale run by Alibaba\u2019s Fliggy travel site was very successful and generated terrific near-term bookings. Bookings from Ctrip have also grown significantly over the past few weeks and are up over 15% for the first week of May versus the same time last year. Another key component of our recovery plan is communicating with our guests and associates about our focus on health and safety, and giving them the confidence they need to travel and stay with us. We recently announced enhanced global cleanliness guidelines, focused on elevating cleanliness levels and hospitality norms to meet the health and safety challenges presented by the new environment. We are also working to reduce the frequency of contact between associates and guests by continuing to roll out programs such as mobile check-in, mobile key and no-contact room service. I want to take moment to express my appreciation to our team of associates around the world. Amidst furloughs, reduced workweeks, temporary hotel closures, new cleaning requirements and very lean operation staffing, they continue to inspire me every day. Their constant messages to me of hope and belief in Marriott remind me over and over that we are so fortunate to have the best team in the business. The recovery is not going to happen uniformly across all regions and it is not going to occur overnight. It may take longer than any of us would like and we will likely operate a bit differently going forward, but we have taken the steps necessary to position the company to manage through this crisis successfully, and travel will rebound. Our people, our solid financial footing, our 30 industry-leading brands and our number one Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program continue to point toward a brighter future. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to share some organizational news. Dave Grissen, our current Head of the Americas, has decided to step down from his position as Group President of the Americas in the first quarter of 2021 after a 36-year career with Marriott. Dave and I started talking about his potential retirement last year, but neither he nor I felt the time was right to finalize any retirement. As we moved into 2020 and increasingly turned toward questions around how we will rebuild our business and our company on the other side of COVID-19, it became obvious that we needed our new leaders to be fully engaged in this process. Dave will be with us through Q1, allowing for a smooth and thoughtful transition, but he will be missed by all of us and we wish him all the best as he ventures into the next phase of his life. Dave, thank you for your extraordinary contributions to Marriott. Starting in 2021, we will remain organized in a continent structure, but our global lodging business will be consolidated under two fantastic veteran leaders: Liam Brown, the current Head of EMEA, will oversee North America; and Craig Smith, our current Head of Asia Pacific, will oversee all international regions outside of North America. Liam and Craig are excellent executives and bring tremendous leadership skills to their new posts. They have been key members of our leadership team for many years and will continue to be in the years ahead. My congratulations to both of them. My last organizational update is a particularly important one to me. Although we will take the next two years to implement and appropriately celebrate the leadership of Bill Marriott, we wanted to share with you that Mr. Marriott has informed our Board of Directors that he plans to transition to the role of Chair Emeritus in 2022. Bill has been fully engaged in Marriott\u2019s work for as long as I have been alive. And he remains a daily source of contact and inspiration to me. In the midst of COVID-19, I talk to him every day. While our conversations today are focused on the crisis we are fighting, they are of a piece with the ongoing conversations that we have had day in and day out, ever since the summer of 1992 when we first met at the tail end of another crisis, the first Gulf War and the recession that followed. To state the obvious, we will celebrate Bill Marriott for his contributions to this company, to its associates and to the industry between now and his transition to Chair Emeritus in two years. For now, Bill, let me say thank you. To me, you are a boss, a mentor, a friend and truly, family. I cannot imagine a time without your partnership and friendship, and I pray that there are many more years ahead for us. In anticipation of Bill\u2019s transition to the Chair Emeritus role, we expect that David Marriott will join our Board of Directors next year. David is well suited to serve on our board, and I know he will bring not only his operations and sales experience, but also his deep understanding of Marriott\u2019s culture to board level conversations and decision-making. One other quick point and I know we are giving you a peek into our forward-looking plans. When David joins the Marriott board, we expect that he would step down at that time as an executive of Marriott. I look forward to working with David as a Director, and then Chair for many years to come. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny for more details on our finances. Leeny?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Thank you, Arne. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I also want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. Worldwide RevPAR was down 22.5% for the quarter, driven by the sharp 60% global decline in March. First quarter gross fee revenues totaled $629 million comprised of $214 million of base management fees and $415 million of franchise fees. Under the terms of our contracts, our portfolio of managed hotels earned $64 million of incentive management fees or IMFs in the first quarter. However, under accounting rules we can only recognize IMFs to the extent that the full-year forecast supports that these fees will not be reversed later in the year. At this point, there is significant uncertainty around full year performance, so we did not recognize any IMFs in the quarter. Within franchise fees, other non-RevPAR related fees totalled approximately $140 million, up 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by stable year-over-year credit card and time share branding fees as well as higher year-over-year residential branding fees. Adjusted EBITDA of $442 million included $79 million of bad debt expense and guarantee reserves related to COVID-19. Given the uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a recovery, we\u2019re unable to provide our normal quarterly and full year P&L guidance. Instead, I thought it would be helpful to talk through a modelling scenario for our monthly run-rate of major sources and uses of cash in the current environment with worldwide RevPAR down roughly 90% and also provide you with a few modelling sensitivities. Note that this is just one scenario and not an estimate of actual results. Marriott\u2019s overall cash flow is easiest to describe in two broad categories. The first category is classic cash flow at the corporate level, which is basically EBITDA less cash interest expense, cash taxes and investment spending. The second category relates to our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, which represent the costs that we charge out to our owners and franchisees to cover the programs and services we provide to them. Starting with corporate cash, at these extraordinarily low levels of RevPAR, we assume net cash outflows of roughly $90 million to $95 million per month. That\u2019s assuming cash sources of around $60 million to $65 million, and cash uses of about $155 million per month. The cash inflows are base management and franchise fees and other non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Given we are not currently recognizing any incentive fees due to the uncertainties around full year results, it\u2019s easiest to model RevPAR related base management and franchise fees based on 2019 actuals. If you adjust those for unit growth and the 90% decline in RevPAR, the result is roughly $20 million to $25 million of fees a month per point of RevPAR. Also, as a sensitivity for you, the impact of a 1 point change in RevPAR would be roughly $2 million of fees per month. As RevPAR climbs back closer to prior year levels, obviously the improvement in fees per point of RevPAR grows significantly. In this scenario, the remaining $40 million per month of fees is expected to come primarily from other non-RevPAR related franchise fees, mainly credit card branding fees, residential branding fees and timeshare royalty fees, all of which are much more stable. Assuming RevPAR is down 90%, we expect that corporate cash outflows could total approximately $155 million per month. Compared to our 2020 budget, we\u2019ve reduced our cash run-rate for corporate G&A by 30% excluding bad debt to about $40 million per month. And we\u2019ve eliminated or deferred around 45% of our original investment spending forecast of $700 million to $800 million for the full year, bringing our investment spending to roughly $35 million per month. The remaining $80 million per month includes cash interest expense, cash tax payments and the monthly cash outflows for our owned/leased hotel portfolio in this exceedingly low RevPAR environment. The second category of cash flows relates to the revenues and expenses for the programs and services that we provide to our hotels, for which we\u2019re entitled to reimbursement. As you know, our spend in reimbursement for hotel level programs and services are meant to net to zero over time, yet there can be timing differences between dollars we spend and dollars we collect. I\u2019ll break this second category of cash flows into two buckets. The first is the cash flow related to the Marriott Bonvoy program and the second is the timing of all our other programs and services. Cash flows into the loyalty program from hotels and our co-brand credit card issuers as members earn points. The cash outflows for Bonvoy are the payments made to hotels when members redeem points as well as the costs of running the program including marketing. This year, we expect to have much lower redemption expenses in terms of both volume of nights and the rate paid for those stays, given lower occupancies. At the current low occupancy rates, we estimate that we will generate several hundred million dollars of cash from the loyalty program this year or $45 million of cash benefit a month. This does not include the cash we recently received from our co-brand credit card issuers. That leaves the remainder of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses. A largest bucket is the direct pass-through of payroll and other operational costs at our hotels, primarily for our North American managed hotels. In 2019, these costs were around 75% of the more than $16 billion of GAAP reimbursed expenses. So far this year, we have reduced these pass-through costs by around two-thirds. These expenses are generally repaid to us within days, and in 2019, managed owners reimbursed us with very little exception or delay. At this point, a very small fraction of these managed hotels are delayed in paying us. Apart from these hotel level costs and loyalties, the remaining reimbursed expenses in 2019 supported mandatory programs and services we provide to our hotels. They cover brand sales and marketing funds, our reservation system, property management systems and the like. About two-thirds of the amounts charged to hotels to cover these costs, which are also included in cost reimbursement revenues, vary based on hotel level revenues or program usage with the remaining being a fixed charge per hotel or per key. That lines up well with our cost to provide these services, which are also about two-thirds variable and one-third fixed. With the significant cost cuts and changes we\u2019ve implemented in this low RevPAR environment, we believe that the cost reimbursement revenues due would cover our reimbursed expenses. But there could be some cash timing mismatch given the systems fee discount and payment deferral we provided for April and May as well as owners and franchisees extending their payables a bit. In this very low demand scenario, we could see roughly $100 million a month of higher working capital usage before considering the loyalty cash inflows. The net cash outflow for all programs and services including the positive cash flow from loyalty could be around $55 million a month, which brings the total company cash use to roughly $145 million to $150 million a month. It\u2019s worth noting that in April, despite the 90% decline in RevPAR, the company\u2019s cash burn rate was significantly better than that estimate. And of course, as trends improve, the cash burn rate should improve as well. I want to remind you that when you look on the P&L for cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses, it will look a bit different than the cash flows I\u2019ve just described, primarily due to the accounting for the loyalty program which requires that, as cash is received, it goes on to our balance sheet as deferred revenue with no immediate impact on the P&L. We\u2019ve been focused on preserving liquidity and shoring up our cash position. In mid-April, we issued $1.6 billion of five-year senior notes, and last week, we raised another $920 million through amendments to our co-brand credit card deals. We also eliminated dividends and share repurchases until further notice. Our current cash and cash equivalent amount on hand is around $3.9 billion. If you add to that cash, the undrawn capacity on our revolver of $1.3 billion, which we paid back on May 1, and deduct around $900 million of commercial paper currently outstanding, our net liquidity today is roughly $4.3 billion. We know the recovery could take a while, but we\u2019re confident we have the liquidity we need to manage through this situation, including paying back near-term debt maturities. We\u2019ve made solid progress in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and are prepared for the wide range of scenarios that could play out. We feel confident that we will come through this successfully and look forward to traveling and welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning, and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nArne Sorenson: Hey, Shaun.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Good morning, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning. I was trying to type about as fast as I\u2019ve ever typed to get through this section you just gave. So thank you for all the detail and hope everyone is doing well. Leeny, maybe to start with a high level one to just digest everything you kind of gave us, and do really appreciate that, could you give us a sense on maybe just the broader franchise and management system at this point? What have been some of the asks by the owner community at this point as we think through what their own kind of cash level needs may be? And specifically, if you could give any color on the percentage or number of either managed or franchise hotels that are sort of asking for either fee deferrals or fee relief at this stage?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: So, a couple things. First, I\u2019ll remind everybody once again that a huge proportion of our fees that we charge are revenue-based, so there is an automatic decline that has happened as a result of the drop in RevPAR. So that if you think about it for the mandatory programs and services that we charge, when you also include the deferral and the 50% discount that we gave in April and May, there\u2019s actually very little due at the moment from \u2013 on the mandatory programs and services. At the managed hotels in North America, we have also, as I talked about, dropped payroll incredibly, as well as all the operating costs at the hotels. So of course, you do have owners, just as we too are thinking about how we are managing our payables, everybody\u2019s trying to manage their cash as best they can. But I will say, our owners and franchisees are paying their bills. We have a really very, very small fraction of our hotels that are having trouble paying at the moment, and then except for a bit of extended payable terms that you can see, otherwise, it\u2019s really all systems go for the moment. And as I said in April, we actually saw, relative to those numbers I gave, really a fairly dramatically better situation than the one that I gave you, but we wanted you to have the benefit of our cash planning so that we are making sure that, no matter the situation, that we\u2019re able to manage through it.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff of JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Good to hear everybody and hope all of you are \u2013 and your families are healthy and well.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: You too, Joe.\nJoseph Greff: Thanks. Just with respect to your hotel owners, do you have a sense in North America how many of them accessed federal loans relief program? And then my second question is, can you estimate what you think maybe breakeven occupancies are for your North American full service, North American select service hotels? And I guess in that breakeven occupancy threshold, what ADRs are you assuming there? Thank you, both.\nArne Sorenson: So, there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the details of our owners\u2019 access of the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program] and other government support. Obviously, we\u2019re in touch with them and we hear back. We think that there are hundreds of hotels that have successfully applied for the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program]. How many of them have actually received the dollars is a little harder for us to keep track of. And the percentages that have been approved are in the 50% to 60% range, if you include the select service hotels. Select service hotels obviously tend to be more clearly small business than full service hotels, but for each hotel owner, there tends generally to be eligibility under some of these programs to get the kind of support that the government is intended to apply. We continue to work with them to try and navigate through that. I think the other thing that\u2019s important is what we hear anecdotally from our owners in North America is that lenders have been reasonably accommodating as well. And so you put those things together and then you put the collaboration that Leeny has just described between Marriott and our owners, which includes very much our cutting above property costs including costs of programs that are paid for by the system and then work at deferring brand standards and initiatives and working to tap \u2013 defer FF&E spending and to tap FF&E dollars and those sorts of things. And generally, we think the \u2013 well, there\u2019s pressure all around. We think overwhelmingly that the system is surviving so far. Obviously, it will get tougher the longer it lasts. But we do think we\u2019re at bottom and think we\u2019re likely to see some release in pressure as we go forward, as demand incrementally begins to return. The breakeven occupancy question is an interesting one. In a way, you could look at our portfolio in the United States \u2013 and, remember, April RevPAR down roughly 90% \u2013 and say why are only 16% of the hotels closed, because it\u2019s got to \u2013 at those sorts of numbers, there are many more hotels that are losing dollars than that are closed. And that\u2019s true. But the question is, do they lose \u2013 the question is not so much do they make money by staying open, but the question at the moment is do they lose less by staying open. And our general calculation is that by the time you get to 10% occupancy or so, you\u2019re probably better off from a purely financial perspective to stay open, that the losses will be lower than the losses associated with being closed. And remember, when you\u2019re closed, you\u2019ve still got labor costs for some labor that is required. You\u2019ve still got heating and cooling. You\u2019ve got security. You\u2019ve got other costs that cannot be avoided. And so it doesn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s not a closing scenario that gets you instantly to a breakeven level. You\u2019re still losing money on that. I think when you look at what is a cash breakeven, obviously it\u2019s going to depend a little bit on select service versus full service and the level of services provided. The level of services provided in hotels with light occupancy today is less than the level of services that were provided before COVID-19 showed up. Think about food and beverage as an example which is likely to be the significantly truncated today compared to what it was just a few months ago. But broadly, you\u2019re going to probably break even at 30% or so occupancy in the select brands and maybe 40% occupancy in the full service brands. But again, still do better by being open at occupancy levels which are lower than that than you would do by being closed. The last point I think I\u2019d make on this is, not just in terms of RevPAR but in terms of hotel closings/openings, April seems to have defined the bottom, and when we look at the last couple of weeks, there have not been significant movements in the number of closed hotels but most days we\u2019re seeing one or two or three more hotels reopen than we are seeing hotels closed. And if anything, as we see demand start to crawl back as restrictions are released, I think the trend line now is towards more openings, not towards more closings.\nJoseph Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes of SunTrust.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning. Wondering if you could give us some thoughts...\nArne Sorenson: Hey, Patrick.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning. Some thoughts about potential recovery. Do you see at this point groups returning in the back half of the year? Your thoughts on corporate fly-to demand? And then any early indications of summer leisure? I know it\u2019s sort of tough to figure out but just interested in your thoughts.\nArne Sorenson: Well, I think what we\u2019ve got to say here is probably not incrementally all that new from what others in the industry have been saying the last few weeks and what we\u2019ve been saying actually the last few weeks. It\u2019s \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve got a global phenomenon underway that is sort of stunning in its breadth. We\u2019ve talked about China a little bit, and China does appear to be recovering and holding. I know there\u2019s lots of debate about whether or not there is a resurgence of the virus in China. We\u2019ve got tens of thousands of associates working in our hotels and basically have a way of tapping into that community and listening to both their sentiment and to some extent the data. And by and large what we hear there is reassuring that in fact demand is coming back and the virus spread does not appear to be profound. That doesn\u2019t tell us for certain where it\u2019s going in the next few months, but there is something that\u2019s encouraging there. When you go around the world, you\u2019re going to see a different dynamic in various parts of the world. I think in Europe, Europe, unlike China and the United States, is meaningfully more dependent on long-haul travel. You think about Europe as being a destination for vacationers from all around the world who want to see those great European cities, and because it\u2019s dependent on air and long-haul, I suspect it will be probably the slowest to get back to the kind of levels that we enjoyed before COVID-19. Advantages of China and the United States are they\u2019re both domestic markets. Even in normal times, the US is about 95% to 96% US travel with only 4% to 5% in total dependent on in-bound travel from the rest of the world. And by the way Mexico and Canada are both big source markets, and they\u2019re obviously fairly close. Sometimes those are drive-to inbound business. Sometimes they\u2019re flight, obviously. Looking at the US, which maybe where your question is focused, we obviously see the drive-to markets as being the strongest. You can see that in even the data we showed on select brands in the prepared comments are performing better. And I think that\u2019s both leisure and to some extent it is sort of local or regional business, but business that is dependent on the car. And I think that will come back the most. I think we\u2019ll see some cities perform better, so a couple of contrasts here. New York may be the stickiest because of its density and its reliance on mass transportation which creates some sense of risk. And so we would suspect \u2013 and also maybe a little bit their dependence on international travel which is higher than the US as a whole. But go to a market like San Antonio or even Chicago, where there is a much more likelihood that people can drive in, in the summertime, be outside, enjoy Lake Michigan or enjoy the outdoor destinations and I think we will see those markets perform better and faster. The slowest bit of business to come back will certainly be group, and we hear from our group customers that they want to get back to a place where they can bring people together, but they obviously want to do that in a way which is safe. And that depends on some things which we can influence like the protocols we use around cleanliness and meetings in the hotels, and we\u2019ve got great work underway there. On the meeting side, it will include probably lower density in our hotels, in other words, more square footage being used for per head at a meeting than would have been the case beforehand. Maybe sadly, we\u2019ve got the capacity to do that, but there are parts of this which we won\u2019t be able to control to, and to the extent those meetings are dependent on air travel, it\u2019s not just going to be how does the plane itself feel and the airlines I think are making good progress there, but how is it getting through the airports and can you get through the security lines in a way that makes sense. I think on balance \u2013 you\u2019ve heard this a little bit from the industry data which is out there. I think what we\u2019re seeing across the United States is folks are tiptoeing out of their homes a bit more the last few weeks. We\u2019re probably seeing occupancy click up a point a week or something like that the last few weeks. That\u2019s not enough to put a stake in the ground and declare that we\u2019ve got momentum towards a recovery, given how low the numbers actually are. But it does tell you that the early travellers, which are going to be drive-to leisure, local, domestic, are interested in sort of getting out there and reliving their lives. And if they can do that and over time build confidence, collectively, we can build confidence in the safety that we can enjoy if we\u2019re out of our homes, that will get better and better. And if, on the other hand, restrictions are released and the virus spread surges and we can\u2019t have that confidence as consumers, it will not be just a question of what the government restrictions are, but it will be a question of what that confidence level is and that will make the recovery slower.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the very detailed answer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Hi. Good morning. I hope everyone\u2019s well. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about net unit growth? Thanks.\nArne Sorenson: Well, we\u2019re watching it, I think, is the right answer. Obviously, we\u2019re a month and a half into the extraordinary crisis outside of China and a couple of months longer than that in China. In various parts of the world, construction was essentially banned. In some markets, it was an essential service that was allowed to continue. Beyond that, you\u2019ve got some question about hotels that were ready to open and whether or not the final furniture supply was in-hand or not or whether it was dependent on the global supply chain, which itself slowed down. I think we can say with a relatively high level of confidence that the overwhelming majority of hotels, which were scheduled to open in 2020 would have been very far along in their construction and they will still make sense to reopen, assuming some kind of reasonable assumptions around recovery. And so while there will be delay in getting them opened, we would expect that they will open. Whether that delay is a number of months or a number of quarters probably will depend a little bit on those supply chain dynamics, construction restrictions which by and large have been released. I mean I think California banned construction for a period of time, and I think construction is now back on in California. And just the owners\u2019 sense about \u2013 obviously there\u2019s less urgency to get open but whether it\u2019s more logical to be open or to defer opening. It is likely we will have fewer new hotel openings than we assumed before COVID-19 in 2020. Whether that\u2019s down by half or down by a quarter, we\u2019ll have to watch and see. I think it\u2019s still way too early to identify. I do think that most of the hotels that were scheduled to open in 2020 will ultimately open into our system, and the same I think can be said for certainly most of the first half of 2021 openings as well.\nThomas Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thank you.\nArne Sorenson: Hi, Smedes.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. I wanted to ask you guys and others have made pronouncements around what cleaning will look like in hotels in kind of a post-COVID world as you reopen. Just how do you think about just the overall labor cost at a hotel going forward? Do you think they\u2019ll ultimately stay about the same? Or do you see significant increases or decreases from here?\nArne Sorenson: Well, it\u2019s going to be very interesting I think to watch. I think in the early stages, obviously, we\u2019re going to have less F&B service, for example. I think we\u2019re likely to have either fewer restaurants open, fewer meetings and the staffing that\u2019s associated with meetings, probably a difference in the approach to buffets and some of those sorts of things. So I suspect in the early quarters, it\u2019s going to be more grab and go and pre-packaged material, vary a little bit obviously by segment and by market around the world. But I think those things would generally tell you that for the balance of 2020, labor costs as a percentage of revenues are probably likely to be lower. I think when you look longer term, it\u2019s going to be interesting. Certainly, in the first stage, we would expect that digital check-in, think about using your phone as a key or checking in at a kiosk, will be important both to protect associates and to protect guests. I think there will be relatively greater effort in housekeeping between guests than there was before to make sure that those rooms are virus-free to the extent we can be certain of that. I suspect there could be relatively less services provided during the stay, however, and those things may offset each other a little bit. But obviously, we\u2019ll work our way through that in the best case we can. Long-winded way of saying I think in the near term certainly labor costs will be less, and obviously, we\u2019ll be looking longer term at making sure that we meet what our guests\u2019 expectations are and that the services provided are the services that are needed by our guests and also making sure that our owners get back to a place where their investments make sense and where their financial well-being is good for the long term.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. Could I just ask you one more too? Do you think \u2013 I guess particularly in North America, as maybe some owners struggle to get reopened or maybe have difficulty working with their banks, I mean, does Marriott \u2013 would you see more of a lending capacity or potentially putting out guarantees for debt to some of the owners maybe on a short-term basis? Or is that sort of not on the table right now?\nArne Sorenson: Leeny, you got that?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Yeah, I do. Yeah, I think as you know, we typically really use our capital to propel our growth. Now, we do obviously from time to time work with an owner in a specific situation, particularly when there\u2019s reinvestment going into a property as we have done with Host, for example. But I think, broadly speaking, we have reimbursables. We expect to get paid. We provide those programs and services, and the owners have an obligation to pay us. So while there is an ongoing dialogue and we certainly, as you\u2019ve seen from all of our efforts to reduce our costs as well as to defer the payment of some mandatory required fees, then wanting to be understanding about the situation. But at the same time, I would not expect to see that we would be doing extensive either guarantees or loans to deal with this.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis of Instinet.\nHarry Curtis: Hi. Leeny, just a quick follow-up on that question. As you think about your development going forward, does this crisis really change the way that you approach key money and mezz loans, given the reserves that you\u2019ve \u2013 not the reserve, but the impairment charge that you took today?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: So first of all, on the impairment charge, if you think about the biggest chunks of the impairment charge today, two of them were related to leases. They are leases that have been around, and as you know with the lease accounting change, we have these assets on our books called right of use assets that extend over the life of the lease. So frankly, they really don\u2019t relate to the classic sort of giving of key money with that. And frankly, there was one impairment charge that we took this quarter that we mentioned, the $14 million, that\u2019s on a very large portfolio of limited service hotels. And as part of that transaction, there was an agreement by the owner to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvent those properties. So quite frankly, still a transaction that was in the broader scheme of keeping up our portfolio and making them competitive, make a ton of sense. Now, I think, in general, as you think about what we have to invest in our pipeline, it\u2019s actually fairly small. It tends to be that on the more complex higher-end projects that we at the margin are going to have a little bit more capital in than if it\u2019s on a kind of small price-limited service hotel. But I think fundamentally, we still view that the way that we approach investing in deals to be appropriate. Now, at the same time, I will say we are obviously cognizant of kind of where we are from a liquidity standpoint as well as rebuilding the business over the next few years. So when we think about, for example, our restrictions that we have put into our revolver covenant waiver, we\u2019re obviously going to keep very closely, a very close watch on the amounts of investment that we\u2019re spending. But I think from a fundamental approach, we still feel really good about the value that we are driving with these key money type of investment.\nHarry Curtis: And thank you. Arne, maybe you can respond to the second question, which is, as you imagine the recovery two to three years from now, and the house process margin that was generated across your portfolio in 2019, you\u2019ve walked through some of the gives and takes on higher and lower expenses. Is it unrealistic to think that you can get there in the next two or three years, assuming the same level of occupancy?\nArne Sorenson: Get back to the same level of profit per room, you\u2019re talking about?\nHarry Curtis:  Exactly.\nArne Sorenson: Yeah, yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s certainly really not unrealistic to try, and I think we will work hard at that, if not getting back to the same levels, getting to even better levels. I do think that the \u2013 in the first instance, the recovery, top line recovery obviously is really important to this as well as what we do on the cost side. Top line recovery in the first instance is going to be COVID-19 driven. What is the sense of government restriction that gets in the way of our business? And what is the sense of sort of remaining concern or anxiety about the spread of the virus that dampens down demand? And the recovery from that is going to depend significantly on the progress of the virus, the development of a vaccine, the development of other treatments, maybe ubiquity of testing, all the things that are being talked about every day and endlessly every day. I think beyond that, that the question about the top line is going to be driven by the economy. And none of us knows how severe the economic hangover will be when the fear of COVID-19 recedes. But there is every reason to suspect that there may be some stickiness to a weaker demand environment, at least for a period of time, simply because of GDP activity. And so, those things I think are both important from a top line perspective. From a cost perspective, we will obviously do the kinds of things that we\u2019re going to do. To the extent the top line is depriving us of dollars per room of revenue, that challenge becomes a little bit more significant. But I think as we move our way down the recovery and we see revenue per room come back, we ought to have a fighting chance at getting profits per room back too.\nHarry Curtis: Thanks, everybody. And Leeny, if you could send us the spreadsheet of your presentation, that would save us a lot of work.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell of Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Hello. Good morning, everyone.\nArne Sorenson: Good morning.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Powell: Good morning. Question on, I guess, supply growth. So do you expect this event to have an impact on how vendors approach construction financing? Do you expect them to maybe require more equities and require more cash reserves? And could that be kind of a long-term headwinds to new construction over time?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Well, I\u2019ll start. And then, Arne, feel free to add on. So I think first of all, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s already under construction. The financial institutions today are in vastly better health than they were back in the Great Recession. And as Arne was saying earlier, these deals still make sense. They\u2019re under construction. There\u2019s no reason to think that they won\u2019t get finished as the final supplies are delivered and they have the ability to open. Now, could it be that they open a bit later, depending on the environment for demand? Sure. But again, from everything we hear anecdotally as well as see \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you notice around your towns that construction actually is one of the few businesses that you can actually still see a fair amount going on. And so, as you then think about the pipeline of new deals, I think that clearly is one that there\u2019s more question around and that there is likely to be at least a bit more of a wait-and-see attitude by the lenders on committing to new deals. However, the one thing I will say is that as you think about, if they are going to lend, who are they going to lend to, it\u2019s kind of classically been the case that the stronger brands get the financing when deals are getting done. And I would expect with all that you\u2019ve heard around what we\u2019re doing related to cleanliness and making sure that the guests know the standards that they can expect our hotels to have when they come, that will continue to be one of the strong points that our brands have when a developer goes to consider getting a loan. And the other thing I\u2019ll say that the conversations that our developers are having continue apace. Obviously, conversion activity is up right now as we think about those conversations as well as then continued on new construction. These are folks who are looking for the longer term, and from a longer term perspective, they still view it quite strongly.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And you mentioned, Arne, that you saw some good RevPAR index gains in January and February. How do you maintain that momentum in this kind of environment? Is that something you can even focus on? And looking maybe to early next year in a downturn scenario, what tools do you have to continue to grow RevPAR index?\nArne Sorenson: Well, we call that Marriott Bonvoy. I think as of the end of the quarter, we\u2019re at 142,000 members or something like that. And I think the program remains a powerful tool for us to drive loyalty of travelers to our brands. And we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on making sure that program is strong and is relevant to folks, both as they travel and when they\u2019re not traveling, and I think that will be the principal tool in our toolkit. Beyond that, of course, it\u2019s the questions that are sometimes related, sometimes mutually reinforcing of that but it is the breadth of distribution. It is hotels that continue to inspire people when they dream about travel, which is often about resort destinations and about luxury and lifestyle hotels, not exclusively, but that certainly is a piece of that. And I think our portfolio there is extraordinarily strong. And then questions about how do we go to market with the sales force and how do we make sure we\u2019re delivering the kinds of operational excellence which Marriott has long been known for. I think all of those things will remain tools that we rely on. We\u2019re disappointed obviously by COVID-19 for so many reasons, but partly the momentum that we had built in the latter part of 2019 and which continued into 2020 with, as we mentioned, 330 basis points of index growth in January and February, which are massive numbers for a portfolio of our size, speak very well for our ability to get back there and rebuild that momentum. There\u2019s nothing about COVID-19 which should disrupt that momentum in the years ahead.\nAnthony Powell: Thank you.\nArne Sorenson: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley of UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on what you mentioned earlier about unit growth and I understand the new construction uncertainty of kind of how much of that will get delayed, but I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about conversions and what level of interest you may be seeing, especially given that some owners out there not in your system are probably under some pressure. And how much could conversions offset some of the slower growth in new units? And how quickly could they get into your pipeline? And then just as a point of comparison on the same topic, if you could tell us a little bit more about how in the last downturn that may have \u2013 it seems like conversions obviously uptick in a downturn. And how much did that offset changes in maybe what your \u2013 the decline in new unit growth? Thanks.\nArne Sorenson: So, Leeny, you may have this data top of mind. I\u2019m not sure I do. But if you look through cycles, and this would be directional, not probably as concrete as you\u2019d like, Robin, in a weaker environment, conversions go up. They go up for us. They go up for the stronger brands, because not every hotel can perform as well in a weaker environment. And so, we\u2019re already seeing conversations pop up where folks are looking at oh, my goodness, how do I get this hotel reopened, and don\u2019t I need a pipeline of customers in a loyalty program today more than I needed six months ago or three months ago. And so, all of that will help. I think at the same time, it\u2019s fair to say that while conversions step up in a weaker environment, new builds step down and they probably step down at least as much as the conversions step up. And so, we would, if you look at 2010, 2011, 2012, the hotels that were under construction before the Great Recession continued to open into our system. But we had not signed hotels, new hotels in 2009 and 2010 at the kind of pace that we had before the Great Recession hit. And so we end up with a percentage unit growth even with the benefit of conversions which is certainly not higher than what we would have had before and, if my recollection serves, would, on average, have been a little bit lower. I think when we look now into the next period of time, I think our brands are stronger, I think the portfolio is stronger, I think the momentum with the loyalty program and our index numbers are stronger. All of which will bode well for conversion activity as by the way is the depth of the decline in performance of the industry as a whole, which gives then much more motivation I think for owners to move. At the same time, as Leeny has just gone through, I think we\u2019re going to see that while the banks are much stronger than they\u2019ve been in the prior crises, they will inevitably pause and either require more equity or get to see whether or not we can get more clarity before they\u2019re going to provide the kind of financing commitments that they were providing before COVID-19 hit. Put all those things together, I suspect we\u2019ll find opportunities here. But we will be less likely to be seeing an increase near term in net rooms openings into our system than a decrease. Leeny, do you disagree?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: No, I totally agree. The only thing I\u2019ll add, Robin, is one of the differences between now and the Great Recession is our strong portfolio of soft brands, and frankly, the interest that we\u2019re seeing in those brands around the world. So the conversion vehicles that we have now as compared to 12 years ago, I do think are meaningfully stronger, which I think is helpful. I think the financing realities are going to stay the same, so that\u2019s kind of we\u2019re going to have to \u2013 if somebody\u2019s looking for financing or refinancing to do a deal, we\u2019ll have to work through that in the demand environment with COVID. But I do think that we\u2019ve got the right portfolio of brands, kind of across all 30. And we definitely are seeing increasing conversations. But as Arne said, if you\u2019re looking at kind of normally maybe 15% to 20% of your room openings are conversion and let\u2019s say that number goes up to a third, that still is not going to offset what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the slowdown in new construction.\nRobin Farley: Great. That makes sense. Thank you. And maybe one small follow-up. And just if you think about sort of last year or something typical, what percent of your conversions were from the soft brands, which like you said, something you didn\u2019t have in the last downturn? Thanks.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: In North America, it\u2019s going to be overwhelmingly that way. So if you think about in full service, the full service rooms that we opened may be about call it 25%, 20% of our room openings in North America, because limited service is such a big chunk in our current pipeline, not of the existing stock but of the room openings, they\u2019re going to overwhelmingly be soft brand, either new build or conversions. So I\u2019d say we can get you the specific numbers, but a good percentage.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz of Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nArne Sorenson: Good morning.\nDavid Katz: Good to hear everyone\u2019s voices, and thank you for all the detail and transparency as usual. I just wanted to pose a strategic issue. When you sort of think about growing your business going forward and in the context of this event and other events we\u2019ve been through, how do you think about the hurdle rates of taking on a hotel as a management contract versus a franchise with a third-party operator and sort of calibrating all of the risks and returns associated with all that, given where we are? And this may be a larger question for another day, but I thought I\u2019d pose it anyway.\nArne Sorenson: Yeah, it\u2019s a fair question and obviously one that has been raised a few times. I think there are obvious differences between management and franchise. The franchise model is dramatically more prevalent in the lower segments of the industry. Franchising is also dramatically more prevalent in the US than it is in other markets around the world. And there are obviously different reasons for those distinctions. One is that the farther up the chain scale you go, the more likely you\u2019re getting into group, the more likely you\u2019re getting into luxury, the greater premium is placed on operational expertise. And by no means do I mean to suggest that there aren\u2019t franchisees that have expertise that is able to do that. But not all franchisees do and in some markets of the world, those franchisees by and large have not existed yet. I think that there is room for us to consider whether in some of the lower segments we have more management than we need to have, whether we\u2019ve had sort of a cultural bias towards management that is unnecessary. At the same time, I think the power of the luxury brands, the power of the lifestyle brands, the power in the group space, the power in food and beverage, I for one wouldn\u2019t trade that away. I think that is something that is going to drive the stickiness of the loyalty program, drive aspirational travel, drive higher-end travel which will continue to be strong. And we want very much to keep that as a prominent and industry-leading part of our portfolio and would not trade Marriott\u2019s model for being purely in the lower segments. There might be a different risk profile there, but there\u2019s also a different upside this year.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets.\nWes Golladay: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you talk about what drove the $65 million of bad debt expense this quarter?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Yeah, sure. As you know, the new accounting standard called CECL, better known as CECL, does it a little bit differently than the way that bad debt was done for us before, and it\u2019s an accounting standard that everybody out there has got to follow. And before, for us, it was truly writing them off once it was very clear that the receivable was absolutely uncollectible. The requirement now is a little bit more as you think about like a classic loan portfolio for a bank, where it has to have obviously what you reflect as uncollectible, but also an estimate of future expected losses. So it requires that you go when you\u2019re looking at your past history of your receivables and making an estimate based on performance of where they will prove out, and so you actually are taking a classic loan loss provision against that base of receivables as well as when you\u2019ve actually got a specific receivable that\u2019s deemed uncollectable. So as you can see in the number that we talked about, $65 million, as part of what was in G&A this quarter, that obviously is meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. So it\u2019s got whatever ones that we very specifically deem uncollectible but also given the environment an estimate of future expected losses.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow of Raymond James.\nWilliam Crow: One for each of you. Leeny, is there any risk to collecting what is owed from the timeshare business?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: I\u2019m sure they\u2019re listening to this call, so I would say, no. No. I think that\u2019s, as you know, is overwhelmingly a fixed charge, and we feel great about our partner, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, and we do not believe that there is risk associated with that fee.\nWilliam Crow: Okay. And then, Arne, bigger picture, any change given the current dynamics to your investment, your commitment to Homes & Villas?\nArne Sorenson: Oh, no, I don\u2019t think so. The amount of money we\u2019ve invested in Homes & Villas is really very modest. You\u2019re talking about a handful of millions of dollars, something like that, to keep the business up and running. And I think the way we\u2019ve positioned that business, which is the higher end of the home-sharing space sort of skewing towards whole home and luxury which is quite different from traditional hotel product and has different dynamics I think too in a COVID-19 environment, because you\u2019re not really sharing a part of a home and you\u2019re ending up in a place which I think can be where we can deliver the kind of professional services that we like to deliver which suggests there\u2019s still opportunity for that. It is, as a consequence, I think something that we will continue to pay attention to.\nWilliam Crow: Do you think it will ramp back up similar to the way the hotels are ramping up?\nArne Sorenson: Yeah, I would think so. I mean, it\u2019s obviously a tiny business for us by comparison to what we\u2019re doing, and it is leisure focused, more leisure focused than our hotel business is. There could be some modest differences in the way that the ramp occurs. I wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re very dramatic though.\nWilliam Crow: Okay. Thank you.\nArne Sorenson: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Good morning, everyone.\nArne Sorenson: Hey, Michael.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Good morning.\nMichael Bellisario: Just one quick question for you. I think you mentioned payment deferrals and 50% fee discounts, but that was I think just for April and May. When do you decide or what gets you to offer the same concessions for, say, June and July, for example, or maybe even longer? What are you looking for? What do you have to see? What do you have to hear from franchisees?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Well, again, I think as I talked about before, we\u2019ve done a remarkable job of being able to reduce our costs down to this level where we were able to offer this and still feel like we\u2019ll be able to recoup our expenses in providing these kind of basic mandatory programs and services. So I don\u2019t expect at this point that we would be looking at offering a further discount.\nMichael Bellisario: And then what\u2019s the timing or your expected timing for recouping those fees?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Oh, sorry. Yes. September.\nMichael Bellisario: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just a quick one from me. Arne, Leeny, what percentage of your occupied room nights in 2019 were from guests originating from a flight?\nArne Sorenson: We\u2019ve asked that question too. You may have noticed that when you check into a hotel we actually don\u2019t typically ask people how they came. And so we\u2019ve looked at this a little bit based on other data sources. And it won\u2019t surprise you to learn that it varies dramatically from market to market. The select brands in the United States are going to be much less dependent on fly-to business than some markets where basically you can\u2019t get there unless you fly. Think about the Canary Islands as an example. Our estimate is it\u2019s probably half, something like that. But again, in a way you\u2019ve got to be careful about a global average because it hides dramatic variation within it.\nCarlo Santarelli: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, if I could, just one quick follow-up. With respect to the, I guess, it\u2019s $900 million of commercial paper outstanding right now, the next payments on that are due \u2013 any kind of sense of when that [indiscernible].\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Yeah. Mostly in the third quarter.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, both, very much.\nArne Sorenson: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research.\nJared Shojaian: Can you tell me what percentage of your pipeline is under contract or approved but has not yet begun construction? And, Arne, you mentioned you haven\u2019t really seen an unusual amount of deals drop from the pipeline. Are you surprised by that? And I guess a lot of the conversation today seems to be around financing availability going forward. But from an owner\u2019s perspective, the economics of building today are certainly very different. So I guess why wouldn\u2019t we see a lot of that particular segment of the pipeline go away, the segment that has not begun construction?\nArne Sorenson: [indiscernible] started construction. So I think the number we shared with you \u2013 and jump in here, team, if I\u2019m remembering this wrong \u2013 230,000 of the 516,000 are under construction.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: That\u2019s right.\nArne Sorenson: So that\u2019s like 40%, something like that. 45% maybe.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nArne Sorenson: In that range. And so that\u2019s the concrete number we can give you. I think what happens with this, the balance that are not under construction over the course of the next couple of years, there\u2019s a few things to bear in mind here. One is that hotels are not entering that pipeline until typically they have been worked for a substantial period of time. It could be a year on average, although I\u2019m guessing here a little bit where an owner is identifying a site, doing detailed work about how much it\u2019s going to cost to build it, doing pro formas about what the returns are going to be and it is not, even though it may not be under construction, it is something which is very serious. We\u2019re not putting deals in our pipeline, for example, just because somebody shows up and says I want to build a courtyard in X market, but I haven\u2019t identified the site yet or I don\u2019t have a specific deal to get done. And when viewed in that context, I don\u2019t think it is at all surprising that 60 days into a crisis like this one that has a fairly uncertain path out that people are being tentative about making permanent decisions about killing deals that they\u2019ve worked on for a period of time. I think the second thing to bear in mind is while we certainly have suffered a substantial hit in terms of top line performance, we will all be looking together to see what the best thinking can be about when that top line comes back. And for hotels that have not yet been built, what is the advantage that is available to me, if I can get it financed at a lower construction cost? And if I\u2019m not open and I\u2019m not going to be open for the two or three years that I need to be under construction, which may coincide with the weaker demand environment and also the weaker construction environment, my deal actually may be a decent deal and I may decide to pursue it. I probably won\u2019t accelerate my construction until I get smarter about thinking that through, but there will be upsides as well as downsides associated with this weakness for projects that are not yet under construction.\nJared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you. And just a point of clarification, if I may. You did give the number, 45% that\u2019s under construction. But is that other 55%, is some of that conversions? Or are you saying that all that 55% is [indiscernible]?\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Yeah. I can give you that. So roughly 16,000 are pending conversions, and then as we said in the press release, about 24,000 are approved, but not yet signed. All the rest are new build pending construction starts.\nJared Shojaian: Got it. Thank you very much.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Call it, roughly 240,000, broadly speaking.\nJared Shojaian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke of Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Hi. A couple of [indiscernible] again, I believe. The first one is just your view on rates. You\u2019ve talked about offering a 20% discount for prepaid vouchers. Your rate was down just 1% in the last quarter on the hotels where you control it. So just much are you willing to flex the rate to drive incremental demand?\nArne Sorenson: Well, I think we\u2019ll watch that obviously. We want to make sure that we\u2019re not dropping rate to chase demand, which is not there and that obviously does nothing for us. At the same time, we compete in an industry which is highly distributed in terms of its pricing. And this is one of the challenges that we bear perpetually. People view us as, okay, you\u2019re the largest hotel company in the world, doesn\u2019t that give you pricing power. Well, the fact of the matter is, even as the largest hotel company in the world, we\u2019ve only got \u2013 what\u2019s our global distribution, Leeny? 14%? 15%? Something like that of all rooms in the world? And a significant number...\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: 7% percent globally. 16%, North America, 16%. 3% outside of the world.\nArne Sorenson: And many of those rooms are priced by our franchisees, not priced by Marriott. And so we will \u2013 we\u2019re not going to push rates down by any means. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure we\u2019re maintaining pricing power, but there will be price competition in our industry too as we try and get demand energized and coming back into the system. And we\u2019ll do the best we can, making the kinds of judgments that need to be made.\nRichard Clarke: And just a quick follow-up, if I may. Just the comment on incentive fees, you booked none this quarter, despite receiving some. Just whether I can understand how \u2013 I wonder what process would you refund incentive fees you received, and what assumptions are you making to book now in the first quarter.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: So, as you know, you basically are looking every month at the expectation of the performance against a budget and against a target, depending on what the contract requires. So if there\u2019s an owner\u2019s priority then you need to have exceeded that but again, based on that month\u2019s performance expectation. The issue, however, becomes you don\u2019t actually technically earn it at the end of the year, until you see what the full year performance is. So based on, for example, January and February which were really terrific and really strong performance, we clearly were clicking along, doing well, and as I said, now would have locked in early on $64 million of incentive fees, however, even despite Greater China starting to really feel some impact in February and March. But when we look, knowing as we enter into April that you\u2019re looking at 90% decline in RevPAR, our comfort that we can feel secure, that we won\u2019t have to give those back is not great enough for us to feel like that we can recognize them as income.\nRichard Clarke: Very good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your final question will come from the line of Rich Hightower of Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question here.\nArne Sorenson: Hi, Rich.\nRich Hightower: Hope everybody\u2019s well. So can you just help us understand the implied cost of capital for the $900-odd-million of coming in incrementally from the credit card agreements? Just help \u2013 I know there\u2019s a lot of assumptions in there but just help us understand that as a source versus other sources of capital.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Sure. So let me do this, and then, Arne, obviously jump in. Think about it this way, that as people spend on their credit cards, our credit card issuers pay us an agreed amount of money, based on that credit card spend. And that is to compensate us for obviously being a part of the Bonvoy program and also for being able to affiliate with the Marriott brands. So when you think about that kind of amount over a number of years, there\u2019s kind of an expectation about how much you could be collecting in revenues from the credit card companies. And basically, it\u2019s getting some of it upfront. So what will happen over the next several years is what they will pay us based on the amount of credit card spend will be moderately a modest amount less than they otherwise would have paid us. So if you think about it from a kind of classic cost of capital, it\u2019s extremely efficient and economic for Marriott to have. It also doesn\u2019t have obviously any of the classic characteristics of debt in terms of required repayment terms, et cetera. So it\u2019s really, again, overwhelmingly a reflection of monies that we receive earlier that then will get essentially paid back by them paying us less than they otherwise would have over the next several years. .\nArne Sorenson: And the cost is less than our last bond deal.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Meaningfully.\nRich Hightower: Got it. Got it. Thank you, guys.\nArne Sorenson: You bet.\nArne Sorenson: Thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate obviously your interest in us and in the recovery of Marriott and the industry. Wishing nothing but the best as we work our way through this challenging time, as a business, as an industry and as society. But know that we\u2019ll be there to welcome you as soon as you get back on the road with bells on. Thank you.\nKathleen Kelly Oberg: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Arne Sorenson",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 conference call. I hope everyone and their families are safe and healthy during these unprecedented and challenging times. And I would like to send my deepest condolences to those of you who have lost friends or family because of COVID-19. Please know that our thoughts are with you. Joining me today from their respective homes are Leeny Oberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Burka McConagha, our Senior Vice President-Investor Relations; and Betsy Dahm, Vice President-Investor Relations. I believe this is the first time that Marriott team has not been together in the same room to host this call. And that includes an earnings call from China in 2018 and one during a blizzard in 2010. I want to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR and occupancy comments reflect system-wide constant currency and year-over-year changes, and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. Let me begin with what is clearly top of mind for all of you, how Marriott is navigating through the extraordinary and continually evolving worldwide impact of COVID-19. This is by far the most significant crisis ever to impact our business. We're a company that is 92 years old and has weathered the Great Depression, World War II, and numerous natural disasters around the world, that is saying something. Well, the year generally got off to a great start. We saw sudden sharp declines in occupancy associated with COVID-19, beginning in Greater China in January and then extending around the world. Occupancy continued to deteriorate in March and then stabilized in April, albeit at very low levels everywhere except for Greater China, where trends are improving. RevPAR in April fell 90% worldwide and in North America as well. April system-wide occupancy was 12% both worldwide and in North America. For the week ending May 2, worldwide occupancy was 15% and 20% when just looking at comparable hotels that were actually open. About 25% of our hotels worldwide are temporarily closed with 16% of our North American portfolio temporarily closed. Europe is mostly shut down with just over three-quarters of our hotels closed right now. To state the obvious, we are operating in a very challenging environment. However, the glimmer of good news is that overall negative trends appear to have bottomed in most regions around the world. The resiliency of demand is evident in the improving trends in Greater China. New bookings continue to pick up with demand driven primarily by domestic travelers. Occupancy levels in Greater China are currently just over 30%, up from the lows of under 10% in mid-February. RevPAR has followed a similar trajectory, currently down around 67% year-over-year compared to an 85% decline in February. Throughout Mainland China, leisure demand was strong for the Chinese Labor Day holiday weekend in early May. Occupancy for that weekend was over 45% with resort markets close to 70%. We have seen examples of demand starting to come back in other areas around the world as well. Last weekend, as some beaches reopened, the Ritz-Carlton Bacara in Santa Barbara and our hotels in Hilton Head, South Carolina, for example, were expected to reach approximately 50% occupancy based on reservations on the book. Limited service occupancy in the US has increased a bit each week over the past few weeks, showing the most meaningful improvements in drive-to destinations. Local, state and national governments are trying to manage the tight rope between containing COVID-19 and restarting their economies. There are likely to be some areas that start slower, some faster, and some that open in fits and starts. But our business should improve as restrictions are relaxed. On the development front, our pipeline increased slightly to a very healthy 516,000 rooms at the end of the first quarter. We opened over 14,000 rooms in the first quarter and at quarter end. Over 230,000 rooms in our pipeline or around 45% were under construction. We do expect some hotel openings will be delayed due to COVID-19 related supply chain issues or local restrictions on construction activity, but at this point, we have not seen more deals than usual dropping out of the pipeline. The pace of new deal signings overall has slowed a bit as a result of the crisis, but we are encouraged by our current conversations with owners. Many continue to have a clear preference for our portfolio of brands which posted worldwide RevPAR index gains of 330 basis points in the first two months of the year. Like us, many owners are taking a longer term view on the market opportunity. In the first quarter, our Asia Pacific region saw meaningful development activity with over 9,000 rooms signed, roughly 45% more than in the year-ago quarter. And we continue to see strong interest from owners in North America, even though they are not feeling a sense of urgency to get deals across the finish line. We cancelled our North America monthly development deal approval meeting in March for the first time in more than a decade, to pause and take stock of the environment, given the dramatic pace at which COVID-19 was impacting the industry, but have now returned to our usual meeting cadence. We continue to do what we can do across all areas of our business to respond to the current environment. We have issued several updates on the numerous actions we have taken which have focused on helping our associates, our guests, our hotel owners and franchisees and the company itself manage through this situation. While no one can know exactly when and how demand will start to return in each part of the world, Marriott is ready. We have swiftly made significant short-term changes to our business and enhanced our liquidity position, while remaining focused on how to best position ourselves for the recovery and for growth over the longer term. As global trends have started to stabilize, teams across the company have been diligently monitoring various data points and developing a cross-discipline recovery plan. In addition to tracking the booking and cancelation information and macroeconomic indicators, we are also looking at data around COVID-19 testing and cases and government regulations, all with an eye towards ramping up our business in a thoughtful way as restrictions are lifted and market conditions improve. We are consulting with our owners to analyze potential market demand and hotel-level cash flow to help inform when and how to reopen their hotels. Region-specific marketing strategies are being developed that we plan to roll out in phases as different customer segments and levels of demand return. A key component of our marketing plans will be leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and focusing on reaching our highly engaged member base and our many Marriott Bonvoy credit cardholders. Throughout this crisis, we have continued to communicate with our loyalty members, including with special promotions on our co-brand credit cards in the US, such as our offer for six times points on groceries. We have also extended elite benefits, and today, to help spark demand, we will announce a new promotion to buy gift cards for future hotel stays at a 20% discount. In Greater China, our joint venture with Alibaba has been very helpful in rebuilding demand. A recent spring sale run by Alibaba's Fliggy travel site was very successful and generated terrific near-term bookings. Bookings from Ctrip have also grown significantly over the past few weeks and are up over 15% for the first week of May versus the same time last year. Another key component of our recovery plan is communicating with our guests and associates about our focus on health and safety, and giving them the confidence they need to travel and stay with us. We recently announced enhanced global cleanliness guidelines, focused on elevating cleanliness levels and hospitality norms to meet the health and safety challenges presented by the new environment. We are also working to reduce the frequency of contact between associates and guests by continuing to roll out programs such as mobile check-in, mobile key and no-contact room service. I want to take moment to express my appreciation to our team of associates around the world. Amidst furloughs, reduced workweeks, temporary hotel closures, new cleaning requirements and very lean operation staffing, they continue to inspire me every day. Their constant messages to me of hope and belief in Marriott remind me over and over that we are so fortunate to have the best team in the business. The recovery is not going to happen uniformly across all regions and it is not going to occur overnight. It may take longer than any of us would like and we will likely operate a bit differently going forward, but we have taken the steps necessary to position the company to manage through this crisis successfully, and travel will rebound. Our people, our solid financial footing, our 30 industry-leading brands and our number one Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program continue to point toward a brighter future. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to share some organizational news. Dave Grissen, our current Head of the Americas, has decided to step down from his position as Group President of the Americas in the first quarter of 2021 after a 36-year career with Marriott. Dave and I started talking about his potential retirement last year, but neither he nor I felt the time was right to finalize any retirement. As we moved into 2020 and increasingly turned toward questions around how we will rebuild our business and our company on the other side of COVID-19, it became obvious that we needed our new leaders to be fully engaged in this process. Dave will be with us through Q1, allowing for a smooth and thoughtful transition, but he will be missed by all of us and we wish him all the best as he ventures into the next phase of his life. Dave, thank you for your extraordinary contributions to Marriott. Starting in 2021, we will remain organized in a continent structure, but our global lodging business will be consolidated under two fantastic veteran leaders: Liam Brown, the current Head of EMEA, will oversee North America; and Craig Smith, our current Head of Asia Pacific, will oversee all international regions outside of North America. Liam and Craig are excellent executives and bring tremendous leadership skills to their new posts. They have been key members of our leadership team for many years and will continue to be in the years ahead. My congratulations to both of them. My last organizational update is a particularly important one to me. Although we will take the next two years to implement and appropriately celebrate the leadership of Bill Marriott, we wanted to share with you that Mr. Marriott has informed our Board of Directors that he plans to transition to the role of Chair Emeritus in 2022. Bill has been fully engaged in Marriott's work for as long as I have been alive. And he remains a daily source of contact and inspiration to me. In the midst of COVID-19, I talk to him every day. While our conversations today are focused on the crisis we are fighting, they are of a piece with the ongoing conversations that we have had day in and day out, ever since the summer of 1992 when we first met at the tail end of another crisis, the first Gulf War and the recession that followed. To state the obvious, we will celebrate Bill Marriott for his contributions to this company, to its associates and to the industry between now and his transition to Chair Emeritus in two years. For now, Bill, let me say thank you. To me, you are a boss, a mentor, a friend and truly, family. I cannot imagine a time without your partnership and friendship, and I pray that there are many more years ahead for us. In anticipation of Bill's transition to the Chair Emeritus role, we expect that David Marriott will join our Board of Directors next year. David is well suited to serve on our board, and I know he will bring not only his operations and sales experience, but also his deep understanding of Marriott's culture to board level conversations and decision-making. One other quick point and I know we are giving you a peek into our forward-looking plans. When David joins the Marriott board, we expect that he would step down at that time as an executive of Marriott. I look forward to working with David as a Director, and then Chair for many years to come. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny for more details on our finances. Leeny? Hey, Shaun. So, there's a lot we don't know about the details of our owners' access of the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program] and other government support. Obviously, we're in touch with them and we hear back. We think that there are hundreds of hotels that have successfully applied for the Payroll Protection Program (sic) [Paycheck Protection Program]. How many of them have actually received the dollars is a little harder for us to keep track of. And the percentages that have been approved are in the 50% to 60% range, if you include the select service hotels. Select service hotels obviously tend to be more clearly small business than full service hotels, but for each hotel owner, there tends generally to be eligibility under some of these programs to get the kind of support that the government is intended to apply. We continue to work with them to try and navigate through that. I think the other thing that's important is what we hear anecdotally from our owners in North America is that lenders have been reasonably accommodating as well. And so you put those things together and then you put the collaboration that Leeny has just described between Marriott and our owners, which includes very much our cutting above property costs including costs of programs that are paid for by the system and then work at deferring brand standards and initiatives and working to tap \u2013 defer FF&E spending and to tap FF&E dollars and those sorts of things. And generally, we think the \u2013 well, there's pressure all around. We think overwhelmingly that the system is surviving so far. Obviously, it will get tougher the longer it lasts. But we do think we're at bottom and think we're likely to see some release in pressure as we go forward, as demand incrementally begins to return. The breakeven occupancy question is an interesting one. In a way, you could look at our portfolio in the United States \u2013 and, remember, April RevPAR down roughly 90% \u2013 and say why are only 16% of the hotels closed, because it's got to \u2013 at those sorts of numbers, there are many more hotels that are losing dollars than that are closed. And that's true. But the question is, do they lose \u2013 the question is not so much do they make money by staying open, but the question at the moment is do they lose less by staying open. And our general calculation is that by the time you get to 10% occupancy or so, you're probably better off from a purely financial perspective to stay open, that the losses will be lower than the losses associated with being closed. And remember, when you're closed, you've still got labor costs for some labor that is required. You've still got heating and cooling. You've got security. You've got other costs that cannot be avoided. And so it doesn't \u2013 there's not a closing scenario that gets you instantly to a breakeven level. You're still losing money on that. I think when you look at what is a cash breakeven, obviously it's going to depend a little bit on select service versus full service and the level of services provided. The level of services provided in hotels with light occupancy today is less than the level of services that were provided before COVID-19 showed up. Think about food and beverage as an example which is likely to be the significantly truncated today compared to what it was just a few months ago. But broadly, you're going to probably break even at 30% or so occupancy in the select brands and maybe 40% occupancy in the full service brands. But again, still do better by being open at occupancy levels which are lower than that than you would do by being closed. The last point I think I'd make on this is, not just in terms of RevPAR but in terms of hotel closings/openings, April seems to have defined the bottom, and when we look at the last couple of weeks, there have not been significant movements in the number of closed hotels but most days we're seeing one or two or three more hotels reopen than we are seeing hotels closed. And if anything, as we see demand start to crawl back as restrictions are released, I think the trend line now is towards more openings, not towards more closings. Hey, Patrick. Well, I think what we've got to say here is probably not incrementally all that new from what others in the industry have been saying the last few weeks and what we've been saying actually the last few weeks. It's \u2013 obviously, we've got a global phenomenon underway that is sort of stunning in its breadth. We've talked about China a little bit, and China does appear to be recovering and holding. I know there's lots of debate about whether or not there is a resurgence of the virus in China. We've got tens of thousands of associates working in our hotels and basically have a way of tapping into that community and listening to both their sentiment and to some extent the data. And by and large what we hear there is reassuring that in fact demand is coming back and the virus spread does not appear to be profound. That doesn't tell us for certain where it's going in the next few months, but there is something that's encouraging there. When you go around the world, you're going to see a different dynamic in various parts of the world. I think in Europe, Europe, unlike China and the United States, is meaningfully more dependent on long-haul travel. You think about Europe as being a destination for vacationers from all around the world who want to see those great European cities, and because it's dependent on air and long-haul, I suspect it will be probably the slowest to get back to the kind of levels that we enjoyed before COVID-19. Advantages of China and the United States are they're both domestic markets. Even in normal times, the US is about 95% to 96% US travel with only 4% to 5% in total dependent on in-bound travel from the rest of the world. And by the way Mexico and Canada are both big source markets, and they're obviously fairly close. Sometimes those are drive-to inbound business. Sometimes they're flight, obviously. Looking at the US, which maybe where your question is focused, we obviously see the drive-to markets as being the strongest. You can see that in even the data we showed on select brands in the prepared comments are performing better. And I think that's both leisure and to some extent it is sort of local or regional business, but business that is dependent on the car. And I think that will come back the most. I think we'll see some cities perform better, so a couple of contrasts here. New York may be the stickiest because of its density and its reliance on mass transportation which creates some sense of risk. And so we would suspect \u2013 and also maybe a little bit their dependence on international travel which is higher than the US as a whole. But go to a market like San Antonio or even Chicago, where there is a much more likelihood that people can drive in, in the summertime, be outside, enjoy Lake Michigan or enjoy the outdoor destinations and I think we will see those markets perform better and faster. The slowest bit of business to come back will certainly be group, and we hear from our group customers that they want to get back to a place where they can bring people together, but they obviously want to do that in a way which is safe. And that depends on some things which we can influence like the protocols we use around cleanliness and meetings in the hotels, and we've got great work underway there. On the meeting side, it will include probably lower density in our hotels, in other words, more square footage being used for per head at a meeting than would have been the case beforehand. Maybe sadly, we've got the capacity to do that, but there are parts of this which we won't be able to control to, and to the extent those meetings are dependent on air travel, it's not just going to be how does the plane itself feel and the airlines I think are making good progress there, but how is it getting through the airports and can you get through the security lines in a way that makes sense. I think on balance \u2013 you've heard this a little bit from the industry data which is out there. I think what we're seeing across the United States is folks are tiptoeing out of their homes a bit more the last few weeks. We're probably seeing occupancy click up a point a week or something like that the last few weeks. That's not enough to put a stake in the ground and declare that we've got momentum towards a recovery, given how low the numbers actually are. But it does tell you that the early travellers, which are going to be drive-to leisure, local, domestic, are interested in sort of getting out there and reliving their lives. And if they can do that and over time build confidence, collectively, we can build confidence in the safety that we can enjoy if we're out of our homes, that will get better and better. And if, on the other hand, restrictions are released and the virus spread surges and we can't have that confidence as consumers, it will not be just a question of what the government restrictions are, but it will be a question of what that confidence level is and that will make the recovery slower. Well, we're watching it, I think, is the right answer. Obviously, we're a month and a half into the extraordinary crisis outside of China and a couple of months longer than that in China. In various parts of the world, construction was essentially banned. In some markets, it was an essential service that was allowed to continue. Beyond that, you've got some question about hotels that were ready to open and whether or not the final furniture supply was in-hand or not or whether it was dependent on the global supply chain, which itself slowed down. I think we can say with a relatively high level of confidence that the overwhelming majority of hotels, which were scheduled to open in 2020 would have been very far along in their construction and they will still make sense to reopen, assuming some kind of reasonable assumptions around recovery. And so while there will be delay in getting them opened, we would expect that they will open. Whether that delay is a number of months or a number of quarters probably will depend a little bit on those supply chain dynamics, construction restrictions which by and large have been released. I mean I think California banned construction for a period of time, and I think construction is now back on in California. And just the owners' sense about \u2013 obviously there's less urgency to get open but whether it's more logical to be open or to defer opening. It is likely we will have fewer new hotel openings than we assumed before COVID-19 in 2020. Whether that's down by half or down by a quarter, we'll have to watch and see. I think it's still way too early to identify. I do think that most of the hotels that were scheduled to open in 2020 will ultimately open into our system, and the same I think can be said for certainly most of the first half of 2021 openings as well. Hi, Smedes. Well, it's going to be very interesting I think to watch. I think in the early stages, obviously, we're going to have less F&B service, for example. I think we're likely to have either fewer restaurants open, fewer meetings and the staffing that's associated with meetings, probably a difference in the approach to buffets and some of those sorts of things. So I suspect in the early quarters, it's going to be more grab and go and pre-packaged material, vary a little bit obviously by segment and by market around the world. But I think those things would generally tell you that for the balance of 2020, labor costs as a percentage of revenues are probably likely to be lower. I think when you look longer term, it's going to be interesting. Certainly, in the first stage, we would expect that digital check-in, think about using your phone as a key or checking in at a kiosk, will be important both to protect associates and to protect guests. I think there will be relatively greater effort in housekeeping between guests than there was before to make sure that those rooms are virus-free to the extent we can be certain of that. I suspect there could be relatively less services provided during the stay, however, and those things may offset each other a little bit. But obviously, we'll work our way through that in the best case we can. Long-winded way of saying I think in the near term certainly labor costs will be less, and obviously, we'll be looking longer term at making sure that we meet what our guests' expectations are and that the services provided are the services that are needed by our guests and also making sure that our owners get back to a place where their investments make sense and where their financial well-being is good for the long term. Leeny, you got that? Get back to the same level of profit per room, you're talking about? Yeah, yeah. I don't think it's certainly really not unrealistic to try, and I think we will work hard at that, if not getting back to the same levels, getting to even better levels. I do think that the \u2013 in the first instance, the recovery, top line recovery obviously is really important to this as well as what we do on the cost side. Top line recovery in the first instance is going to be COVID-19 driven. What is the sense of government restriction that gets in the way of our business? And what is the sense of sort of remaining concern or anxiety about the spread of the virus that dampens down demand? And the recovery from that is going to depend significantly on the progress of the virus, the development of a vaccine, the development of other treatments, maybe ubiquity of testing, all the things that are being talked about every day and endlessly every day. I think beyond that, that the question about the top line is going to be driven by the economy. And none of us knows how severe the economic hangover will be when the fear of COVID-19 recedes. But there is every reason to suspect that there may be some stickiness to a weaker demand environment, at least for a period of time, simply because of GDP activity. And so, those things I think are both important from a top line perspective. From a cost perspective, we will obviously do the kinds of things that we're going to do. To the extent the top line is depriving us of dollars per room of revenue, that challenge becomes a little bit more significant. But I think as we move our way down the recovery and we see revenue per room come back, we ought to have a fighting chance at getting profits per room back too. Good morning. Well, we call that Marriott Bonvoy. I think as of the end of the quarter, we're at 142,000 members or something like that. And I think the program remains a powerful tool for us to drive loyalty of travelers to our brands. And we'll continue to stay focused on making sure that program is strong and is relevant to folks, both as they travel and when they're not traveling, and I think that will be the principal tool in our toolkit. Beyond that, of course, it's the questions that are sometimes related, sometimes mutually reinforcing of that but it is the breadth of distribution. It is hotels that continue to inspire people when they dream about travel, which is often about resort destinations and about luxury and lifestyle hotels, not exclusively, but that certainly is a piece of that. And I think our portfolio there is extraordinarily strong. And then questions about how do we go to market with the sales force and how do we make sure we're delivering the kinds of operational excellence which Marriott has long been known for. I think all of those things will remain tools that we rely on. We're disappointed obviously by COVID-19 for so many reasons, but partly the momentum that we had built in the latter part of 2019 and which continued into 2020 with, as we mentioned, 330 basis points of index growth in January and February, which are massive numbers for a portfolio of our size, speak very well for our ability to get back there and rebuild that momentum. There's nothing about COVID-19 which should disrupt that momentum in the years ahead. You bet. So, Leeny, you may have this data top of mind. I'm not sure I do. But if you look through cycles, and this would be directional, not probably as concrete as you'd like, Robin, in a weaker environment, conversions go up. They go up for us. They go up for the stronger brands, because not every hotel can perform as well in a weaker environment. And so, we're already seeing conversations pop up where folks are looking at oh, my goodness, how do I get this hotel reopened, and don't I need a pipeline of customers in a loyalty program today more than I needed six months ago or three months ago. And so, all of that will help. I think at the same time, it's fair to say that while conversions step up in a weaker environment, new builds step down and they probably step down at least as much as the conversions step up. And so, we would, if you look at 2010, 2011, 2012, the hotels that were under construction before the Great Recession continued to open into our system. But we had not signed hotels, new hotels in 2009 and 2010 at the kind of pace that we had before the Great Recession hit. And so we end up with a percentage unit growth even with the benefit of conversions which is certainly not higher than what we would have had before and, if my recollection serves, would, on average, have been a little bit lower. I think when we look now into the next period of time, I think our brands are stronger, I think the portfolio is stronger, I think the momentum with the loyalty program and our index numbers are stronger. All of which will bode well for conversion activity as by the way is the depth of the decline in performance of the industry as a whole, which gives then much more motivation I think for owners to move. At the same time, as Leeny has just gone through, I think we're going to see that while the banks are much stronger than they've been in the prior crises, they will inevitably pause and either require more equity or get to see whether or not we can get more clarity before they're going to provide the kind of financing commitments that they were providing before COVID-19 hit. Put all those things together, I suspect we'll find opportunities here. But we will be less likely to be seeing an increase near term in net rooms openings into our system than a decrease. Leeny, do you disagree? Good morning. Yeah, it's a fair question and obviously one that has been raised a few times. I think there are obvious differences between management and franchise. The franchise model is dramatically more prevalent in the lower segments of the industry. Franchising is also dramatically more prevalent in the US than it is in other markets around the world. And there are obviously different reasons for those distinctions. One is that the farther up the chain scale you go, the more likely you're getting into group, the more likely you're getting into luxury, the greater premium is placed on operational expertise. And by no means do I mean to suggest that there aren't franchisees that have expertise that is able to do that. But not all franchisees do and in some markets of the world, those franchisees by and large have not existed yet. I think that there is room for us to consider whether in some of the lower segments we have more management than we need to have, whether we've had sort of a cultural bias towards management that is unnecessary. At the same time, I think the power of the luxury brands, the power of the lifestyle brands, the power in the group space, the power in food and beverage, I for one wouldn't trade that away. I think that is something that is going to drive the stickiness of the loyalty program, drive aspirational travel, drive higher-end travel which will continue to be strong. And we want very much to keep that as a prominent and industry-leading part of our portfolio and would not trade Marriott's model for being purely in the lower segments. There might be a different risk profile there, but there's also a different upside this year. Oh, no, I don't think so. The amount of money we've invested in Homes & Villas is really very modest. You're talking about a handful of millions of dollars, something like that, to keep the business up and running. And I think the way we've positioned that business, which is the higher end of the home-sharing space sort of skewing towards whole home and luxury which is quite different from traditional hotel product and has different dynamics I think too in a COVID-19 environment, because you're not really sharing a part of a home and you're ending up in a place which I think can be where we can deliver the kind of professional services that we like to deliver which suggests there's still opportunity for that. It is, as a consequence, I think something that we will continue to pay attention to. Yeah, I would think so. I mean, it's obviously a tiny business for us by comparison to what we're doing, and it is leisure focused, more leisure focused than our hotel business is. There could be some modest differences in the way that the ramp occurs. I wouldn't think they're very dramatic though. You bet. Hey, Michael. We've asked that question too. You may have noticed that when you check into a hotel we actually don't typically ask people how they came. And so we've looked at this a little bit based on other data sources. And it won't surprise you to learn that it varies dramatically from market to market. The select brands in the United States are going to be much less dependent on fly-to business than some markets where basically you can't get there unless you fly. Think about the Canary Islands as an example. Our estimate is it's probably half, something like that. But again, in a way you've got to be careful about a global average because it hides dramatic variation within it. You bet. [indiscernible] started construction. So I think the number we shared with you \u2013 and jump in here, team, if I'm remembering this wrong \u2013 230,000 of the 516,000 are under construction. So that's like 40%, something like that. 45% maybe. In that range. And so that's the concrete number we can give you. I think what happens with this, the balance that are not under construction over the course of the next couple of years, there's a few things to bear in mind here. One is that hotels are not entering that pipeline until typically they have been worked for a substantial period of time. It could be a year on average, although I'm guessing here a little bit where an owner is identifying a site, doing detailed work about how much it's going to cost to build it, doing pro formas about what the returns are going to be and it is not, even though it may not be under construction, it is something which is very serious. We're not putting deals in our pipeline, for example, just because somebody shows up and says I want to build a courtyard in X market, but I haven't identified the site yet or I don't have a specific deal to get done. And when viewed in that context, I don't think it is at all surprising that 60 days into a crisis like this one that has a fairly uncertain path out that people are being tentative about making permanent decisions about killing deals that they've worked on for a period of time. I think the second thing to bear in mind is while we certainly have suffered a substantial hit in terms of top line performance, we will all be looking together to see what the best thinking can be about when that top line comes back. And for hotels that have not yet been built, what is the advantage that is available to me, if I can get it financed at a lower construction cost? And if I'm not open and I'm not going to be open for the two or three years that I need to be under construction, which may coincide with the weaker demand environment and also the weaker construction environment, my deal actually may be a decent deal and I may decide to pursue it. I probably won't accelerate my construction until I get smarter about thinking that through, but there will be upsides as well as downsides associated with this weakness for projects that are not yet under construction. Well, I think we'll watch that obviously. We want to make sure that we're not dropping rate to chase demand, which is not there and that obviously does nothing for us. At the same time, we compete in an industry which is highly distributed in terms of its pricing. And this is one of the challenges that we bear perpetually. People view us as, okay, you're the largest hotel company in the world, doesn't that give you pricing power. Well, the fact of the matter is, even as the largest hotel company in the world, we've only got \u2013 what's our global distribution, Leeny? 14%? 15%? Something like that of all rooms in the world? And a significant number... And many of those rooms are priced by our franchisees, not priced by Marriott. And so we will \u2013 we're not going to push rates down by any means. We're going to do everything we can to make sure we're maintaining pricing power, but there will be price competition in our industry too as we try and get demand energized and coming back into the system. And we'll do the best we can, making the kinds of judgments that need to be made. Hi, Rich. And the cost is less than our last bond deal. You bet. Thank you all very much for your time this morning. We appreciate obviously your interest in us and in the recovery of Marriott and the industry. Wishing nothing but the best as we work our way through this challenging time, as a business, as an industry and as society. But know that we'll be there to welcome you as soon as you get back on the road with bells on. Thank you."

            "name": "Kathleen Kelly Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Arne. I hope all of you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I also want to thank our teams around the globe for their dedication and tireless efforts during these unprecedented times. Worldwide RevPAR was down 22.5% for the quarter, driven by the sharp 60% global decline in March. First quarter gross fee revenues totaled $629 million comprised of $214 million of base management fees and $415 million of franchise fees. Under the terms of our contracts, our portfolio of managed hotels earned $64 million of incentive management fees or IMFs in the first quarter. However, under accounting rules we can only recognize IMFs to the extent that the full-year forecast supports that these fees will not be reversed later in the year. At this point, there is significant uncertainty around full year performance, so we did not recognize any IMFs in the quarter. Within franchise fees, other non-RevPAR related fees totalled approximately $140 million, up 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by stable year-over-year credit card and time share branding fees as well as higher year-over-year residential branding fees. Adjusted EBITDA of $442 million included $79 million of bad debt expense and guarantee reserves related to COVID-19. Given the uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a recovery, we're unable to provide our normal quarterly and full year P&L guidance. Instead, I thought it would be helpful to talk through a modelling scenario for our monthly run-rate of major sources and uses of cash in the current environment with worldwide RevPAR down roughly 90% and also provide you with a few modelling sensitivities. Note that this is just one scenario and not an estimate of actual results. Marriott's overall cash flow is easiest to describe in two broad categories. The first category is classic cash flow at the corporate level, which is basically EBITDA less cash interest expense, cash taxes and investment spending. The second category relates to our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses, which represent the costs that we charge out to our owners and franchisees to cover the programs and services we provide to them. Starting with corporate cash, at these extraordinarily low levels of RevPAR, we assume net cash outflows of roughly $90 million to $95 million per month. That's assuming cash sources of around $60 million to $65 million, and cash uses of about $155 million per month. The cash inflows are base management and franchise fees and other non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Given we are not currently recognizing any incentive fees due to the uncertainties around full year results, it's easiest to model RevPAR related base management and franchise fees based on 2019 actuals. If you adjust those for unit growth and the 90% decline in RevPAR, the result is roughly $20 million to $25 million of fees a month per point of RevPAR. Also, as a sensitivity for you, the impact of a 1 point change in RevPAR would be roughly $2 million of fees per month. As RevPAR climbs back closer to prior year levels, obviously the improvement in fees per point of RevPAR grows significantly. In this scenario, the remaining $40 million per month of fees is expected to come primarily from other non-RevPAR related franchise fees, mainly credit card branding fees, residential branding fees and timeshare royalty fees, all of which are much more stable. Assuming RevPAR is down 90%, we expect that corporate cash outflows could total approximately $155 million per month. Compared to our 2020 budget, we've reduced our cash run-rate for corporate G&A by 30% excluding bad debt to about $40 million per month. And we've eliminated or deferred around 45% of our original investment spending forecast of $700 million to $800 million for the full year, bringing our investment spending to roughly $35 million per month. The remaining $80 million per month includes cash interest expense, cash tax payments and the monthly cash outflows for our owned/leased hotel portfolio in this exceedingly low RevPAR environment. The second category of cash flows relates to the revenues and expenses for the programs and services that we provide to our hotels, for which we're entitled to reimbursement. As you know, our spend in reimbursement for hotel level programs and services are meant to net to zero over time, yet there can be timing differences between dollars we spend and dollars we collect. I'll break this second category of cash flows into two buckets. The first is the cash flow related to the Marriott Bonvoy program and the second is the timing of all our other programs and services. Cash flows into the loyalty program from hotels and our co-brand credit card issuers as members earn points. The cash outflows for Bonvoy are the payments made to hotels when members redeem points as well as the costs of running the program including marketing. This year, we expect to have much lower redemption expenses in terms of both volume of nights and the rate paid for those stays, given lower occupancies. At the current low occupancy rates, we estimate that we will generate several hundred million dollars of cash from the loyalty program this year or $45 million of cash benefit a month. This does not include the cash we recently received from our co-brand credit card issuers. That leaves the remainder of our cost reimbursement revenues and reimbursed expenses. A largest bucket is the direct pass-through of payroll and other operational costs at our hotels, primarily for our North American managed hotels. In 2019, these costs were around 75% of the more than $16 billion of GAAP reimbursed expenses. So far this year, we have reduced these pass-through costs by around two-thirds. These expenses are generally repaid to us within days, and in 2019, managed owners reimbursed us with very little exception or delay. At this point, a very small fraction of these managed hotels are delayed in paying us. Apart from these hotel level costs and loyalties, the remaining reimbursed expenses in 2019 supported mandatory programs and services we provide to our hotels. They cover brand sales and marketing funds, our reservation system, property management systems and the like. About two-thirds of the amounts charged to hotels to cover these costs, which are also included in cost reimbursement revenues, vary based on hotel level revenues or program usage with the remaining being a fixed charge per hotel or per key. That lines up well with our cost to provide these services, which are also about two-thirds variable and one-third fixed. With the significant cost cuts and changes we've implemented in this low RevPAR environment, we believe that the cost reimbursement revenues due would cover our reimbursed expenses. But there could be some cash timing mismatch given the systems fee discount and payment deferral we provided for April and May as well as owners and franchisees extending their payables a bit. In this very low demand scenario, we could see roughly $100 million a month of higher working capital usage before considering the loyalty cash inflows. The net cash outflow for all programs and services including the positive cash flow from loyalty could be around $55 million a month, which brings the total company cash use to roughly $145 million to $150 million a month. It's worth noting that in April, despite the 90% decline in RevPAR, the company's cash burn rate was significantly better than that estimate. And of course, as trends improve, the cash burn rate should improve as well. I want to remind you that when you look on the P&L for cost reimbursement revenue and reimbursed expenses, it will look a bit different than the cash flows I've just described, primarily due to the accounting for the loyalty program which requires that, as cash is received, it goes on to our balance sheet as deferred revenue with no immediate impact on the P&L. We've been focused on preserving liquidity and shoring up our cash position. In mid-April, we issued $1.6 billion of five-year senior notes, and last week, we raised another $920 million through amendments to our co-brand credit card deals. We also eliminated dividends and share repurchases until further notice. Our current cash and cash equivalent amount on hand is around $3.9 billion. If you add to that cash, the undrawn capacity on our revolver of $1.3 billion, which we paid back on May 1, and deduct around $900 million of commercial paper currently outstanding, our net liquidity today is roughly $4.3 billion. We know the recovery could take a while, but we're confident we have the liquidity we need to manage through this situation, including paying back near-term debt maturities. We've made solid progress in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and are prepared for the wide range of scenarios that could play out. We feel confident that we will come through this successfully and look forward to traveling and welcoming all of you at our hotels. Thank you for your time this morning, and we will now open the line for questions. Good morning, Shaun. So, a couple things. First, I'll remind everybody once again that a huge proportion of our fees that we charge are revenue-based, so there is an automatic decline that has happened as a result of the drop in RevPAR. So that if you think about it for the mandatory programs and services that we charge, when you also include the deferral and the 50% discount that we gave in April and May, there's actually very little due at the moment from \u2013 on the mandatory programs and services. At the managed hotels in North America, we have also, as I talked about, dropped payroll incredibly, as well as all the operating costs at the hotels. So of course, you do have owners, just as we too are thinking about how we are managing our payables, everybody's trying to manage their cash as best they can. But I will say, our owners and franchisees are paying their bills. We have a really very, very small fraction of our hotels that are having trouble paying at the moment, and then except for a bit of extended payable terms that you can see, otherwise, it's really all systems go for the moment. And as I said in April, we actually saw, relative to those numbers I gave, really a fairly dramatically better situation than the one that I gave you, but we wanted you to have the benefit of our cash planning so that we are making sure that, no matter the situation, that we're able to manage through it. You too, Joe. Good morning. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I think as you know, we typically really use our capital to propel our growth. Now, we do obviously from time to time work with an owner in a specific situation, particularly when there's reinvestment going into a property as we have done with Host, for example. But I think, broadly speaking, we have reimbursables. We expect to get paid. We provide those programs and services, and the owners have an obligation to pay us. So while there is an ongoing dialogue and we certainly, as you've seen from all of our efforts to reduce our costs as well as to defer the payment of some mandatory required fees, then wanting to be understanding about the situation. But at the same time, I would not expect to see that we would be doing extensive either guarantees or loans to deal with this. So first of all, on the impairment charge, if you think about the biggest chunks of the impairment charge today, two of them were related to leases. They are leases that have been around, and as you know with the lease accounting change, we have these assets on our books called right of use assets that extend over the life of the lease. So frankly, they really don't relate to the classic sort of giving of key money with that. And frankly, there was one impairment charge that we took this quarter that we mentioned, the $14 million, that's on a very large portfolio of limited service hotels. And as part of that transaction, there was an agreement by the owner to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvent those properties. So quite frankly, still a transaction that was in the broader scheme of keeping up our portfolio and making them competitive, make a ton of sense. Now, I think, in general, as you think about what we have to invest in our pipeline, it's actually fairly small. It tends to be that on the more complex higher-end projects that we at the margin are going to have a little bit more capital in than if it's on a kind of small price-limited service hotel. But I think fundamentally, we still view that the way that we approach investing in deals to be appropriate. Now, at the same time, I will say we are obviously cognizant of kind of where we are from a liquidity standpoint as well as rebuilding the business over the next few years. So when we think about, for example, our restrictions that we have put into our revolver covenant waiver, we're obviously going to keep very closely, a very close watch on the amounts of investment that we're spending. But I think from a fundamental approach, we still feel really good about the value that we are driving with these key money type of investment. Good morning, Anthony. Well, I'll start. And then, Arne, feel free to add on. So I think first of all, let's talk about what's already under construction. The financial institutions today are in vastly better health than they were back in the Great Recession. And as Arne was saying earlier, these deals still make sense. They're under construction. There's no reason to think that they won't get finished as the final supplies are delivered and they have the ability to open. Now, could it be that they open a bit later, depending on the environment for demand? Sure. But again, from everything we hear anecdotally as well as see \u2013 I don't know if you notice around your towns that construction actually is one of the few businesses that you can actually still see a fair amount going on. And so, as you then think about the pipeline of new deals, I think that clearly is one that there's more question around and that there is likely to be at least a bit more of a wait-and-see attitude by the lenders on committing to new deals. However, the one thing I will say is that as you think about, if they are going to lend, who are they going to lend to, it's kind of classically been the case that the stronger brands get the financing when deals are getting done. And I would expect with all that you've heard around what we're doing related to cleanliness and making sure that the guests know the standards that they can expect our hotels to have when they come, that will continue to be one of the strong points that our brands have when a developer goes to consider getting a loan. And the other thing I'll say that the conversations that our developers are having continue apace. Obviously, conversion activity is up right now as we think about those conversations as well as then continued on new construction. These are folks who are looking for the longer term, and from a longer term perspective, they still view it quite strongly. No, I totally agree. The only thing I'll add, Robin, is one of the differences between now and the Great Recession is our strong portfolio of soft brands, and frankly, the interest that we're seeing in those brands around the world. So the conversion vehicles that we have now as compared to 12 years ago, I do think are meaningfully stronger, which I think is helpful. I think the financing realities are going to stay the same, so that's kind of we're going to have to \u2013 if somebody's looking for financing or refinancing to do a deal, we'll have to work through that in the demand environment with COVID. But I do think that we've got the right portfolio of brands, kind of across all 30. And we definitely are seeing increasing conversations. But as Arne said, if you're looking at kind of normally maybe 15% to 20% of your room openings are conversion and let's say that number goes up to a third, that still is not going to offset what you're seeing in terms of the slowdown in new construction. In North America, it's going to be overwhelmingly that way. So if you think about in full service, the full service rooms that we opened may be about call it 25%, 20% of our room openings in North America, because limited service is such a big chunk in our current pipeline, not of the existing stock but of the room openings, they're going to overwhelmingly be soft brand, either new build or conversions. So I'd say we can get you the specific numbers, but a good percentage. Yeah, sure. As you know, the new accounting standard called CECL, better known as CECL, does it a little bit differently than the way that bad debt was done for us before, and it's an accounting standard that everybody out there has got to follow. And before, for us, it was truly writing them off once it was very clear that the receivable was absolutely uncollectible. The requirement now is a little bit more as you think about like a classic loan portfolio for a bank, where it has to have obviously what you reflect as uncollectible, but also an estimate of future expected losses. So it requires that you go when you're looking at your past history of your receivables and making an estimate based on performance of where they will prove out, and so you actually are taking a classic loan loss provision against that base of receivables as well as when you've actually got a specific receivable that's deemed uncollectable. So as you can see in the number that we talked about, $65 million, as part of what was in G&A this quarter, that obviously is meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. So it's got whatever ones that we very specifically deem uncollectible but also given the environment an estimate of future expected losses. I'm sure they're listening to this call, so I would say, no. No. I think that's, as you know, is overwhelmingly a fixed charge, and we feel great about our partner, Marriott Vacations Worldwide, and we do not believe that there is risk associated with that fee. Good morning. Well, again, I think as I talked about before, we've done a remarkable job of being able to reduce our costs down to this level where we were able to offer this and still feel like we'll be able to recoup our expenses in providing these kind of basic mandatory programs and services. So I don't expect at this point that we would be looking at offering a further discount. Oh, sorry. Yes. September. Yeah. Mostly in the third quarter. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I can give you that. So roughly 16,000 are pending conversions, and then as we said in the press release, about 24,000 are approved, but not yet signed. All the rest are new build pending construction starts. Call it, roughly 240,000, broadly speaking. 7% percent globally. 16%, North America, 16%. 3% outside of the world. So, as you know, you basically are looking every month at the expectation of the performance against a budget and against a target, depending on what the contract requires. So if there's an owner's priority then you need to have exceeded that but again, based on that month's performance expectation. The issue, however, becomes you don't actually technically earn it at the end of the year, until you see what the full year performance is. So based on, for example, January and February which were really terrific and really strong performance, we clearly were clicking along, doing well, and as I said, now would have locked in early on $64 million of incentive fees, however, even despite Greater China starting to really feel some impact in February and March. But when we look, knowing as we enter into April that you're looking at 90% decline in RevPAR, our comfort that we can feel secure, that we won't have to give those back is not great enough for us to feel like that we can recognize them as income. Sure. So let me do this, and then, Arne, obviously jump in. Think about it this way, that as people spend on their credit cards, our credit card issuers pay us an agreed amount of money, based on that credit card spend. And that is to compensate us for obviously being a part of the Bonvoy program and also for being able to affiliate with the Marriott brands. So when you think about that kind of amount over a number of years, there's kind of an expectation about how much you could be collecting in revenues from the credit card companies. And basically, it's getting some of it upfront. So what will happen over the next several years is what they will pay us based on the amount of credit card spend will be moderately a modest amount less than they otherwise would have paid us. So if you think about it from a kind of classic cost of capital, it's extremely efficient and economic for Marriott to have. It also doesn't have obviously any of the classic characteristics of debt in terms of required repayment terms, et cetera. So it's really, again, overwhelmingly a reflection of monies that we receive earlier that then will get essentially paid back by them paying us less than they otherwise would have over the next several years. . Meaningfully. Thank you very much."

[Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJackie Burka: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on this day, which marks the 1-year anniversary of Arne's passing. I know everyone on this call, especially our Marriott associates, miss our dear friend, an inspirational leader, a great deal. We can take comfort knowing his amazing legacy lives on in the incredible work of the thousands of people around the world who wear a Marriott name badge. Let me turn the call back over to Jackie to get us underway in discussing this quarter's results.\nJackie Burka : So let me quickly remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2021, even if they were not open and fully operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website.  Tony?\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie. We're very pleased with the remarkable progress we made in 2021 across the entire global portfolio despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished the year on a real high note with the emergence of Omicron having a limited impact on results in the fourth quarter. In December, global ADR was 3% above 2019 levels, and occupancy for the month gained further ground compared to December of 2019, driving global RevPAR to an 11% decline versus 2019. This was a 53 percentage point improvement from the RevPAR decline in January of 2021. In the fourth quarter, global RevPAR was 19% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Global occupancy for the quarter came in at 58%, 12 percentage points below 2019, while ADR was only 2% shy of 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 15% compared to 2019. Results were driven by strong ADR, which was less than 2% below pre-pandemic levels. Further strengthening of already robust leisure travel and steady improvement in the recovery of business transient and group demand also helped results. Fourth quarter group room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was down 32% versus 2019, a 9%-point improvement from the third quarter decline. With booking windows still much shorter than usual, in the quarter for the quarter bookings were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Group cancellations ticked up late last year and early this year due to Omicron mostly for arrival dates in January and February, but those cancellations have slowed more recently. New group bookings have also been gaining momentum, especially in the year for the year. In fact, just last week, Salesforce held a large company meeting in New York City that was booked just 1 month before the event. It was the largest internal meeting Salesforce has held since the start of the pandemic with over 25,000 room nights across 11 of our properties. While special corporate demand in the U.S. and Canada was still well below '19 levels, there was gradual improvement in the fourth quarter. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, bookings in the quarter were down 33%, 11% -- excuse me, 11 percentage points better than the decline in the bookings in the third quarter. Weekly bookings around the end of last year were impacted by Omicron, but they have recovered since the trough in early January. All of our international regions, except for Greater China, posted sequential RevPAR recovery from the third to the fourth quarter as more borders reopened and travel restrictions eased. Greater China's fourth quarter 27% RevPAR decline compared to 2019 was in line with the decline in the third quarter as their zero COVID policy once again resulted in the lockdown of several cities. The Middle East and Africa or MEA region performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, really demonstrating the resilience of travel demand. With relatively high vaccination rates and low travel restrictions during the quarter, the Middle East has become a safe, easy place to visit. Led by strength in the UAE, fourth quarter RevPAR in MEA rose 8% in 2019 driven by 20% higher ADR -- excuse me, 8% above '19 driven by 20% higher ADR. Fourth quarter occupancy in MEA topped 65%, the highest of our regions. Leisure demand was remarkably strong, benefiting from a significant increase in international visitors. Room nights from international guests rose nearly 60% from the third to the fourth quarter. Throughout the pandemic, strengthening our valuable loyalty platform and engaging with our Marriott Bonvoy members have been key areas of focus. In the fourth quarter of '21, 52% of room nights globally and 58% of room nights in the U.S. and Canada were booked by Bonvoy members. And global membership grew to over 160 million members at year-end driven by strong digital sign-ups. Turning to development. Both room additions and signings were strong in '21 despite ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. Despite industry-wide preconstruction and construction delays, some labor shortages and supply chain issues, we added a record 86,000 gross rooms and 517 properties leading to 6.1% gross rooms growth for the year. Our global net rooms growth was 3.9%, above our previous expectation, given deletions were towards the low end of those expectations. Our deletion rate for 2021 was 2.1% or 1.2% excluding the exit of 88 Service Properties Trust hotels. We are also pleased that we continue to grow our share of rooms globally. In 2021, around 15% of all global new build rooms opened under our brands compared to our year-end room share of 7%. This share is expected to continue as we had 18% of all global rooms under construction at the end of '21, more than twice our current share of open rooms. Our development team signed franchise and management agreements for approximately 92,000 rooms during 2021, and our year-end global pipeline totaled roughly 485,000 rooms. The composition of our pipeline dovetails nicely with current demand trends. Leisure demand has led to recovery, and we are well positioned to continue growing our lead in resort destinations, including in the high-growth, all-inclusive space. We've also been seeing strong preference for our luxury properties. With luxury rooms accounting for more than 10% of our pipeline, we are poised to further expand our industry-leading portfolio in this valuable high-fee segment. Conversions were a significant growth driver in 2021, accounting for 21% of room additions and 27% of signings. With the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of our system, we anticipate that conversions will remain an important contributor to growth over the next several years. For 2022, we expect gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. As a reminder, average construction time lines are currently around 2 years for limited service deals and often longer for full service deals. Yet given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our conversion momentum and our industry-leading pipeline, we are confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I did want to share a few highlights of the company's ESG efforts over the course of the year. The Board of Directors and our management team are keenly focused on these important areas as we're committed to making a positive and sustainable impact in the communities where we live and work. In June, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we announced we were setting new internal diversity goals for our group of Vice Presidents and above. The new targets aim to achieve global gender parity by 2023, an acceleration of our prior timetable and to increase representation of people of color in the U.S. to 25% by 2025. In July, we updated our human trafficking awareness training, which will be made widely available to the entire industry. More than 900,000 associates have now taken training in this area. And in September, we pledged to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius emissions scenarios. As I finish my first year as CEO, I want to again thank our incredible associates for all their hard work through these challenging times. I've spent most of the last few months on the road, traveling across the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles and also abroad and have seen firsthand their dedication to serving our guests. I'm so proud of all we've accomplished over the last year and continue to be very optimistic about our outlook for 2022 and beyond.  Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg : Thank you, Tony. Our fourth quarter results reflect the clear resilience of travel, our strong focus on cost containment and the benefits of our asset-light business model. Gross fee revenues reached $831 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $186 million in the fourth quarter 19% ahead of 2019 levels driven by robust global card spending and new account acquisitions as well as outstanding performance in our branded residential business. Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $94 million in the quarter. Just under half of these fees were earned at resort properties with IMF from our comparable luxury resorts up almost 45% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our owned and leased portfolio generated $19 million of profits, a nice increase from a loss of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as results improved at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Our operating teams have done extraordinary work to adapt quickly and return these hotels to breakeven profitability or better despite continued lower-than-normal occupancy levels. G&A and other expense totaled $213 million in the fourth quarter, higher than prior expectations as a result of higher compensation costs, including true-ups and higher legal expenses. For full year 2021, G&A and other came in at $823 million, 12% lower than full year 2019, reflecting ongoing savings resulting from our significant restructuring activities in 2020. At the hotel level, we have partnered with our owners and franchisees throughout the pandemic, working diligently to lower costs, bring down breakeven occupancy levels and drive cash flow. With the recovery well underway, we're committed to delivering consistent and positive guest experiences while keeping hotel operating costs down. Many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we put into place will be maintained as occupancies rebound. While the labor environment is slowly improving, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation. We're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As always, we are also carefully managing cash outlays at the corporate level. We were pleased with our cash flow generation during 2021 and with our year-end liquidity position of over $4.8 billion, which covers near-term debt maturities with significant cushion. Our full year cash flows from the loyalty program were positive before considering the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which effectively repaid around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, loyalty cash flows were modestly negative. Looking ahead to 2022, there is still too much uncertainty and volatility to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again share some general observations and provide color on certain specific items where we do have some visibility. I'll start with some thoughts on the first quarter of 2022. Omicron meaningfully impacted global group and business transient demand in January, historically the lowest occupancy month of the year. While we saw minimal disruption to leisure travel, global RevPAR for the month declined 31% compared to January of '19 primarily due to lower occupancy as rate was just 4% below 2019. We expect to see the recovery pace pick up nicely in February and March given weekly bookings across customer segments have now returned to pre-Omicron levels. However, with some countries reinstituting strict travel restrictions earlier this year, we could see first quarter 2022 RevPAR compared to '19 levels take a step back from the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of '21 versus 2019. We then expect significant forward progression in the global recovery each quarter through the end of the year. Following the temporary Delta-related slowdown during the third quarter of last year, demand picked up meaningfully through the end of last year. That bolsters our optimism that by the end of the year, the 2022 fourth quarter gap to 2019 fourth quarter RevPAR will narrow meaningfully compared to the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of 2021. As additional markets reopen and more employees return to the office, we expect robust ADR, sustained strong leisure transient demand and significant improvement in business transient and group. We also expect to see growth in trips that blend business and leisure. International travelers getting back on the road should also drive further improvement in RevPAR. In 2019, nearly 20% of global room nights were from cross-border guests. So far, most global demand during the pandemic has come from domestic visitors. Cross-border room nights in 2021 were down more than 60% compared to 2019 while domestic room nights were down 16% over the same time period. Our fourth quarter performance in the Middle East illustrates how impactful the return of international travel can be. We're encouraged by the swift pickup in booking activity that we've seen in the last few weeks in places that are opening up, such as Thailand and the Cayman Islands. Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year '22 RevPAR versus full year '21 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. This sensitivity is no longer compared to 2019 as the compounding impact from new rooms growth contributions makes the comparison less relevant 3 years out. In 2022, we expect continued growth from our non-RevPAR-related fees driven by higher contributions from credit card fees. We also anticipate profit growth from our owned and leased portfolio as the global environment improves. For the full year, interest expense net is anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is expected to be around 23%. G&A and other expenses could total $860 million to $880 million, still well below 2019 levels but higher on a year-over-year basis primarily due to higher compensation costs and assumed higher travel expenses. As always, driving cash flow will be a priority in 2022. We anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We expect cash flows from loyalty to be slightly positive in 2022 before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. We made great progress in improving our credit ratios during 2021 and remain focused on bringing our leverage in line with our target of 3 to 3.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Assuming the recovery continues largely as anticipated, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We would likely begin by paying a dividend with a payout ratio a bit below our traditional 30%. We can then see more meaningful levels of capital returns, including share repurchases, along with dividends in 2023 and beyond. Over the last 2 years, our business has been tested in ways we never could have imagined. We're incredibly proud of how our teams have adapted and how well our company has performed. We made significant progress in 2021 and are excited about continued recovery and our growth opportunities ahead. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: So Tony, I just wanted to start with development activity. So thank you for the net unit growth guidance, and I think it makes sense relative to where we are in the development cycle. I sort of wanted to get your sense a little bit longer term. Do you think this is the bottom, and these levels are pretty sustainable just given where we are in the broader kind of CapEx and development cycle? Or do you think 2020 -- just help us think through maybe 2023? And are the levels going to be consistent with that? Could we even be a little bit better? Or do we need to be cautious there just given the timing on openings in full service?\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Shaun. Well, as we've said the last couple of quarters, the ripple effects of the pandemic create less visibility beyond '22 than we might like. With that said, I think you heard the momentum on signings in my prepared remarks. We continue to see good volume on the conversion front. In the short term, obviously, we've got a bit of challenges in terms of construction starts, particularly in the U.S. But in some ways, that causes us to think about it as a when, not an if. And in fact, one of the statistics we look at most closely is fallout from the pipeline. If we were seeing wholesale project cancellations, that might cause us to think differently about the medium to long term. But in fact, what we saw in 2021 was about 6.5% lower than our average fallout over the last decade.\nShaun Kelley: Really encouraging. And then maybe just as my follow-up, your comment on the RevPAR cadence, Leeny, in your prepared remarks, was interesting as we get to kind of the 4Q '22 area. Just any possibility that we could actually see maybe a month or a point in 2022 where we actually return to 2019 levels of RevPAR? Or kind of what's your sense about that cadence? That's it for me.\nLeeny Oberg: So thanks very much. And it is interesting. When you look at December, for example, the U.S. and Canada in the month of December was really -- was down only 6 percentage points compared to 2019. So it is absolutely the case that you could see depending on the mix of business and exactly how countries open up and kind of the classic occupancy from a seasonal pattern standpoint. I could imagine that it's possible that you have that happen, Shaun. I think though, so much of this really depends on the global picture in terms of the pace of the recovery. So you need lots of things happening on all the points of business, not just leisure but also special corporate as well as group to see us get to that delightful place. But at the same time, I think we feel great about the momentum. The other comment I'll make is when you see countries open up their restrictions, the kind of jolt that our reservation centers feel is impressive. And I do think that momentum gives us confidence that we could see this resilience continue to build.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Just thinking about the visibility of recovery. Can you give us some insight into what group bookings for the second half look like? Because understandably, of course, Q1 would have been very disrupted by Omicron. But for second half, how is that compared to 2019 levels in terms of -- it seems like at some point, there should be an accumulation of groups that haven't met in a while, and that, that should start to look good. And I'm just wondering if you can see that turning point yet in your future group bookings.\nTony Capuano: Yes. Thanks, Robin. And maybe I'll refresh some of the data that we shared with you last quarter. I'm going to give you some comparisons between at the end of '19, what we saw is definite bookings on the books for '20 and '21 and how that compares at the end of '21, what we see on the books for '22 and '23. So at the end of December of '21 as we looked at definite bookings for '22, we were down just a shade under 22% compared to end of '19 for '20. When we look at what's on the books for '23 at the end of 2021, we're down just a shade under 15% versus what we had on the books at the end of '19 for 2021. And so to your specific question, we are seeing steady and encouraging forward bookings in the group segment. And the other thing I would point out, Robin, you heard in my prepared remarks the comment about that big piece of Salesforce business that was booked just 1 month before. We expect to continue to see improvement from the levels I just described to you because we're seeing more short-term bookings, and that's been the trend over the last number of weeks and months.\nLeeny Oberg: Just to add one point, Robin, when you look at Q1, understandably, with Omicron, clearly, you're looking at a weaker group picture than you are as you get into Q3, which is meaningfully better. So your point is well taken that it should move as we go through the year. And I think the other part that is just fantastic is that rate both in '22 and '23 already from what's on the books is up 3% to 4%.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up question is in terms of the visibility of just sort of business transient or transient in total, has that moved out? And I know it's tough after the last 6 weeks because maybe it was moving out and now contracted a little bit. But how far in advance -- I feel like pre-pandemic, you used to talk about a 30-day booking window, and maybe last year, it was like a 7-day booking window. So just wondering if you're seeing transient a little more visibility or a little bit of improvement in the pace of that?\nLeeny Oberg: So the booking window has extended, but it is not the way it was back in 2019. So it's improved, but it is still the case that we're not back to where we are. And I think, clearly, in Q1, Robin, January is a great example where you saw special corporate particularly weaker with what was going on with Omicron. So I think part of this, you're going to see it get -- see more visibility as we get further and further into the year. But it is a bit better than it was in 2020.\nTony Capuano: And Robin, let me just give you a little more granular information to try to address your question. This is a global number. But if you look at the global booking window, it really got the shortest in the second quarter of 2020, where it was down to 5 years.\nLeeny Oberg: 5 days.\nTony Capuano: Excuse me, 5 days. If you look at fourth quarter of 2021, it had risen to about 17 days. So to Leeny's point, certainly not back to where we were pre-pandemic, but trending in the right direction.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff : Throughout much of last year, leisure demand was fairly inelastic to rate in the industry's fairly robust rate gain as you alluded to this morning. Can you talk about leisure price elasticity thus far in 2022 in your forward bookings? And are there any changes relative to last year, i.e. are you seeing demand become more sensitive to further ratings, maybe more pronounced in markets or chain-scale segments where service levels might be constrained by labor availabilities?\nTony Capuano: Of course. Obviously, we're early in the year, but maybe a good indication that addresses your question as we gear up for President's Day weekend here at the end of the week, this is a U.S. data, but the RevPAR numbers are pacing up about 12% ahead of where we were in '19 for Friday through Sunday. And to your specific question about pricing power, ADR is pacing up about 20% versus '19.\nJoe Greff : Great. And then a follow-up question on new development. Can you talk about the cadence of net rooms growth or net rooms growth rate this year? Is it even throughout the year? Is it more heavy in the second half? And lastly, how does the full service select service mix of net room development in '22 compare to that mix the last couple of years?\nTony Capuano: Of course. What I will tell you is pretty consistent for the last decade or more is our transactors, they are a big fourth quarter team. We tend to see a big pop in signings volume in the fourth quarter. But because our conversion volume was meaningfully higher in '21 versus history, when you have a deal like Sunwing, which I think was in the second quarter, that can impact the quarter-to-quarter numbers. But fourth quarter tends to be the biggest volume of signups.\nLeeny Oberg: And for openings, Joe, I think we definitely saw in Q4 of this year that you clearly saw a bunch of owners wanted to get ahead of this recovery that's moving forward. So we had a great fourth quarter. But we have traditionally been fairly steady unless there is a certain group of hotels that have all kind of come on at the same time. So I would say we've always tended to have some quarter-to-quarter variations, but that should march forward fairly squarely throughout the quarters on the opening side. I guess the only other thing to point out is just a reminder that construction for a limited-service hotel takes, broadly speaking, 2 years, and full service takes longer. So as you start to think about 2020 and recognize that as you get into Q3 of 2020, you were in the depths of the pandemic and starting to really see the impact on construction starts. That will start to obviously then have an impact as you go into '22.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Thomas Allen with JPMorgan -- I'm sorry, from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: So your non-RevPAR fees have been really encouraging. And Leeny, thanks for the commentary that you expect growth in 2022. Can you just give us a little bit more color there? I think I calculated that your 2021 non-RevPAR fees are about 15% above 2019 levels. What's giving you the confidence that, that should continue to grow?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So first of all, thanks very much. Just as a reminder that our credit card fees make up roughly 2/3 of our non-RevPAR-related fees. And so obviously, that's a big driver. They ended up, up 4% over 2019 levels for the full year in '21. And that was with really quite a weak Q1 as we were still in the heaviest part of the pandemic. So as we continue to see great card acquisitions and credit card average spend, I think we feel very good about those. I think residential branding fees, that business has been doing extremely well. And we expect to continue to see strong openings of those, which is when we get the fees. And then we continue to have application and relicensing fees as obviously, our business continues to grow on the franchise side. So we feel quite confident in the growth of that fee stream based on a continued strong economy.\nThomas Allen: And just a follow up, Leeny, not asking for 2023 guidance, but there is some -- when we think about starts, right, like there is some impact from openings and close -- sorry, there is some impact with starts not only the [non] but for residential branding fees, for example. Does that look like it's going to continue to grow as you go past 2022?\nLeeny Oberg: No, that's a good reminder, actually, Thomas, to remember that while we do get annual management fees, that is the smaller part of the fee stream that we get from residential. And those are overwhelmingly one-time fees that we get when the unit is ready for occupancy. So in that regard, even in '22, I would expect our fees to be a little bit lower than they were in '21 because in '21, it was -- we just had so many sales in residential. So I expect them to be a bit lower, although still meaningfully higher than our traditional levels of residential branding fees. And yes, you're right, they're lumpy because you can have 1 unit of 100 units goes into sales and closes literally within a quarter or 2, and then another one might not happen for 2 more quarters. So it is likely to be lumpy. And again, overall, we're really pleased with new signings that we're getting in the residential branded business. So I think you'll continue to see that business grow very nicely.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Great. Tony, I have a question and a follow-up question. Tony, my first question, a high-level question. Last year, in March and April, we certainly saw a very large acceleration in U.S. leisure demand. And what that means is we certainly have a very tough comp for U.S. leisure demand coming up. As far as your intuition, Tony, do you think U.S. leisure demand once we hit those tough comps in April onwards could actually eclipse last year's very strong levels? Just curious what you think about that.\nTony Capuano: Of course. Thanks, Patrick. Well, we continue to be really optimistic that there's still a significant tailwind for leisure demand. And I think part of that is because of the evolution of the way folks work. The incremental flexibility that you're seeing in working from home, working from anywhere has been an accelerant for leisure demand. And if anything, we expect further acceleration in that regard. And then when we look at our forward bookings, we already have more leisure on the books for months further out than we did in the same months last year. So we continue to be quite bullish on accelerated growth in leisure. And remember, leisure was already growing much more rapidly than business transient even pre-pandemic. And maybe the last part of my answer would be you heard Leeny talk a little bit about how modest cross-border travel has been. We've really only seen domestic leisure travel. And as more and more borders open, we think that influx of international leisure travel will also serve to accelerate the pace of leisure demand growth.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. That's definitely encouraging and good points on the international. Shifting gears on my follow-up question here. Certainly, it's been tough sledding for the hotel industry in China due to the 0 COVID policy. With RevPAR really still significantly down in China, have you seen that any impact on your pipeline given how much the -- in China, given how much the industry is struggling in China?\nTony Capuano: That's a good question, but thankfully, the answer is no. We continue to see really strong momentum, both on the signings and the openings front. And I think in many ways, our owners and partners in China are the mirror image of our owners and partners in other areas of the world. They don't try to time the market for the next quarter or 2. They tend to be long-term investors. Many of the projects that are getting done are parts of larger mixed-use projects. And the hotel components, in some ways, define those projects, so they are critically important. So we've not seen any sort of meaningful slum down, quite the contrary. We continue to see really strong demand for our brands from a development perspective across China.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Good to hear.\nLeeny Oberg: Just one quick follow-up for you on that. When you look at how many rooms we've currently got in Greater China, it's around 140,000. And our pipeline is only about 20% to 25% less than that for the pipeline for Greater China. So it's really -- you're looking at doubling that business potentially in not too long.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citigroup.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to just circle back on your commentary around conversion activity, which I think you said was about 18,000 rooms in '21. And I know you had said that you think it will continue to be strong. But can you maybe just -- do you think it can surpass what you saw in '21? And maybe you can talk a little bit about where you're seeing the conversions coming from on a regional basis? Is it mostly U.S.?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So I will remind you that one of the most significant contributors to our conversion volume in '21 was the conversion of about 7,000 all-inclusive rooms in the Caribbean with Sunwing. And I raised that not to apologize. Those sorts of large portfolio conversion opportunities are a meaningful part of our strategy and something that we'll continue to look for. But in terms of baseline conversions, we are seeing elevated interest from the owner and franchise community for our brands. And so we expect to see really strong volume continuing into 2022 and beyond. And as we talk with our owners and franchisees, not only do they like the flexibility of some of our soft brands, they like the fact that we've got conversion-friendly platforms across multiple chain scales. And they are focused not just on the ability of the company's revenue engines to drive top line revenue, but also some of the margin efficiencies that result from affiliation with our brands.\nLeeny Oberg: And Smedes, just as a reminder, 27% of our signings in 2021 were for conversions. One of the things that's been really gratifying to see is a number of owners who want to do a conversion, but with meaningful investment in the property.\nTony Capuano: Yes, I think that's a great point.\nLeeny Oberg: They may take 12 months to actually get open, but they're turning it into a beautiful representation of one of our brands and putting meaningful investment in it. So whether it opens specifically in '22 or '23, it's all going to be great for our guests and frankly, for our associates and for the owners.\nTony Capuano: And that 27%, Smedes, was about 10 percentage points higher than what we saw in the signings in '20 and in '19.\nSmedes Rose: Great. And then I just wanted to ask you when we were out at Atlas meeting, we met with a lot of owners. And there continues to be a lot of discussion, as you guys have commented on as well, of helping to reduce their costs being affiliated with large brands. And I'm just wondering, do you think there's a lot more to go there? Or do you feel like you're sort of streamlining and brand standards are changing sort of customer expectations is kind of reset now? Or how is that sort of relationship sort of panning out? I mean, we heard frankly, like just a broad range of commentary. Wondering how you're seeing it from your side.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So I think, first of all, I think the partnership during the pandemic between us and our owners and franchisees have never been better in terms of trying to manage these dramatically lower occupancy levels. And as I said in my comments, I think there is quite a bit of the savings that we put into place that is permanent, that will mean kind of significantly lower costs and significantly better productivity as we move forward. Now as you know, we've got the reality that for more complex hotels, they're -- it's a much higher percentage of costs that are labor-related. And we're obviously seeing a lot of pressure on that side, just like every other industry in the U.S. So there, we are -- we will continue to find ways to try to improve the margins. Rising occupancy, obviously, always ultimately helps you when you're spreading costs at a hotel. But it also means you've also got to make sure to have enough people there to deliver the service that our guests expect, and we are committed to making sure that we deliver those experiences that bring them back to our hotels over and over. And then the last thing I'll mention is just the great part about our business is we do reprice our rooms every day. And so when you think about what's been going on with our ADR, that has been a fabulous mitigation of what's been going on the labor cost side. So we will certainly continue to find new ways, but we are determined to make sure to deliver what our customers want.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Just a question for you on loyalty and your top customers. Maybe help us understand how are they spending today versus pre-pandemic levels? And then when you think about the lifetime value of that, say, top-tier platinum customer, has your view changed on who that customer is, who that platinum customer is on a go-forward basis?\nLeeny Oberg: Michael, sorry. You're breaking up. Can you start the question from the beginning?\nMichael Bellisario: Can you hear me better?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes.\nMichael Bellisario: Just a question for you on loyalty and your top-tier customers. How are they spending today? And where are they spending differently versus pre-pandemic levels? And then when you think about lifetime value, say, of a top-tier platinum customer, has your view changed on who that customer is going forward, given the changes in travel patterns today?\nTony Capuano: Okay. I said -- Mike, I apologize. You were breaking up a little bit. I think I heard your question. I think maybe our penetration rates, especially in the U.S. or maybe the best indication. We were back to 57% penetration in the fourth quarter, which is almost back to where we were pre-pandemic. So we're quite encouraged about the penetration rates, the passion and the enthusiasm we see within the Bonvoy base and as you heard in my prepared remarks, the pace at which the program continues to grow. And I think one of the really exciting things for us was as our credit card platforms continue to grow, they really gave us a unique opportunity to stay engaged with those most valuable Bonvoy customers even when they had hit the pause button on the volume of travel they experienced prior to the start of the pandemic.\nLeeny Oberg: And just to add fuel to Tony's fire, I'll mention 2 things. Number one, we have started doing credit card programs in other countries and found them to be really well received by the customers and seeing nice card acquisitions on that front. And then also just when you think about the growth in our digital share, and that is very much tied to the Bonvoy platform. And when you look at our digital share compared to '19, the share of reservations has gone up almost 500 basis points on our digital channel. And overall, we've grown up 300 basis points in our direct channels up to 76%. So I think that all ties very well into the power of Bonvoy.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Just first, just following up from some of the questions you've had already on inflation and particularly with regard to your incentive fees and the owned and leased portfolio profitability. If we get a full RevPAR recovery kind of into 2023, is that enough to get the incentive fees back to pre-pandemic levels? Or what's the dynamics that will kind of keep us away from that? And then a similar question on the owned and leased profitability. Is inflation going to hold back the recovery there?\nLeeny Oberg: Right. So a couple of things. You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of -- in '21, to your point about inflation. At the same time, one of the things I think is what's been so impressive about the operating teams is we used to think about breakeven levels for a full-service hotel of 40% to 50% occupancy. And what you're finding is that with the great work that they've done on managing the hotel and dramatically lower occupancies that they've been able to return these hotels to either neutral profitability at dramatically lower levels of breakeven occupancy. And so I think that will really help offset on the inflation side. The other comment I'll make is on the incentive fee side is just a reminder that it depends a whole lot on where. So just when you think broadly speaking, we were at almost 72% of our hotels were earning IMF in 2019, and we're now still a tad under 50%. And where you see the biggest difference is really domestically in the U.S. And that is that with owners' priorities, that is going to mean you really need to get back to those hurdles of levels of actual real profits before we're going to get our incentive fees. Now internationally, no surprise, where you've got quite a bit more of hotels without the owner's priority. There, you're already seeing dramatically higher percentages of hotels earning IMF. So I think we've got some great potential in the international hotels where there have been such restrictions on entering the country, and they're more dependent on international travelers. I think of Asia Pacific outside of China as an example there. And in the U.S., I think as you heard me say in our comments, the IMF that we're getting from the resorts have just been fantastic and in many cases, are already above 2019 levels. So when you think about the large cities in the U.S. and their greater relative dependence on international travel, I think it delivers a lot of confidence that we will get back. I just think predicting whether that is '23 or not is probably a bridge too far, but certainly moving in the right direction.\nRichard Clarke: And just as a follow-up. Last year, you talked about trying to cut some of the kind of cost reimbursement fees for the underlying hotels to help out their profitability. In Q4, it looks like that cost reimbursement revenue is about 85% of 2019 level. So it's recovered basically in line with your other fees. So just where are we in that process of sort of lowering that sort of reimbursement contribution from the owners?\nLeeny Oberg: So a couple things. One is a reminder that 85% of our reimbursed costs are based on the top line revenues of the hotels. So an overwhelming part, like, for example, our sales and marketing fees are contractually set at a percentage of revenues of the hotels. So they are, by nature, going to move up and down. The other thing is to recognize that we worked very hard on certain parts of the fees where we were able to impact kind of the fixed and floating component. And so that we do believe that there is more efficiency as we grow larger in terms of what we can do for the hotels. And as an example, when you're a digital share, your direct share of reservations is growing as well as it is. It's just a reminder that those are some of the lowest cost reservations for a hotel as possible. But we did lower our fixed cost by roughly 30% for the system. But as I said before, overwhelmingly, the charges are based on a function of hotel revenues.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.\nVince Ciepiel: You spoke about delivering the service that the guests expect and when I hear that, I think about food and beverage, I think about housekeeping. I'm curious kind of what percent of the way back you are as it relates to your breakfast buffets and select service hotels, your 3-meal-a-day restaurants and more full service? And can you remind us what percentage of guests are kind of -- are you on the opt-in model? And what percentage of guests are opting in for housekeeping?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So on housekeeping, we continue to evolve our approach. Today, in our select tier hotels, it is an opt-in approach. Daily housekeeping is available at the discretion of the guest. And at luxury, we are doing daily housekeeping. We're testing those options today. We're using those learnings to try and strike the right balance between guest expectations and economic realities for the owners. And as we work through those tests, we intend to launch a definitive approach sometime here early in 2022.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. And how about on the food and beverage side? What percentage of the way back are you there?\nTony Capuano: Yes, we're here. So we're getting there. It's -- we are largely back to where we were in the markets that have seen the most rapid recovery. So if you are lucky enough to visit our hotels, particularly in resort destinations, you'll experience food and beverage services and offerings very similar to what you saw pre-pandemic. An example of that, we just had our Board meeting down in South Florida. Most of us had to order in-room dining because the restaurants couldn't offer us reservations prior to 10:45 p.m., and they were full. In those markets where we've seen demand recover more slowly, we are moderating the pace at which we bring back our food and beverage offerings and trying to have that pace match the pace of demand recovery.\nVince Ciepiel: That makes a lot of sense. My second question is on distribution. With special corporate being down, I imagine OTA contribution is up. But can you just remind us, I think pre-pandemic, I think you were in the low double digits for OTA contribution. What did that end up being in 2021? And then I think your digital direct channel was growing pretty fast, maybe even faster than OTA. How has that evolved? And where do you see that going in 2022?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So I think a couple things. And that's just a reminder that in 2019, you also had -- special corporate is classically done through what we call GDS. And that is what is obviously taking the biggest dip. So now when you look at kind of their percentage share, they're down 600 basis points as compared to '19. Now the OTAs are up with all this leisure business by 200 basis points, and they're at 14% in 2021. But at the same time, a direct share of total room nights is up to 76.3%, and that's actually up 340 basis points. So actually, our direct channels have grown meaningfully more than the OTAs. The OTAs have clearly obviously benefited from the leisure business. And GDS classically and more related to business travel has been the one that has lost the most share. And the only other thing that I'll mention because I just find it interesting that also within the direct share growth is the movement off of voice to digital. And I think that all makes sense when you think about our Bonvoy technology and our app and how many downloads we get that our guests are feeling more and more comfortable using the digital channel, which, again, is an incredibly efficient channel from a cost perspective and from a value delivery to the customer.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Just on the development pipeline and as I think about supply chain delays and the like, maybe help us understand, if we go back to the beginning of 2021, what your outlook was for the room\u2019s growth at that time? How many of those projects got delayed versus your original outlook and maybe pushed into 2022? And then likewise, what sort of cushion do you get to the 2022 forecast as you think about ongoing delays and so forth?\nTony Capuano: Yes, I'll take a try at that one, and Leeny may chime in. I think about it a little bit -- I think about the pipeline a little like a conveyor belt. We've got some projects, one of the reasons that our openings were so strong in the fourth quarter is we saw some projects that in our earlier forecast, we assumed would open Q1 '22. And they actually got done a little more quickly and opened in December. We do see some delays that come out the back end. But I think maybe the most relevant statistics are the pace at which shovels are going in the ground and the lengthening we've seen in the construction cycle. You heard Leeny in her remarks talk about roughly 24 months start to finish as an average for our select service hotels here in the U.S. There's not a lot we can do to accelerate that. If anything, we've got some challenges with supply chain and the like. But that 24 months seems to be older. It's one of the reasons we continue to be so focused on conversions in the year for the year.\nLeeny Oberg: And as Tony said, we do -- for what it's worth, when we build our budget, we do go project by project, country by country. So it is a quite detailed estimate. But as Tony pointed out, there are some that finished a little bit earlier, and some that end up being a little bit later. And we do our best every year at estimating. But the other part that I'll point out when we talked about where we were at the beginning of '21 is that we actually expect the deletions to be higher. And I think you all will remember that my comments then reflected probably about 50 basis points of an expected COVID-related hedge that it was hard to predict at that point where exactly all these hotels would go as we move through the pandemic. And I think happily with a lot of work on everybody's part, including the owners in revenue management and on the cost side, that -- and the banks have been very good partners to work with as well. We have seen deletions come in better than we expected. And that has also ended up helping the net rooms growth number even compared to where we were 4 months ago.\nRich Hightower: That's really helpful color. And if I could just add one follow-up. Maybe back to, I think, one of your responses on the leisure side and thinking about demand and pricing power in that segment. If we look at some of the non-traditional short-term rental companies, for instance, Airbnb and so forth, everybody sort of talks about their leisure customer the same way. And a lot of this is the business has improved meaningfully with work from home and a hybrid workforce and all that kind of stuff. I mean, would you say that there's more or less or about the same customer overlap as you think about your core leisure customer versus what we see in the short-term rental space? And how has that changed over the course of COVID?\nTony Capuano: Well, I think if you look particularly at the performance we've seen in our luxury tier resorts and our full-service resorts, one of the things we hear from our customers pretty clearly is their desire for a full complement of services and amenities. And as we've said in response to versions of this question in the past, that's probably the most significant differentiator between our product offering and some of the short-term rental offerings that are out there.\nLeeny Oberg: The other thing I'll mention is clearly in the beginning of the pandemic when you were kind of imagining searches for people wanting to get away, there was larger proportion of searches that were for places that are out of the way, truly places where people felt comfortable going where they could be away from others. And we have seen that gap narrow in terms of the searches for kind of classic room-sharing type places as well as hotels. We've seen that gap narrow, which I think makes sense given the progress as we move through the pandemic.\nOperator: And we do have another question, and that will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: On the owned and leased segment, can you give us a little bit more color on some of the puts and takes that could impact that segment RevPAR and margin performance versus the system-wide trends in 2022? And maybe even tie in how you're thinking about any asset sales there, if possible, given how strong the transaction market has been?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. I think on the asset sales, we will obviously continue to be opportunistic, Stephen. And it really depends on where the hotel is both in terms of its stage of CapEx. As you know, in a number of hotels that we own, we really want to get them to be great representations of our brands. And in cases where the markets have really not recovered, we are not going to feel compelled to rush that sale. So in that regard, it will really vary. We've also got JV interest as you know. For example, our St. Regis Punta Mita JV was sold during 2021. That market was doing great. The hotel was in great shape, and we were able to get a really good sales price on that asset. So I think it really does depend a lot on the situation. Remember that owned lease also has termination fees, and that also I would expect not to be growing, but also to continue to provide somewhere in the ballpark of $40 million in fees a year. And then on the owned leased profit, I think you will continue to see progress. But do remember that we have a chunk of leased hotels. And there, you obviously need to get to where you're covering your fixed rent payment to the extent it is fixed rent, which will mean it behaves a little bit more like a U.S. owner's priority where you need to get to a floor before you're actually getting any profit. So I think we look forward to seeing the numbers get better and better. But in terms of getting back to the full levels of 2019, I think it will take a little bit of time.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. And perhaps as a big picture follow-up, Tony, now that we're coming up on the roughly 1-year mark that you've taken over as CEO, I'm curious how you could characterize where your thought priorities are now position the company, not only for this unique recovery, but longer term, and how they may have shifted over the course of the year, particularly given you've met with folks in the field more recently?\nTony Capuano: Sure. Thanks. I don't think they've shifted meaningfully. I mean, I think we are encouraged, as you've heard this morning, about the pace of demand recovery. But the priorities really continue to revolve around our key constituents, leading with our associates, certainly our guests and as we've discussed at length this morning, the economic health of our owners Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions this morning, for your continued interest in Marriott. And with increasing frequency, we look forward to seeing you on the road. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I wanted to take a moment and reflect on this day, which marks the 1-year anniversary of Arne's passing. I know everyone on this call, especially our Marriott associates, miss our dear friend, an inspirational leader, a great deal. We can take comfort knowing his amazing legacy lives on in the incredible work of the thousands of people around the world who wear a Marriott name badge. Let me turn the call back over to Jackie to get us underway in discussing this quarter's results. Thanks, Jackie. We're very pleased with the remarkable progress we made in 2021 across the entire global portfolio despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We finished the year on a real high note with the emergence of Omicron having a limited impact on results in the fourth quarter. In December, global ADR was 3% above 2019 levels, and occupancy for the month gained further ground compared to December of 2019, driving global RevPAR to an 11% decline versus 2019. This was a 53 percentage point improvement from the RevPAR decline in January of 2021. In the fourth quarter, global RevPAR was 19% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Global occupancy for the quarter came in at 58%, 12 percentage points below 2019, while ADR was only 2% shy of 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter RevPAR declined 15% compared to 2019. Results were driven by strong ADR, which was less than 2% below pre-pandemic levels. Further strengthening of already robust leisure travel and steady improvement in the recovery of business transient and group demand also helped results. Fourth quarter group room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was down 32% versus 2019, a 9%-point improvement from the third quarter decline. With booking windows still much shorter than usual, in the quarter for the quarter bookings were up 45% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Group cancellations ticked up late last year and early this year due to Omicron mostly for arrival dates in January and February, but those cancellations have slowed more recently. New group bookings have also been gaining momentum, especially in the year for the year. In fact, just last week, Salesforce held a large company meeting in New York City that was booked just 1 month before the event. It was the largest internal meeting Salesforce has held since the start of the pandemic with over 25,000 room nights across 11 of our properties. While special corporate demand in the U.S. and Canada was still well below '19 levels, there was gradual improvement in the fourth quarter. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, bookings in the quarter were down 33%, 11% -- excuse me, 11 percentage points better than the decline in the bookings in the third quarter. Weekly bookings around the end of last year were impacted by Omicron, but they have recovered since the trough in early January. All of our international regions, except for Greater China, posted sequential RevPAR recovery from the third to the fourth quarter as more borders reopened and travel restrictions eased. Greater China's fourth quarter 27% RevPAR decline compared to 2019 was in line with the decline in the third quarter as their zero COVID policy once again resulted in the lockdown of several cities. The Middle East and Africa or MEA region performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, really demonstrating the resilience of travel demand. With relatively high vaccination rates and low travel restrictions during the quarter, the Middle East has become a safe, easy place to visit. Led by strength in the UAE, fourth quarter RevPAR in MEA rose 8% in 2019 driven by 20% higher ADR -- excuse me, 8% above '19 driven by 20% higher ADR. Fourth quarter occupancy in MEA topped 65%, the highest of our regions. Leisure demand was remarkably strong, benefiting from a significant increase in international visitors. Room nights from international guests rose nearly 60% from the third to the fourth quarter. Throughout the pandemic, strengthening our valuable loyalty platform and engaging with our Marriott Bonvoy members have been key areas of focus. In the fourth quarter of '21, 52% of room nights globally and 58% of room nights in the U.S. and Canada were booked by Bonvoy members. And global membership grew to over 160 million members at year-end driven by strong digital sign-ups. Turning to development. Both room additions and signings were strong in '21 despite ongoing challenges associated with the pandemic. Despite industry-wide preconstruction and construction delays, some labor shortages and supply chain issues, we added a record 86,000 gross rooms and 517 properties leading to 6.1% gross rooms growth for the year. Our global net rooms growth was 3.9%, above our previous expectation, given deletions were towards the low end of those expectations. Our deletion rate for 2021 was 2.1% or 1.2% excluding the exit of 88 Service Properties Trust hotels. We are also pleased that we continue to grow our share of rooms globally. In 2021, around 15% of all global new build rooms opened under our brands compared to our year-end room share of 7%. This share is expected to continue as we had 18% of all global rooms under construction at the end of '21, more than twice our current share of open rooms. Our development team signed franchise and management agreements for approximately 92,000 rooms during 2021, and our year-end global pipeline totaled roughly 485,000 rooms. The composition of our pipeline dovetails nicely with current demand trends. Leisure demand has led to recovery, and we are well positioned to continue growing our lead in resort destinations, including in the high-growth, all-inclusive space. We've also been seeing strong preference for our luxury properties. With luxury rooms accounting for more than 10% of our pipeline, we are poised to further expand our industry-leading portfolio in this valuable high-fee segment. Conversions were a significant growth driver in 2021, accounting for 21% of room additions and 27% of signings. With the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of our system, we anticipate that conversions will remain an important contributor to growth over the next several years. For 2022, we expect gross rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely, 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. As a reminder, average construction time lines are currently around 2 years for limited service deals and often longer for full service deals. Yet given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our conversion momentum and our industry-leading pipeline, we are confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I did want to share a few highlights of the company's ESG efforts over the course of the year. The Board of Directors and our management team are keenly focused on these important areas as we're committed to making a positive and sustainable impact in the communities where we live and work. In June, as part of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, we announced we were setting new internal diversity goals for our group of Vice Presidents and above. The new targets aim to achieve global gender parity by 2023, an acceleration of our prior timetable and to increase representation of people of color in the U.S. to 25% by 2025. In July, we updated our human trafficking awareness training, which will be made widely available to the entire industry. More than 900,000 associates have now taken training in this area. And in September, we pledged to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with the 1.5-degree Celsius emissions scenarios. As I finish my first year as CEO, I want to again thank our incredible associates for all their hard work through these challenging times. I've spent most of the last few months on the road, traveling across the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles and also abroad and have seen firsthand their dedication to serving our guests. I'm so proud of all we've accomplished over the last year and continue to be very optimistic about our outlook for 2022 and beyond.  Leeny? Thanks, Shaun. Well, as we've said the last couple of quarters, the ripple effects of the pandemic create less visibility beyond '22 than we might like. With that said, I think you heard the momentum on signings in my prepared remarks. We continue to see good volume on the conversion front. In the short term, obviously, we've got a bit of challenges in terms of construction starts, particularly in the U.S. But in some ways, that causes us to think about it as a when, not an if. And in fact, one of the statistics we look at most closely is fallout from the pipeline. If we were seeing wholesale project cancellations, that might cause us to think differently about the medium to long term. But in fact, what we saw in 2021 was about 6.5% lower than our average fallout over the last decade. Yes. Thanks, Robin. And maybe I'll refresh some of the data that we shared with you last quarter. I'm going to give you some comparisons between at the end of '19, what we saw is definite bookings on the books for '20 and '21 and how that compares at the end of '21, what we see on the books for '22 and '23. So at the end of December of '21 as we looked at definite bookings for '22, we were down just a shade under 22% compared to end of '19 for '20. When we look at what's on the books for '23 at the end of 2021, we're down just a shade under 15% versus what we had on the books at the end of '19 for 2021. And so to your specific question, we are seeing steady and encouraging forward bookings in the group segment. And the other thing I would point out, Robin, you heard in my prepared remarks the comment about that big piece of Salesforce business that was booked just 1 month before. We expect to continue to see improvement from the levels I just described to you because we're seeing more short-term bookings, and that's been the trend over the last number of weeks and months. And Robin, let me just give you a little more granular information to try to address your question. This is a global number. But if you look at the global booking window, it really got the shortest in the second quarter of 2020, where it was down to 5 years. Excuse me, 5 days. If you look at fourth quarter of 2021, it had risen to about 17 days. So to Leeny's point, certainly not back to where we were pre-pandemic, but trending in the right direction. Of course. Obviously, we're early in the year, but maybe a good indication that addresses your question as we gear up for President's Day weekend here at the end of the week, this is a U.S. data, but the RevPAR numbers are pacing up about 12% ahead of where we were in '19 for Friday through Sunday. And to your specific question about pricing power, ADR is pacing up about 20% versus '19. Of course. What I will tell you is pretty consistent for the last decade or more is our transactors, they are a big fourth quarter team. We tend to see a big pop in signings volume in the fourth quarter. But because our conversion volume was meaningfully higher in '21 versus history, when you have a deal like Sunwing, which I think was in the second quarter, that can impact the quarter-to-quarter numbers. But fourth quarter tends to be the biggest volume of signups. Of course. Thanks, Patrick. Well, we continue to be really optimistic that there's still a significant tailwind for leisure demand. And I think part of that is because of the evolution of the way folks work. The incremental flexibility that you're seeing in working from home, working from anywhere has been an accelerant for leisure demand. And if anything, we expect further acceleration in that regard. And then when we look at our forward bookings, we already have more leisure on the books for months further out than we did in the same months last year. So we continue to be quite bullish on accelerated growth in leisure. And remember, leisure was already growing much more rapidly than business transient even pre-pandemic. And maybe the last part of my answer would be you heard Leeny talk a little bit about how modest cross-border travel has been. We've really only seen domestic leisure travel. And as more and more borders open, we think that influx of international leisure travel will also serve to accelerate the pace of leisure demand growth. That's a good question, but thankfully, the answer is no. We continue to see really strong momentum, both on the signings and the openings front. And I think in many ways, our owners and partners in China are the mirror image of our owners and partners in other areas of the world. They don't try to time the market for the next quarter or 2. They tend to be long-term investors. Many of the projects that are getting done are parts of larger mixed-use projects. And the hotel components, in some ways, define those projects, so they are critically important. So we've not seen any sort of meaningful slum down, quite the contrary. We continue to see really strong demand for our brands from a development perspective across China. Sure. So I will remind you that one of the most significant contributors to our conversion volume in '21 was the conversion of about 7,000 all-inclusive rooms in the Caribbean with Sunwing. And I raised that not to apologize. Those sorts of large portfolio conversion opportunities are a meaningful part of our strategy and something that we'll continue to look for. But in terms of baseline conversions, we are seeing elevated interest from the owner and franchise community for our brands. And so we expect to see really strong volume continuing into 2022 and beyond. And as we talk with our owners and franchisees, not only do they like the flexibility of some of our soft brands, they like the fact that we've got conversion-friendly platforms across multiple chain scales. And they are focused not just on the ability of the company's revenue engines to drive top line revenue, but also some of the margin efficiencies that result from affiliation with our brands. Yes, I think that's a great point. And that 27%, Smedes, was about 10 percentage points higher than what we saw in the signings in '20 and in '19. Okay. I said -- Mike, I apologize. You were breaking up a little bit. I think I heard your question. I think maybe our penetration rates, especially in the U.S. or maybe the best indication. We were back to 57% penetration in the fourth quarter, which is almost back to where we were pre-pandemic. So we're quite encouraged about the penetration rates, the passion and the enthusiasm we see within the Bonvoy base and as you heard in my prepared remarks, the pace at which the program continues to grow. And I think one of the really exciting things for us was as our credit card platforms continue to grow, they really gave us a unique opportunity to stay engaged with those most valuable Bonvoy customers even when they had hit the pause button on the volume of travel they experienced prior to the start of the pandemic. Sure. So on housekeeping, we continue to evolve our approach. Today, in our select tier hotels, it is an opt-in approach. Daily housekeeping is available at the discretion of the guest. And at luxury, we are doing daily housekeeping. We're testing those options today. We're using those learnings to try and strike the right balance between guest expectations and economic realities for the owners. And as we work through those tests, we intend to launch a definitive approach sometime here early in 2022. Yes, we're here. So we're getting there. It's -- we are largely back to where we were in the markets that have seen the most rapid recovery. So if you are lucky enough to visit our hotels, particularly in resort destinations, you'll experience food and beverage services and offerings very similar to what you saw pre-pandemic. An example of that, we just had our Board meeting down in South Florida. Most of us had to order in-room dining because the restaurants couldn't offer us reservations prior to 10:45 p.m., and they were full. In those markets where we've seen demand recover more slowly, we are moderating the pace at which we bring back our food and beverage offerings and trying to have that pace match the pace of demand recovery. Yes, I'll take a try at that one, and Leeny may chime in. I think about it a little bit -- I think about the pipeline a little like a conveyor belt. We've got some projects, one of the reasons that our openings were so strong in the fourth quarter is we saw some projects that in our earlier forecast, we assumed would open Q1 '22. And they actually got done a little more quickly and opened in December. We do see some delays that come out the back end. But I think maybe the most relevant statistics are the pace at which shovels are going in the ground and the lengthening we've seen in the construction cycle. You heard Leeny in her remarks talk about roughly 24 months start to finish as an average for our select service hotels here in the U.S. There's not a lot we can do to accelerate that. If anything, we've got some challenges with supply chain and the like. But that 24 months seems to be older. It's one of the reasons we continue to be so focused on conversions in the year for the year. Well, I think if you look particularly at the performance we've seen in our luxury tier resorts and our full-service resorts, one of the things we hear from our customers pretty clearly is their desire for a full complement of services and amenities. And as we've said in response to versions of this question in the past, that's probably the most significant differentiator between our product offering and some of the short-term rental offerings that are out there. Sure. Thanks. I don't think they've shifted meaningfully. I mean, I think we are encouraged, as you've heard this morning, about the pace of demand recovery. But the priorities really continue to revolve around our key constituents, leading with our associates, certainly our guests and as we've discussed at length this morning, the economic health of our owners Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions this morning, for your continued interest in Marriott. And with increasing frequency, we look forward to seeing you on the road. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our fourth quarter results reflect the clear resilience of travel, our strong focus on cost containment and the benefits of our asset-light business model. Gross fee revenues reached $831 million in the fourth quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $186 million in the fourth quarter 19% ahead of 2019 levels driven by robust global card spending and new account acquisitions as well as outstanding performance in our branded residential business. Incentive management fees, or IMF, totaled $94 million in the quarter. Just under half of these fees were earned at resort properties with IMF from our comparable luxury resorts up almost 45% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our owned and leased portfolio generated $19 million of profits, a nice increase from a loss of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 as results improved at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Our operating teams have done extraordinary work to adapt quickly and return these hotels to breakeven profitability or better despite continued lower-than-normal occupancy levels. G&A and other expense totaled $213 million in the fourth quarter, higher than prior expectations as a result of higher compensation costs, including true-ups and higher legal expenses. For full year 2021, G&A and other came in at $823 million, 12% lower than full year 2019, reflecting ongoing savings resulting from our significant restructuring activities in 2020. At the hotel level, we have partnered with our owners and franchisees throughout the pandemic, working diligently to lower costs, bring down breakeven occupancy levels and drive cash flow. With the recovery well underway, we're committed to delivering consistent and positive guest experiences while keeping hotel operating costs down. Many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we put into place will be maintained as occupancies rebound. While the labor environment is slowly improving, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation. We're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As always, we are also carefully managing cash outlays at the corporate level. We were pleased with our cash flow generation during 2021 and with our year-end liquidity position of over $4.8 billion, which covers near-term debt maturities with significant cushion. Our full year cash flows from the loyalty program were positive before considering the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which effectively repaid around 1/3 of the total $920 million we received in 2020, loyalty cash flows were modestly negative. Looking ahead to 2022, there is still too much uncertainty and volatility to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again share some general observations and provide color on certain specific items where we do have some visibility. I'll start with some thoughts on the first quarter of 2022. Omicron meaningfully impacted global group and business transient demand in January, historically the lowest occupancy month of the year. While we saw minimal disruption to leisure travel, global RevPAR for the month declined 31% compared to January of '19 primarily due to lower occupancy as rate was just 4% below 2019. We expect to see the recovery pace pick up nicely in February and March given weekly bookings across customer segments have now returned to pre-Omicron levels. However, with some countries reinstituting strict travel restrictions earlier this year, we could see first quarter 2022 RevPAR compared to '19 levels take a step back from the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of '21 versus 2019. We then expect significant forward progression in the global recovery each quarter through the end of the year. Following the temporary Delta-related slowdown during the third quarter of last year, demand picked up meaningfully through the end of last year. That bolsters our optimism that by the end of the year, the 2022 fourth quarter gap to 2019 fourth quarter RevPAR will narrow meaningfully compared to the 19% decline in the fourth quarter of 2021. As additional markets reopen and more employees return to the office, we expect robust ADR, sustained strong leisure transient demand and significant improvement in business transient and group. We also expect to see growth in trips that blend business and leisure. International travelers getting back on the road should also drive further improvement in RevPAR. In 2019, nearly 20% of global room nights were from cross-border guests. So far, most global demand during the pandemic has come from domestic visitors. Cross-border room nights in 2021 were down more than 60% compared to 2019 while domestic room nights were down 16% over the same time period. Our fourth quarter performance in the Middle East illustrates how impactful the return of international travel can be. We're encouraged by the swift pickup in booking activity that we've seen in the last few weeks in places that are opening up, such as Thailand and the Cayman Islands. Turning to fees. At current RevPAR levels, we expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year '22 RevPAR versus full year '21 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. This sensitivity is no longer compared to 2019 as the compounding impact from new rooms growth contributions makes the comparison less relevant 3 years out. In 2022, we expect continued growth from our non-RevPAR-related fees driven by higher contributions from credit card fees. We also anticipate profit growth from our owned and leased portfolio as the global environment improves. For the full year, interest expense net is anticipated to be roughly $350 million, and our core tax rate is expected to be around 23%. G&A and other expenses could total $860 million to $880 million, still well below 2019 levels but higher on a year-over-year basis primarily due to higher compensation costs and assumed higher travel expenses. As always, driving cash flow will be a priority in 2022. We anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We expect cash flows from loyalty to be slightly positive in 2022 before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. We made great progress in improving our credit ratios during 2021 and remain focused on bringing our leverage in line with our target of 3 to 3.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. Assuming the recovery continues largely as anticipated, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We would likely begin by paying a dividend with a payout ratio a bit below our traditional 30%. We can then see more meaningful levels of capital returns, including share repurchases, along with dividends in 2023 and beyond. Over the last 2 years, our business has been tested in ways we never could have imagined. We're incredibly proud of how our teams have adapted and how well our company has performed. We made significant progress in 2021 and are excited about continued recovery and our growth opportunities ahead. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? So thanks very much. And it is interesting. When you look at December, for example, the U.S. and Canada in the month of December was really -- was down only 6 percentage points compared to 2019. So it is absolutely the case that you could see depending on the mix of business and exactly how countries open up and kind of the classic occupancy from a seasonal pattern standpoint. I could imagine that it's possible that you have that happen, Shaun. I think though, so much of this really depends on the global picture in terms of the pace of the recovery. So you need lots of things happening on all the points of business, not just leisure but also special corporate as well as group to see us get to that delightful place. But at the same time, I think we feel great about the momentum. The other comment I'll make is when you see countries open up their restrictions, the kind of jolt that our reservation centers feel is impressive. And I do think that momentum gives us confidence that we could see this resilience continue to build. Just to add one point, Robin, when you look at Q1, understandably, with Omicron, clearly, you're looking at a weaker group picture than you are as you get into Q3, which is meaningfully better. So your point is well taken that it should move as we go through the year. And I think the other part that is just fantastic is that rate both in '22 and '23 already from what's on the books is up 3% to 4%. So the booking window has extended, but it is not the way it was back in 2019. So it's improved, but it is still the case that we're not back to where we are. And I think, clearly, in Q1, Robin, January is a great example where you saw special corporate particularly weaker with what was going on with Omicron. So I think part of this, you're going to see it get -- see more visibility as we get further and further into the year. But it is a bit better than it was in 2020. 5 days. And for openings, Joe, I think we definitely saw in Q4 of this year that you clearly saw a bunch of owners wanted to get ahead of this recovery that's moving forward. So we had a great fourth quarter. But we have traditionally been fairly steady unless there is a certain group of hotels that have all kind of come on at the same time. So I would say we've always tended to have some quarter-to-quarter variations, but that should march forward fairly squarely throughout the quarters on the opening side. I guess the only other thing to point out is just a reminder that construction for a limited-service hotel takes, broadly speaking, 2 years, and full service takes longer. So as you start to think about 2020 and recognize that as you get into Q3 of 2020, you were in the depths of the pandemic and starting to really see the impact on construction starts. That will start to obviously then have an impact as you go into '22. Yes. So first of all, thanks very much. Just as a reminder that our credit card fees make up roughly 2/3 of our non-RevPAR-related fees. And so obviously, that's a big driver. They ended up, up 4% over 2019 levels for the full year in '21. And that was with really quite a weak Q1 as we were still in the heaviest part of the pandemic. So as we continue to see great card acquisitions and credit card average spend, I think we feel very good about those. I think residential branding fees, that business has been doing extremely well. And we expect to continue to see strong openings of those, which is when we get the fees. And then we continue to have application and relicensing fees as obviously, our business continues to grow on the franchise side. So we feel quite confident in the growth of that fee stream based on a continued strong economy. No, that's a good reminder, actually, Thomas, to remember that while we do get annual management fees, that is the smaller part of the fee stream that we get from residential. And those are overwhelmingly one-time fees that we get when the unit is ready for occupancy. So in that regard, even in '22, I would expect our fees to be a little bit lower than they were in '21 because in '21, it was -- we just had so many sales in residential. So I expect them to be a bit lower, although still meaningfully higher than our traditional levels of residential branding fees. And yes, you're right, they're lumpy because you can have 1 unit of 100 units goes into sales and closes literally within a quarter or 2, and then another one might not happen for 2 more quarters. So it is likely to be lumpy. And again, overall, we're really pleased with new signings that we're getting in the residential branded business. So I think you'll continue to see that business grow very nicely. Just one quick follow-up for you on that. When you look at how many rooms we've currently got in Greater China, it's around 140,000. And our pipeline is only about 20% to 25% less than that for the pipeline for Greater China. So it's really -- you're looking at doubling that business potentially in not too long. And Smedes, just as a reminder, 27% of our signings in 2021 were for conversions. One of the things that's been really gratifying to see is a number of owners who want to do a conversion, but with meaningful investment in the property. They may take 12 months to actually get open, but they're turning it into a beautiful representation of one of our brands and putting meaningful investment in it. So whether it opens specifically in '22 or '23, it's all going to be great for our guests and frankly, for our associates and for the owners. Sure. So I think, first of all, I think the partnership during the pandemic between us and our owners and franchisees have never been better in terms of trying to manage these dramatically lower occupancy levels. And as I said in my comments, I think there is quite a bit of the savings that we put into place that is permanent, that will mean kind of significantly lower costs and significantly better productivity as we move forward. Now as you know, we've got the reality that for more complex hotels, they're -- it's a much higher percentage of costs that are labor-related. And we're obviously seeing a lot of pressure on that side, just like every other industry in the U.S. So there, we are -- we will continue to find ways to try to improve the margins. Rising occupancy, obviously, always ultimately helps you when you're spreading costs at a hotel. But it also means you've also got to make sure to have enough people there to deliver the service that our guests expect, and we are committed to making sure that we deliver those experiences that bring them back to our hotels over and over. And then the last thing I'll mention is just the great part about our business is we do reprice our rooms every day. And so when you think about what's been going on with our ADR, that has been a fabulous mitigation of what's been going on the labor cost side. So we will certainly continue to find new ways, but we are determined to make sure to deliver what our customers want. Michael, sorry. You're breaking up. Can you start the question from the beginning? Yes. And just to add fuel to Tony's fire, I'll mention 2 things. Number one, we have started doing credit card programs in other countries and found them to be really well received by the customers and seeing nice card acquisitions on that front. And then also just when you think about the growth in our digital share, and that is very much tied to the Bonvoy platform. And when you look at our digital share compared to '19, the share of reservations has gone up almost 500 basis points on our digital channel. And overall, we've grown up 300 basis points in our direct channels up to 76%. So I think that all ties very well into the power of Bonvoy. Right. So a couple of things. You are right to point out that nominal level of RevPAR is not the same as real. And so when we think about it, for example, now, the real recovery of RevPAR is about 3 points worse relative to the nominal just because of -- in '21, to your point about inflation. At the same time, one of the things I think is what's been so impressive about the operating teams is we used to think about breakeven levels for a full-service hotel of 40% to 50% occupancy. And what you're finding is that with the great work that they've done on managing the hotel and dramatically lower occupancies that they've been able to return these hotels to either neutral profitability at dramatically lower levels of breakeven occupancy. And so I think that will really help offset on the inflation side. The other comment I'll make is on the incentive fee side is just a reminder that it depends a whole lot on where. So just when you think broadly speaking, we were at almost 72% of our hotels were earning IMF in 2019, and we're now still a tad under 50%. And where you see the biggest difference is really domestically in the U.S. And that is that with owners' priorities, that is going to mean you really need to get back to those hurdles of levels of actual real profits before we're going to get our incentive fees. Now internationally, no surprise, where you've got quite a bit more of hotels without the owner's priority. There, you're already seeing dramatically higher percentages of hotels earning IMF. So I think we've got some great potential in the international hotels where there have been such restrictions on entering the country, and they're more dependent on international travelers. I think of Asia Pacific outside of China as an example there. And in the U.S., I think as you heard me say in our comments, the IMF that we're getting from the resorts have just been fantastic and in many cases, are already above 2019 levels. So when you think about the large cities in the U.S. and their greater relative dependence on international travel, I think it delivers a lot of confidence that we will get back. I just think predicting whether that is '23 or not is probably a bridge too far, but certainly moving in the right direction. So a couple things. One is a reminder that 85% of our reimbursed costs are based on the top line revenues of the hotels. So an overwhelming part, like, for example, our sales and marketing fees are contractually set at a percentage of revenues of the hotels. So they are, by nature, going to move up and down. The other thing is to recognize that we worked very hard on certain parts of the fees where we were able to impact kind of the fixed and floating component. And so that we do believe that there is more efficiency as we grow larger in terms of what we can do for the hotels. And as an example, when you're a digital share, your direct share of reservations is growing as well as it is. It's just a reminder that those are some of the lowest cost reservations for a hotel as possible. But we did lower our fixed cost by roughly 30% for the system. But as I said before, overwhelmingly, the charges are based on a function of hotel revenues. Sure. So I think a couple things. And that's just a reminder that in 2019, you also had -- special corporate is classically done through what we call GDS. And that is what is obviously taking the biggest dip. So now when you look at kind of their percentage share, they're down 600 basis points as compared to '19. Now the OTAs are up with all this leisure business by 200 basis points, and they're at 14% in 2021. But at the same time, a direct share of total room nights is up to 76.3%, and that's actually up 340 basis points. So actually, our direct channels have grown meaningfully more than the OTAs. The OTAs have clearly obviously benefited from the leisure business. And GDS classically and more related to business travel has been the one that has lost the most share. And the only other thing that I'll mention because I just find it interesting that also within the direct share growth is the movement off of voice to digital. And I think that all makes sense when you think about our Bonvoy technology and our app and how many downloads we get that our guests are feeling more and more comfortable using the digital channel, which, again, is an incredibly efficient channel from a cost perspective and from a value delivery to the customer. And as Tony said, we do -- for what it's worth, when we build our budget, we do go project by project, country by country. So it is a quite detailed estimate. But as Tony pointed out, there are some that finished a little bit earlier, and some that end up being a little bit later. And we do our best every year at estimating. But the other part that I'll point out when we talked about where we were at the beginning of '21 is that we actually expect the deletions to be higher. And I think you all will remember that my comments then reflected probably about 50 basis points of an expected COVID-related hedge that it was hard to predict at that point where exactly all these hotels would go as we move through the pandemic. And I think happily with a lot of work on everybody's part, including the owners in revenue management and on the cost side, that -- and the banks have been very good partners to work with as well. We have seen deletions come in better than we expected. And that has also ended up helping the net rooms growth number even compared to where we were 4 months ago. The other thing I'll mention is clearly in the beginning of the pandemic when you were kind of imagining searches for people wanting to get away, there was larger proportion of searches that were for places that are out of the way, truly places where people felt comfortable going where they could be away from others. And we have seen that gap narrow in terms of the searches for kind of classic room-sharing type places as well as hotels. We've seen that gap narrow, which I think makes sense given the progress as we move through the pandemic. Sure. I think on the asset sales, we will obviously continue to be opportunistic, Stephen. And it really depends on where the hotel is both in terms of its stage of CapEx. As you know, in a number of hotels that we own, we really want to get them to be great representations of our brands. And in cases where the markets have really not recovered, we are not going to feel compelled to rush that sale. So in that regard, it will really vary. We've also got JV interest as you know. For example, our St. Regis Punta Mita JV was sold during 2021. That market was doing great. The hotel was in great shape, and we were able to get a really good sales price on that asset. So I think it really does depend a lot on the situation. Remember that owned lease also has termination fees, and that also I would expect not to be growing, but also to continue to provide somewhere in the ballpark of $40 million in fees a year. And then on the owned leased profit, I think you will continue to see progress. But do remember that we have a chunk of leased hotels. And there, you obviously need to get to where you're covering your fixed rent payment to the extent it is fixed rent, which will mean it behaves a little bit more like a U.S. owner's priority where you need to get to a floor before you're actually getting any profit. So I think we look forward to seeing the numbers get better and better. But in terms of getting back to the full levels of 2019, I think it will take a little bit of time."

Please note this call may be recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance. And it's now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJackie Burka: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott 's third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer, Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President Business Operations. And Betsy Dawn, our Vice President of Investor Relations. We are very high happy to not only be doing this call altogether in person this morning, but to be doing it from the road at the beautiful JW Marriott Orlando Bonnet Creek.  I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filing, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold.  Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of September 30th, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full-year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Over the past few months, I've been fortunate to have spent the majority of my time back on the road. I've been speaking with our associates, meeting with customers, attending industry conferences, and engaging with our owners and franchisees as I've been doing this week here in Orlando. My travels have taken me to Europe, the Caribbean, in Latin America, and many parts of the country here in the U.S. It's been wonderful to see so many people traveling again and to witness firsthand the resilience of global travel. This resilience was clearly evident during the third quarter.  The strong global RevPAR recovery momentum we experienced in the spring continued into the summer, thanks to sustained, robust leisure demand and impressive average daily rates. July worldwide RevPAR reached a new peak since the beginning of the pandemic, down just 23% compared to 2019 levels. Occupancy in July rose to 61%, an increase of over 500 basis points from June, while ADR was down less than 3% versus July of 2019. In August, global demand softened a bit primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies' return to the office.  However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October. Recovery trajectories remain varied by region and have been uneven. RevPAR and all of our regions except for greater China improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The recovery in Greater China has been choppier given it's zero COVID-19 policy. Mainland China was the first market to see RevPAR return to pre pandemic levels a quarter ago. And RevPAR rose again in July to 11% above July of 2019. But demand then fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID outbreaks, leading to a meaningful decline in RevPAR for the month.  Demand then swiftly rose again in September, as soon as those restrictions were lifted. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR performance improved meaningfully to down less than 20% compared to the same quarter of 2019. Results were driven by elevated leisure demand and ADR nearly at 2019 levels. Total occupancy reached 67% in July, retrenched a bit in August, and held steady in September before rising again in October. Third quarter RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada improved across all brand tiers and all market segments, primary, secondary, and tertiary.  While primary markets are still the most challenged, these markets saw the larges RevPAR gains during the quarter as demand in gateway cities like New York continued to rise. Group demand accelerated nicely in the U.S and Canada in the quarter. Group room revenues for the quarter were down 46% versus the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter's decline of 76% versus the same time period in '19. Group bookings have also been increasing. In the year for the year, U.S. -managed group bookings beat 2019 levels for each of the last 5 months through October, as event-booking windows have shortened during the pandemic.  Most importantly, group ADRs continued to rise, and for full-year 2022, it's currently pacing nearly 4% above pre -pandemic levels. In the U.S. and Canada, special corporate was the segment most impacted by the Delta variant during the quarter, given the delay in return to office timelines. As a reminder, the special corporate segment represents business transient customers who book at pre -negotiated rates. We estimate this segment has been accounting for roughly 1/2 of business transient room nights, although we can't know with certainty the trip purpose for transient bookings other than special corporate.  The special corporate segment therefore gives us the best indication of business demand trends. Special corporate bookings showed steady recovery each month this year until we saw a slight pullback in the back half of the third quarter. The gradual upward trajectory returned in October with bookings versus 2019 growing each week during the month. Special corporate bookings are currently down less than 40% compared to the same time frame in 2019.  From conversations with our corporate customers, we know that many of them, especially those with more client-facing jobs, are increasingly eager to get back on the road. We expect a recovery in business transient to gradually continue as more workers returned to the office, guest visitation policies are relaxed, and greater numbers of employees are permitted to travel again. We also expect the traditional business trip to continue to evolve with a blurring of the lines between business and leisure travel.  In the Middle East and Africa, third quarter RevPAR came in less than 20% below pre -pandemic levels, led by strong performance in the UAE and Qatar. RevPAR top third quarter 2019 levels in Qatar, thanks to preparations for the 2022 World Cup. While RevPAR in the UAE was nearly even with 2019, largely benefiting from Staycations. Europe's recovery took another large step forward in the quarter. Occupancy doubled in one quarter to reach 47% as many key international borders reopened, entry restrictions eased, and almost all hotels were once again open. The Caribbean and Latin America posted third quarter RevPAR 18% below 2019 levels. Demand for our resort properties remained robust, particularly in the Caribbean and Mexico.  Urban destinations, while slowly improving, still lagged. Historically, the third quarter is the region's softest quarter seasonally, yet many resorts saw record occupancy in ADRs, and our luxury ADR in the region for the quarter was ahead of 2019 levels by 32%. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, advanced more slowly in the third quarter. Results were mixed across countries, though India saw meaningful improvement in demand as COVID caseloads dropped and restrictions lifted.  Encouragingly, many countries in the region have recently taken significant steps to reopen travel, such as announcing new vaccinated travel lanes. Demand in October accelerated nicely as a result. Developers\u2019 sentiment continues to improve in step with the global recovery and the pace of signings has picked up meaningfully this year. At the end of September, our pipeline stood at nearly 477,000 rooms. Gross room openings through the third quarter of this year exceeded the first 9 months of 2019 by 25% and surpassed the same period last year by almost 50%, and deletions from the pipeline remain at the low end of our long-term trend.  Conversions remain a meaningful driver of rooms growth, given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system. We've already added more conversion rooms in the first nine months of this year than we did in all of 2019. Accounting for over 30% of all signings in the first 9 months of this year compared to around 15% of signings pre -pandemic, conversions are expected to be a significant contributor to growth over the next several years.  For the full-year, we still expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to around 6%. With more clarity around our estimated full-year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth will be approximately 3.5%. The attractiveness of our brands is increasing development activity, our momentum around conversions, and our industry-leading pipeline give us confidence that we will see meaningful rooms growth going forward. We expect that over the next several years, we will get back to our typical mid-single-digit net rooms growth that we demonstrated prior to the pandemic.  However, the exact timing is hard to predict and will depend on a host of factors related to the global recovery, including the lending environment and evolving supply chain dynamics. Supply chain issues have pushed some openings and construction starts out a few months. But the deals continue to move forward. Turning to Marriott Bonvoy, global enrollments driven by digital sign-ups, accelerated during the quarter, growing the program to a 157 million members as of the end of September. We remain extremely focused on fostering engagement with our members.  We recently rolled out numerous successful special promotions such as our second annual Week of Wonders and the re-launch of Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where members can use points to gain VIP access to a broad variety of experiences. Additionally, we just announced several loyalty program updates including status, award, and point extensions, which should further encourage members to stay with us as global travel rebounds. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown our share of bookings coming through our digital and other direct channels.  Over 76% of our global room nights in the first 3 quarters of the year were booked through our direct channels, with around half of these booked through our digital channels. In closing, I firmly believe that the long-term recovery is on track. The resilience of travel and consumers desire to visit our 7,900 global properties is undeniable. And I'm looking ahead with a lot of optimism about our future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. We're pleased with our third quarter results which reflect the continued meaningful improvement in the global recovery. Third quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 26% compared to the same quarter in 2019, despite the impact of the Delta variant in the latter half of the quarter. In comparison, global RevPAR declined 44% in the second quarter versus the same period in 2019. Worldwide occupancy rose to 58% in the third quarter and ADR was only 4% below the third quarter of 2019. We've been very pleased to see rate almost back at pre -pandemic levels in just 20 months.  In comparison, global ADR have lagged the recovery in RevPAR in prior downturns, taking around 5 years to rebound after the 2009 recession and around 4 years to recover post 9-11. Importantly, the recovering rate has not just been driven by customer mix. Our third quarter retail or rack rate in the U.S. and Canada was essentially flat with the third quarter of 2019. Gross fee revenue reached $776 million in the third quarter. Our non - RevPAR related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $173 million in the third quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels.  Credit card branding fees of $113 million were up 11% compared to the 2019 third quarter, on the back of strong new account acquisitions and robust global card spending. Our residential branding fees also had another outstanding quarter totaling $18 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $53 million in the quarter. Over 40% of IMFs were earned at resort properties, with IMF from our luxury resorts around the world up almost 30% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  We were pleased to see positive results from our owned and leased portfolio in the quarter, primarily due to improve performance at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Third quarter G&A and other expense totaled $212 million and were impacted by compensation true-ups and additional legal expenses. We continue to realize meaningful savings from the significant restructuring activities undertaken last year, and we still expect full-year G&A and other to be roughly $800 million down 15% to 2019 levels. We also recorded a $164 million pretax loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter associated with the repurchase of a billion dollars of our 5.75% senior notes due in May 2025.  As part of our balance sheet management, we have focused on bringing down our average interest rate, lengthening our average debt maturities, and reducing our debt balances. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our outstanding net debt by $1.4 billion. At the hotel level, we have significantly improved margins to lower break-even occupancy levels around the world. In the third quarter, even with RevPAR for managed properties in the U.S. and Canada down 27% versus pre -pandemic levels, 97% of our managed hotels in the region had positive GOP or gross operating profit.  We're proud of the work our teams have done in maximizing margins during the pandemic. We expect many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we have implemented will be maintained as occupancies continue to rise. Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled. But our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. As demand continues to rise, we're working closely with our owners and franchisees to maximize hotel profitability while delivering the outstanding guest experiences our customers expect from our brands.  We're close to completing an extensive review of our brand standards and are already implementing numerous changes intended to help reduce into our operating expenses while improving flexibility based on customer needs as occupancies rise. Looking ahead, we're still not in a position to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, but I would like to share some general observations and provide color on certain additional items, where we do have some visibility. We're optimistic about the pace of global recovery as we look ahead into next year, as more markets reopen around the world.  With meaningful continued improvement in business transient and group demand, continued growth in leisure demand, and healthy levels of ADR, we expect to make substantial progress in closing the gap to 2019 RevPAR levels by the end of next year, assuming no major setbacks in the pandemic recovery. To further help your modeling for 2021, as a reminder, the fourth and the first quarters of the year historically have seen lower demand than the second and third quarters. In 2019, global occupancy fell around 6% points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Turning to fees, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full-year 2020. RevPAR versus 2019, could be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variabilities of IMFs and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong credit card and residential branding fees. Interest expense is now anticipated to be around $420 million.  Full-year cash taxes are now expected to be $350 million to $375 million. Our anticipated full-year cash flow from the loyalty program has not changed from our expectation a quarter-ago. We still expect it to be positive for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we've received in 2020, we continue to anticipate modestly negative cash flows from loyalty.  We remain focused on carefully watching capital expenditures and we now expect full-year investment spending of $525 to $550 million below our expectation of $575 to $625 million that we shared last quarter. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. As we think about capital allocation, retaining our investment grade credit rating remains a top priority.  We're making excellent progress bringing our credit ratios back in line as we continue to generate positive cash flow and manage our spending levels. Assuming this progress continues, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We're very enthusiastic about how our business is performing, and we're happy now to take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Once again if you would like to ask a question, and we will take our first question from Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJoe Greff : Good morning everybody.\nTony Capuano : Morning.\nJoe Greff : Thank you for taking my questions. I know you don't want to necessarily talk about 2022 with any great specificity. But I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the leisure segment as we head into next year, obviously, that's a segment this year, where demand has recovered the most, pricing has been fairly inelastic, and price obviously upped significantly. Do you think leisure can maintain some growth trajectory in 2022 or do you think that has to come down? And then obviously, it's more than compensated by the growth in the business transient segment. How are you thinking about that right now?\nTony Capuano : Thanks for the question, Joe. We are -- continue to be quite bullish about leisure. We think there's lots more run room in terms of this leisure-led recovery. You heard some of the statistics that Leeny and I shared in our prepared remarks about the performance and the pricing power that we've seen in our resort destinations. And so, the short answer is we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow into '22.\nLeeny Oberg : Joe, one other comment I'll make is that we've seen -- actually, since 2010, we've seen leisure trips grow faster than business trip. And I think with the reality that there's still some pent-up demand as well as increased savings rates, and frankly, more flexibility in travel that we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow going into '22.\nJoe Greff : Great. And you mentioned it on the call and you haven it in the press release that you have greater visibility on deletions and I know that the room deletions comment was really specific for this year. Can you talk about the visibility on deletions for next year and maybe where that trends? Obviously, I'm not looking for a gross or net rooms growth number, but just how are you see the visibility on deletions for '22 maybe relative to historical percentage deletion rates?\nLeeny Oberg : Great question. We're in the middle of our budgeting process now, so I think we feel extremely solid about the numbers for '21. It's too early to give you a specific number, but obviously the one-time bump that we had this year from the SEC portfolio, we don't expect to happen. And I do believe that it will fall back to more normal levels in 2022 with perhaps still a tinge of COVID -related impact. But I think more likely to be falling back into levels that you've seen before.\nJoe Greff : Great. Thank you, guys.\nTony Capuano : Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nShaun Kelley : Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Maybe as my first -- Tony asked the same question. If I could, but you're focusing a little bit more on corporate and group. Obviously, we're right at the cusp of probably how much lead time you have. But can you just talk a little bit about corporate behavior and give us a little color through as the things are rebounding a little bit in October, but what little signs do we have heading into '22 on, what I consider core business transient, and then also just maybe on the group bookings front?\nTony Capuano : Of course. The biggest improvement we expect or that we saw this quarter came from business transient, which is -- already picked up even a bit in October. We're quite encouraged. Special corporate bookings have improved each week in October as when we compare them to 2019. And because you asked for a little bit of granularity, I can tell you that new special corporate bookings in October for some of our key customer categories had some really nice growth, and I'll give you 2 examples. Accounting and consulting grew 35% over what we saw last month, and technology business grew about 31% versus last month.  When I switch to group, which was the second part of your question, at the end of September, roof revenue was pacing down around 43% versus '19. But we think we can see some improvement from that level given the volume of last-minute bookings, which have been quite a significant recent trend. In the quarter -- fourth quarter bookings in October, were above October of '19 by the highest percentage we've seen since the pandemic began. And maybe the last thing I would tell you on group that is also quite encouraging, when we look at the group that's on the books for 2022, the ADR for that group is up to about 3 -- almost 4% relative to the group that was on the books for 2019.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up, if we could -- could you just give us a little bit -- there's been more discussion in the industry than probably as normal about small and medium-sized corporates and that activity rebounding a bit faster than what we've seen in maybe the larger Fortune 500 or top 50 accounts. Could you talk a little bit about that exposure for Marriott if you break it down that way or maybe the behaviors that you're seeing between small and medium and large-sized corporates?\nTony Capuano : Yes, of course. Historically, we saw business transient business coming out of small and medium-sized companies was about 60% of our business transient revenue. Now, given that the larger businesses have been a little slower to recover during the pandemic, for the first 3 quarters of this year, we've seen about 75% of that revenue coming from small and medium accounts.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano : Of course.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nThomas Allen : Thank you. Given much of your marketing spend is done through the system fund, it'd be interesting to hear just an update on where you are in your marketing strategy and spend for this pre - COVID. I remember back to early 2019, you did a big Bonvoy push. I'm just trying to think about what you're doing now and potential implications for distribution and market share. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg : You're absolutely right that broadly speaking, our marketing spend is a function of the top-line revenue from our hotels. And that is in 2 places Thomas. 1 is obviously in classic sales and marketing fund, but also when you think about the revenues coming into our loyalty program are also driven by a combination of our credit card spend as well as hotel revenues and penetration of Bonvoy stays at our hotels. And so clearly that is still meaningfully down from 2019. However, obviously a whole lot better than it was in 2020.  And I'm sure you've seen lately, we've done a fabulous new campaign that has been on everywhere from airlines to sports -- on sports games, etc., that really emphasize how special it is to be able to travel and to have experiences that open your mind, if you will. And so, it's been a really concentrated reminder to the -- to our consumers of how special travel is. And that new campaign has generated incredible response from all the different customers and media touch points.\nThomas Allen : Okay. Just as a follow-up, just can you update us on OTA distribution and your thoughts there? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. It's very similar to what we've talked about before, which is that clearly, the OTAs have gained share as a result of special corporate being down on a relative basis. But we're still seeing that our digital channels are gaining share faster than the OTAs. So, while -- I'd say the OTAs are probably now at about 14% of total bookings. You still remember that our direct channels are over 76% and about half of that is coming through the digital channel. So, we're very pleased to see that digital continues to gain share very nicely. Our mobile app downloads have grown really well. So, the OTAs have been an important driver of business for us during this pandemic, but I think from a share perspective, we're continuing to see the same trends we've been seeing.\nThomas Allen : Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Scholes : Hi. Good morning.\nTony Capuano : Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes : Morning, morning. Hilton has been pretty vocal about having daily housekeeping on demand and I haven't heard as much from you folks. What do you think about that going toward especially for your mid-scale types of properties?\nTony Capuano : Plus, a timely question Patrick, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've just spent 2 full days with a significant number of our owners and franchisees here in North America. As we shared with them, we continue to run a few different proofs of concept of valuating how we strike the right balance between guest expectations and the economic challenges that our owner community continues to face. We got tremendous engagement and input from that community, and I think we continue to move towards a more definitive and permanent position on housekeeping.\nPatrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up question. You had noted eventually getting back to your mid-single digits long-term net unit growth. But for next year, is it reasonable to assume that net unit growth percentages will be roughly similar to what they are this year?\nTony Capuano : It's too early to give specific expectations. Now, what I can tell you is we are with increasing confidence feeling like in the midterm we're going to get back to that mid-single digit rooms growth. But I think it'll be a bit challenging next year, and we'll be challenged for a few reasons. I think number 1, the continued unpredictability of the pandemic, but maybe more impactful, we have seen some delays in construction starts, some of which have been direct results of interruption to the supply chain.  But again, those feel like short-term impediments. And in fact, it's interesting if you look at the pipeline. Both in Q2 and Q3, the fall out we saw was the lowest we've seen in the last 3 years. So that would certainly suggest that while we may have to struggle through a bit of these short-term delays, it actually bolsters our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single digit growth rate.\nPatrick Scholes : Okay. Thank you for the update.\nTony Capuano : You're welcome.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nStephen Grambling : Hi. Thanks. I guess to follow up on the initial 2022 expectations, what guardrails can investors think about around the more concrete expense items such as G&A? And should the relationship you've outlined between RevPAR and EBITDA generally hold as we think into future years?\nLeeny Oberg : Sure. A couple of things. On the G&A front, I think certainly you have to take into consideration what's going on with wage and benefit inflation. And then I think as we get back to more fully loaded RevPAR numbers in the system, I think you should expect that for the next year anyway, that it'll be a little bit higher than just inflation as we get the organization back to full operations.  But again, I still think that you're looking at overall levels of G&A reflecting the significant work that we did in 2020 to rebuild Marriott so that it still will be meaningfully lower than the kind of guidance that we gave at the beginning of 2020, which was $950 to $960 million. Similarly, as you ask about -- what was your other question that you asked about, Stephen?\nStephen Grambling : Just as we think about the relationship between RevPAR --\nLeeny Oberg : Yeah, for EBITDA and RevPAR. Yes, I think it will be the same except perhaps a little bit bigger, as we have more and more owned lease profits coming back as well as IMF coming back. If you remember, pre -pandemic, we were close to $50 million per point of RevPAR. We're obviously getting hopefully closer to $40 million and that's obviously hotel-related RevPAR. The non-RevPAR will tie much more into both the residential fees as well as the credit card fees, but it should expand. Although, I think again in 2022, it will still be closer to the $40 million in 2022 and then again continue to grow from there.\nStephen Grambling : And since you mentioned the non-hotel-related fees and credit card fees, I think you referenced that you'd had very strong sign-ups. Can you just remind us of how a customer typically progresses once it signs up? Do you see a burst of spending right at sign-up or is there a gradual build. Are you seeing any changes in engagement than that?\nLeeny Oberg : Absolutely, absolutely a gradual build. You're right. It absolutely takes a while to get going.\nStephen Grambling : Great. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.\nTony Capuano : Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit more on the group bookings that you are seeing in the U.S. Is it fair to say that that sort of larger CVD to more group-oriented properties are continuing to lag or have you seen -- are you seeing any uptick there and maybe any other just changes in the competition of group?\nTony Capuano : Of course. Maybe I'll give you some macro-observations. But before I do that, certainly we're seeing really strong social group activity and expect that to continue. In terms of city-wise, which I think was part of your question, it was interesting. We spent the last 2 days with many of our full-service owners here in the U.S., and I think their view is they're seeing softness in city-wide activity in the first half of '22, but are hopeful they'll start to see some pickup in the back half of next year.  More broadly around group, you heard some of the comments I made in the prepared remarks. Q3 revenues down 46% in group as compared to '19, which was a big uptick compared to the statistics we shared with you last quarter, where we were down 76% versus '19. The other statistic I would share with you that I think is interesting, in-the quarter-for-the-quarter bookings in October were above in-the-quarter-for the-quarter bookings from October '19 by over 30%, which is the highest percentage increase we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic.\nSmedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. And then I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about what your owners are saying on labor costs. It sounds like you're somewhat optimistic about growth in IMF next year, and I'm just trying to square that with the fact. We heard from one owner last night that labor's up 20%. I'm just wondering what your folks are saying.\nTony Capuano : Of course. Like many other companies around the country and around the world, we are seeing some challenges with labor. It won't surprise you that those challenges are most acute in the markets where we've seen the most rapid recovery in demand, so leisure destinations kind of leading the way. From our perspective, we're -- we have a multi-pronged approach to try and address those issues.  We've been doing -- we've ramped up our efforts in social and targeted marketing, highlighting the extraordinary opportunities that exist at Marriott. We have in some instances used one-time sign-on bonuses or temporary incentives. And we do still have many open positions to fill. But we are seeing a bit of an uptick in applicant flow and have been filling jobs pretty steadily over the last several months.\nLeeny Oberg : And I would add, we are not hearing from our owners that it's universally 20%. There may be a couple of markets here and there where that could be happening in a particular situation, but broadly speaking, while it's clearly meaningfully higher than it was back in '18 and '19, I would say 20% is not the norm. And the only other thing I'll say is that while ADR is still not back to 2019 levels, traditionally in our business, we have been able to see that ADR tends to be able to hold onto inflation that we've seen ADR increases that at least inflation, if not higher. And while clearly at the moment we're not back there yet, that should be helpful as well.\nSmedes Rose : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDavid Katz : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.\nLeeny Oberg : Good morning.\nDavid Katz : Good morning. I know that we have seemingly a fair amount of time to discuss this, but with respect to capital returns, if you could just talk about what would have to happen for capital returns to maybe start earlier or later, for that matter. And within the construct of those capital returns, any changes in how you would think about the mix of buybacks versus dividends and the puts and takes around those just so we can start the conversation now nice and early? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg : Sure. So, first of all, similar messages to what you've heard before, which maintaining our investment-grade credit rating is a top priority for Marriott. We do want to continue to get our credit ratios back to the 3 to 3.5 times levels of debt-to-EBITDA. We are really pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard, probably happened faster than we might have imagined a year ago. And so, with that in mind, we are feeling increasingly confident that we'll be able to turn to returning capital to shareholders, perhaps with continued progress in the recovery in the back half of 2022.  When we think about the mix of dividends versus share repurchases, I think it's instructive to look at what we did in the great recession, which is that we -- as we move closer and closer to that 3 times to 3.5 times range, we reinstituted a modest, a smaller than -- smaller than it was before cash dividend and then returned to the normal level of cash dividend before we began share repurchases. And Tony and I will be talking about that to the board and continuing to have a dialog, but I don't think that that's a pretty good framework for you to consider as we move forward.  I think from a rationale, David, I think one of the things we really like about the 3 to 3.5 times level for us is the flexibility then it then gives us when we see an opportunistic investment come our way. And so, we do want to return to that area knowing that when those come up, we want to be able to take advantage of them. And in that regard, re-establishing that policy and those levels, I think is where we're headed.\nDavid Katz : Perfect. And if I can just follow-up with one model in detail, when we look back historically versus this year with the differential and cost reimbursements in revenue in costs. There are periodic positives versus negatives, and this year it's been more of a positive so far. Is there any sort of input you can help us, with the remainder of this year and how that evolves into next year, just to keep our model straight?\nLeeny Oberg : Sure. I think as a reminder, over time the idea is that is essentially net neutral to the Company, i.e., these are cost reimbursements without a profit component. And the timing of the revenues and the expenses can obviously vary. Just to your point, as you look at what's happened this year, you have seen that the gap has narrowed between the net reimbursed revenue line, and that's really a reflection of loyalty.  When you think about last year, far fewer redemptions were taking place and we had lowered our administrative costs in the loyalty program to take into consideration the much lower RevPAR that we had in the system. So naturally, that has come back to a higher level this year as -- and redemption have also grown meaningfully. But again, I think over time, you'll continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But over time, the general direction is net neutral to the Company.\nDavid Katz : Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Will take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nTony Capuano : Good morning, Bill.\nLeeny Oberg : Morning Bill. Are you there Bill function on your phone.\nBill Crow : All right. Sorry about that. Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg : Morning.\nBill Crow : Tony, I appreciate the comments on special corporate rated business travel and the pickup you're seeing in that consulting and technology in particular. Curious whether the destinations have changed. As we look at the STR data, it's pretty barren in some of these bigger -- New York, Chicago, San Francisco. Is that consistent with where your -- what you're seeing from the special corporate rate of business?\nLeeny Oberg : First of all, as we talked about, the smaller and medium-sized business transient has been relatively stronger, and that, to your point, is more likely to be in secondary and tertiary markets. However, during Q3, we saw the best improvement in our big cities in special corporate that we've seen since the pandemic. So, I think it is absolutely moving in the right direction, including those larger cities.\nBill Crow : Okay. And then my follow-up is kind of on a bigger picture basis. Should we be putting a bigger risk premium on the fee income coming out of China given the changes in Government attitudes going on there?\nTony Capuano : Well, how much time do we have, Bill? I think -- listen, China is a really important market for us, it is a dynamic and evolving market. Like anybody that's got a significant footprint in China, we continue to watch with great interest and great focus the evolving landscape there. But when you look at the composition of ownership that we have, when you look at the percentage of our portfolio that has whole or partial ownership by state-owned enterprises, I don't think we look at it as having any really remarkably higher risk profile than we've thought for the last number of quarters.\nLeeny Oberg : And one reminder is that -- is I'm sure you know all too well; we typically do not have an owner's priority on our IMF there. And so, the IMF actually behaves very similarly to base fees.\nBill Crow : Okay. Thank you for the comments.\nTony Capuano : Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nDori Kesten : Thanks. Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg : Hey, Dori. Good morning.\nDori Kesten : Hey. Based on early conversations that you're having with developers, how do you expect signings to trend over the next several quarters, and are there certain markets that you're having to provide additional incentives that you haven't historically?\nTony Capuano : Well, as I mentioned earlier, the pace of global signings has picked up significantly since the bottom of the trough created by the pandemic, year-to-date our signings are up or about 30% compared to where we were same time last year. What we hear anecdotally from our partners, financing for acquisitions and conversions of existing assets continues to be pretty readily available, construction financing for new builds is more challenging.  The construction financing that is out there as we've seen in other more conventional down-markets tends to rely heavily on relationship lending, tends to rely heavily on quality of sponsorship and tends to rely heavily on the quality of the brand affiliation. In terms of additional investments, we are not seeing any remarkable spike in the use of the Company's balance sheet.  The guiding principles that have guided our deal-making in good and bad markets remain intact. In instances where we see strategic imperative or in instances where we think we can drive premium fees and earnings for the Company, we will consider use of the Company's balance sheet.\nDori Kesten : And I may have missed this, but what was the reasoning for the lower investment spending in 2020 -- I'm sorry, in '21?\nLeeny Oberg : No, it's fine. As we've talked about before, a couple of things: 1. is that we did talk about how some construction starts have pushed forward a little bit, and so that would then impact some of when the key money goes out the door. But probably more importantly and larger is we just really are able to refine the amount of CapEX that we're going to spend on system CapEX as well as the Company's new headquarters building. And when you put those together, you get the reduction that we described today in the press release.\nDori Kesten : Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano : Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nRich Hightower : Hey. Good morning, everybody.\nLeeny Oberg : Morning.\nRich Hightower : Just in terms of the development pipeline again, I guess given that it's a little more heavily skewed towards luxury and upper upscale than maybe some of your peers, wondering if you could describe any differences in the economics of those tiers specifically versus the select service tiers. And even by geography, are there are there any pockets of tightness more so than the average around construction costs, lending availability, etc. etc. that we should be aware of?\nTony Capuano : Sure. Maybe I'll remind you, we got a question on this topic a quarter ago. And I think the specific question we got was, within our portfolio in terms of the economics to MI or to Marriott from a fee perspective, how would a luxury hotel like a Ritz-Carlton compare to a lower-tier product like a Fairfield Inn? And the response we gave a quarter ago was obviously subject to variability by geography.  But it's about 10X. We see about 10 times the fee potential in a luxury hotel that we typically achieve in a select service hotel. They are more complex projects, they are more capital-intensive projects, the complexities of getting them financed are not insignificant. But as evidenced by the volume of luxury in upper upscale on our portfolio, the strength of our brands, I think command pretty effective ability to source debt for those projects.\nRich Hightower : Yeah. Thanks. I appreciate that. Maybe I'll turn it on its head for a second, but the economics to the owners as well, are there any key differences in that regard versus what actually impacts Marriott itself?\nTony Capuano : As I said, the -- these are complex projects, you heard in Leeny's prepared comments, some pretty extraordinary numbers about our branded residential business. And with increasing frequency, we see the luxury projects being developed as mixed used projects that include a branded residential component that's often critical in again, underwriting those projects and getting them financed. In leisure destinations the premiums we've seen in luxury rates over the last couple of quarters have been extraordinary.\nRich Hightower : All right, thank you.\nTony Capuano : Of course.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open.\nRobin Farley : Great. Thanks. I want to circle back on the group looking outlook. I know you talked about price rates being up 4% next year. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what group bookings is relative to 2019. And I think there's this idea that there's going to be a lot of pent-up demand for it, but I'm wondering if that's actually translated into bookings yet. Maybe obviously not for Q1, but are there quarters in Q2, Q3, or Q4 where the -- what's on the books is back to '19 levels or are groups not pulling the trigger just yet? Thanks.\nTony Capuano : Of course. Thanks, Robin. If I look at 2022 in aggregate and I look at total group revenue on the books at the end of this past quarter and compare that to what was on the books at the end of the third quarter in '19 for 2020, we're down about 20% in gross revenue. We're down about 23% in total booked rooms, and as I mentioned earlier, were up nearly 4% in ADR.\nRobin Farley : Okay, great. Now that's helpful, thanks. And then just on the lower investment spend, and I know Leeny, you mentioned it was kind of refining some of the headquarters\u2019 and system's CapEX. Is there -- is something related to the -- there's something like impaired contract investment in the quarter that -- was there a significant project or maybe it's multiple ones that got canceled or something? Just wondering if that is related.\nLeeny Oberg : No, not at all.\nRobin Farley : So, what's driving the impaired contract investment in the quarter?\nLeeny Oberg : Actually, it was a -- it was not a contract investment. This was an initiative for some international hotels that we had begun in 2019 related to operational improvements in some international hotels. But as a result of COVID and all that is going on in those hotels, it no longer makes sense to carry forward with that. So, the investment that we had put on our books to date needed to be written off. It was actually a program initiative of the Company for the hotels, it was not related to a hotel contract.\nRobin Farley : So, it was like you had made loans to some hotel owners as an incentive and then now the loans are written off? Is that roughly how it works?\nLeeny Oberg : No. No, actually as you know, very often we have programs that we do for our hotels that they reimburse us for. And in some cases, we actually develop the programs and over time, the hotel owners pay us back. And in this case, we had begun work on the program and invested some funds to develop the program and decided once COVID came, it no longer made sense to implement that program at the hotels and have them repay us over time, so we wrote off the investment.\nRobin Farley : Okay. Great. Thank you, that's helpful. I don't know if -- one final. You made a comment when talking about priority of using your cash flow reinstating a smaller dividend than larger dividend, and you mentioned the investment-grade rating to take advantage of opportunities -- to be opportunistic, I think, was the expression you used. Is there anything acquisition-wise that you think about where you would be looking for opportunities? I don't know if you can characterize anything. And then that's it for me. Thanks.\nTony Capuano : I would say that the approach we've taken to evaluating those sorts of opportunities remains intact. If you look at our track record in this area, we don't feel any particular pressure to do acquisitions simply for the sake of scale. If we see a gap in our portfolio, whether that be brand gap or tier gaps that we think represents significant growth opportunity or a significant gap in our geographic footprint that can be solved the way we did with AC in Spain or Protea in South Africa, we would certainly take a look at that. But I think Leeny's comment is really around our capital philosophy to ensure we are in a good position should one of those opportunities present itself.\nRobin Farley : Okay, great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano : Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquire. Your line is now open.\nChad Beynon : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the continued recovery in rates, given how strong it's been, Anthony, you talked about the outlook for Group, but I'm wondering if you could touch on maybe some of the differences in leisure BT in group. Have you guys been able to test and learn maybe how high you can push pricing, or is this tough to do without kind of full compression nights?\nTony Capuano : Well, there's a lot in that question. I think the good news, what we've seen through the last couple of quarters, is the ability of the leisure segment to create compression. And the creation of that compression, almost irrespective of which segment drives the compression, is driving really terrific pricing power. I think when you look at our retail rates across the portfolio, we are essentially back to 2019 levels, and that's another statistical illustration of the strength of our pricing power, and what's really encouraging about that is that we're achieving that pricing power, albeit at lower occupancy levels than we were experiencing in 2019.\nChad Beynon : Okay. Great, and then a quick follow-up, maybe a near-term modeling help. Leeny, you mentioned that normal seasonality is for Q4 over Q3, to be down 6% sequentially from a RevPAR standpoint. Has there been a major difference looking back on leisure versus corporate, given that I think we all expect for corporate to improve sequentially here. Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg : Yeah, sure. I think when you look overall at the business, it is traditionally the case that you have lower business overall. Again, I think interestingly, I actually expect leisure could continue to strengthen because when you think about coming out of the pandemic, increasingly people are feeling comfortable traveling where we see festive bookings in places like CALA, etc., its great demand, and the holidays are pacing up well compared to 2019, so I think we're very encouraged.  But the overall message we were trying to impart is that typically, it is a period just with family holidays, etc. that it is a lower occupancy quarter. And it's worth mentioning that when you go back to 2019 and '18 levels and you look at our EBITDA in Q3 and Q4 as we talked about in our comments, that typically Q3 is a higher RevPAR -driving quarter than Q4 typically.\nChad Beynon : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thanks for the help.\nOperator: And I will now turn the program back over to Tony Capuano for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Capuano : Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in the Company and the recovery of the global travel and tourism industry. We are back on the road and we look forward to running into you in our hotels around the world. Thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Over the past few months, I've been fortunate to have spent the majority of my time back on the road. I've been speaking with our associates, meeting with customers, attending industry conferences, and engaging with our owners and franchisees as I've been doing this week here in Orlando. My travels have taken me to Europe, the Caribbean, in Latin America, and many parts of the country here in the U.S. It's been wonderful to see so many people traveling again and to witness firsthand the resilience of global travel. This resilience was clearly evident during the third quarter.  The strong global RevPAR recovery momentum we experienced in the spring continued into the summer, thanks to sustained, robust leisure demand and impressive average daily rates. July worldwide RevPAR reached a new peak since the beginning of the pandemic, down just 23% compared to 2019 levels. Occupancy in July rose to 61%, an increase of over 500 basis points from June, while ADR was down less than 3% versus July of 2019. In August, global demand softened a bit primarily as a result of the impact of the Delta variant and the subsequent delay in many companies' return to the office.  However, demand stabilized in September before rising once again in October. Recovery trajectories remain varied by region and have been uneven. RevPAR and all of our regions except for greater China improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The recovery in Greater China has been choppier given it's zero COVID-19 policy. Mainland China was the first market to see RevPAR return to pre pandemic levels a quarter ago. And RevPAR rose again in July to 11% above July of 2019. But demand then fell significantly in August after the government imposed strict lockdowns in response to small regional COVID outbreaks, leading to a meaningful decline in RevPAR for the month.  Demand then swiftly rose again in September, as soon as those restrictions were lifted. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR performance improved meaningfully to down less than 20% compared to the same quarter of 2019. Results were driven by elevated leisure demand and ADR nearly at 2019 levels. Total occupancy reached 67% in July, retrenched a bit in August, and held steady in September before rising again in October. Third quarter RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada improved across all brand tiers and all market segments, primary, secondary, and tertiary.  While primary markets are still the most challenged, these markets saw the larges RevPAR gains during the quarter as demand in gateway cities like New York continued to rise. Group demand accelerated nicely in the U.S and Canada in the quarter. Group room revenues for the quarter were down 46% versus the third quarter of 2019, a significant improvement compared to the second quarter's decline of 76% versus the same time period in '19. Group bookings have also been increasing. In the year for the year, U.S. -managed group bookings beat 2019 levels for each of the last 5 months through October, as event-booking windows have shortened during the pandemic.  Most importantly, group ADRs continued to rise, and for full-year 2022, it's currently pacing nearly 4% above pre -pandemic levels. In the U.S. and Canada, special corporate was the segment most impacted by the Delta variant during the quarter, given the delay in return to office timelines. As a reminder, the special corporate segment represents business transient customers who book at pre -negotiated rates. We estimate this segment has been accounting for roughly 1/2 of business transient room nights, although we can't know with certainty the trip purpose for transient bookings other than special corporate.  The special corporate segment therefore gives us the best indication of business demand trends. Special corporate bookings showed steady recovery each month this year until we saw a slight pullback in the back half of the third quarter. The gradual upward trajectory returned in October with bookings versus 2019 growing each week during the month. Special corporate bookings are currently down less than 40% compared to the same time frame in 2019.  From conversations with our corporate customers, we know that many of them, especially those with more client-facing jobs, are increasingly eager to get back on the road. We expect a recovery in business transient to gradually continue as more workers returned to the office, guest visitation policies are relaxed, and greater numbers of employees are permitted to travel again. We also expect the traditional business trip to continue to evolve with a blurring of the lines between business and leisure travel.  In the Middle East and Africa, third quarter RevPAR came in less than 20% below pre -pandemic levels, led by strong performance in the UAE and Qatar. RevPAR top third quarter 2019 levels in Qatar, thanks to preparations for the 2022 World Cup. While RevPAR in the UAE was nearly even with 2019, largely benefiting from Staycations. Europe's recovery took another large step forward in the quarter. Occupancy doubled in one quarter to reach 47% as many key international borders reopened, entry restrictions eased, and almost all hotels were once again open. The Caribbean and Latin America posted third quarter RevPAR 18% below 2019 levels. Demand for our resort properties remained robust, particularly in the Caribbean and Mexico.  Urban destinations, while slowly improving, still lagged. Historically, the third quarter is the region's softest quarter seasonally, yet many resorts saw record occupancy in ADRs, and our luxury ADR in the region for the quarter was ahead of 2019 levels by 32%. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, advanced more slowly in the third quarter. Results were mixed across countries, though India saw meaningful improvement in demand as COVID caseloads dropped and restrictions lifted.  Encouragingly, many countries in the region have recently taken significant steps to reopen travel, such as announcing new vaccinated travel lanes. Demand in October accelerated nicely as a result. Developers' sentiment continues to improve in step with the global recovery and the pace of signings has picked up meaningfully this year. At the end of September, our pipeline stood at nearly 477,000 rooms. Gross room openings through the third quarter of this year exceeded the first 9 months of 2019 by 25% and surpassed the same period last year by almost 50%, and deletions from the pipeline remain at the low end of our long-term trend.  Conversions remain a meaningful driver of rooms growth, given our impressive roster of conversion-friendly brands and the meaningful top and bottom-line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system. We've already added more conversion rooms in the first nine months of this year than we did in all of 2019. Accounting for over 30% of all signings in the first 9 months of this year compared to around 15% of signings pre -pandemic, conversions are expected to be a significant contributor to growth over the next several years.  For the full-year, we still expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to around 6%. With more clarity around our estimated full-year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth will be approximately 3.5%. The attractiveness of our brands is increasing development activity, our momentum around conversions, and our industry-leading pipeline give us confidence that we will see meaningful rooms growth going forward. We expect that over the next several years, we will get back to our typical mid-single-digit net rooms growth that we demonstrated prior to the pandemic.  However, the exact timing is hard to predict and will depend on a host of factors related to the global recovery, including the lending environment and evolving supply chain dynamics. Supply chain issues have pushed some openings and construction starts out a few months. But the deals continue to move forward. Turning to Marriott Bonvoy, global enrollments driven by digital sign-ups, accelerated during the quarter, growing the program to a 157 million members as of the end of September. We remain extremely focused on fostering engagement with our members.  We recently rolled out numerous successful special promotions such as our second annual Week of Wonders and the re-launch of Marriott Bonvoy Moments, where members can use points to gain VIP access to a broad variety of experiences. Additionally, we just announced several loyalty program updates including status, award, and point extensions, which should further encourage members to stay with us as global travel rebounds. Since the start of the pandemic, we've grown our share of bookings coming through our digital and other direct channels.  Over 76% of our global room nights in the first 3 quarters of the year were booked through our direct channels, with around half of these booked through our digital channels. In closing, I firmly believe that the long-term recovery is on track. The resilience of travel and consumers desire to visit our 7,900 global properties is undeniable. And I'm looking ahead with a lot of optimism about our future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny? Morning. Thanks for the question, Joe. We are -- continue to be quite bullish about leisure. We think there's lots more run room in terms of this leisure-led recovery. You heard some of the statistics that Leeny and I shared in our prepared remarks about the performance and the pricing power that we've seen in our resort destinations. And so, the short answer is we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow into '22. Thanks, Joe. Of course. The biggest improvement we expect or that we saw this quarter came from business transient, which is -- already picked up even a bit in October. We're quite encouraged. Special corporate bookings have improved each week in October as when we compare them to 2019. And because you asked for a little bit of granularity, I can tell you that new special corporate bookings in October for some of our key customer categories had some really nice growth, and I'll give you 2 examples. Accounting and consulting grew 35% over what we saw last month, and technology business grew about 31% versus last month.  When I switch to group, which was the second part of your question, at the end of September, roof revenue was pacing down around 43% versus '19. But we think we can see some improvement from that level given the volume of last-minute bookings, which have been quite a significant recent trend. In the quarter -- fourth quarter bookings in October, were above October of '19 by the highest percentage we've seen since the pandemic began. And maybe the last thing I would tell you on group that is also quite encouraging, when we look at the group that's on the books for 2022, the ADR for that group is up to about 3 -- almost 4% relative to the group that was on the books for 2019. Yes, of course. Historically, we saw business transient business coming out of small and medium-sized companies was about 60% of our business transient revenue. Now, given that the larger businesses have been a little slower to recover during the pandemic, for the first 3 quarters of this year, we've seen about 75% of that revenue coming from small and medium accounts. Of course. Good morning. Plus, a timely question Patrick, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we've just spent 2 full days with a significant number of our owners and franchisees here in North America. As we shared with them, we continue to run a few different proofs of concept of valuating how we strike the right balance between guest expectations and the economic challenges that our owner community continues to face. We got tremendous engagement and input from that community, and I think we continue to move towards a more definitive and permanent position on housekeeping. It's too early to give specific expectations. Now, what I can tell you is we are with increasing confidence feeling like in the midterm we're going to get back to that mid-single digit rooms growth. But I think it'll be a bit challenging next year, and we'll be challenged for a few reasons. I think number 1, the continued unpredictability of the pandemic, but maybe more impactful, we have seen some delays in construction starts, some of which have been direct results of interruption to the supply chain.  But again, those feel like short-term impediments. And in fact, it's interesting if you look at the pipeline. Both in Q2 and Q3, the fall out we saw was the lowest we've seen in the last 3 years. So that would certainly suggest that while we may have to struggle through a bit of these short-term delays, it actually bolsters our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single digit growth rate. You're welcome. Thank you. Of course. Maybe I'll give you some macro-observations. But before I do that, certainly we're seeing really strong social group activity and expect that to continue. In terms of city-wise, which I think was part of your question, it was interesting. We spent the last 2 days with many of our full-service owners here in the U.S., and I think their view is they're seeing softness in city-wide activity in the first half of '22, but are hopeful they'll start to see some pickup in the back half of next year.  More broadly around group, you heard some of the comments I made in the prepared remarks. Q3 revenues down 46% in group as compared to '19, which was a big uptick compared to the statistics we shared with you last quarter, where we were down 76% versus '19. The other statistic I would share with you that I think is interesting, in-the quarter-for-the-quarter bookings in October were above in-the-quarter-for the-quarter bookings from October '19 by over 30%, which is the highest percentage increase we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic. Of course. Like many other companies around the country and around the world, we are seeing some challenges with labor. It won't surprise you that those challenges are most acute in the markets where we've seen the most rapid recovery in demand, so leisure destinations kind of leading the way. From our perspective, we're -- we have a multi-pronged approach to try and address those issues.  We've been doing -- we've ramped up our efforts in social and targeted marketing, highlighting the extraordinary opportunities that exist at Marriott. We have in some instances used one-time sign-on bonuses or temporary incentives. And we do still have many open positions to fill. But we are seeing a bit of an uptick in applicant flow and have been filling jobs pretty steadily over the last several months. Good morning, Bill. Well, how much time do we have, Bill? I think -- listen, China is a really important market for us, it is a dynamic and evolving market. Like anybody that's got a significant footprint in China, we continue to watch with great interest and great focus the evolving landscape there. But when you look at the composition of ownership that we have, when you look at the percentage of our portfolio that has whole or partial ownership by state-owned enterprises, I don't think we look at it as having any really remarkably higher risk profile than we've thought for the last number of quarters. Thank you. Well, as I mentioned earlier, the pace of global signings has picked up significantly since the bottom of the trough created by the pandemic, year-to-date our signings are up or about 30% compared to where we were same time last year. What we hear anecdotally from our partners, financing for acquisitions and conversions of existing assets continues to be pretty readily available, construction financing for new builds is more challenging.  The construction financing that is out there as we've seen in other more conventional down-markets tends to rely heavily on relationship lending, tends to rely heavily on quality of sponsorship and tends to rely heavily on the quality of the brand affiliation. In terms of additional investments, we are not seeing any remarkable spike in the use of the Company's balance sheet.  The guiding principles that have guided our deal-making in good and bad markets remain intact. In instances where we see strategic imperative or in instances where we think we can drive premium fees and earnings for the Company, we will consider use of the Company's balance sheet. Thank you. Sure. Maybe I'll remind you, we got a question on this topic a quarter ago. And I think the specific question we got was, within our portfolio in terms of the economics to MI or to Marriott from a fee perspective, how would a luxury hotel like a Ritz-Carlton compare to a lower-tier product like a Fairfield Inn? And the response we gave a quarter ago was obviously subject to variability by geography.  But it's about 10X. We see about 10 times the fee potential in a luxury hotel that we typically achieve in a select service hotel. They are more complex projects, they are more capital-intensive projects, the complexities of getting them financed are not insignificant. But as evidenced by the volume of luxury in upper upscale on our portfolio, the strength of our brands, I think command pretty effective ability to source debt for those projects. As I said, the -- these are complex projects, you heard in Leeny's prepared comments, some pretty extraordinary numbers about our branded residential business. And with increasing frequency, we see the luxury projects being developed as mixed used projects that include a branded residential component that's often critical in again, underwriting those projects and getting them financed. In leisure destinations the premiums we've seen in luxury rates over the last couple of quarters have been extraordinary. Of course. Of course. Thanks, Robin. If I look at 2022 in aggregate and I look at total group revenue on the books at the end of this past quarter and compare that to what was on the books at the end of the third quarter in '19 for 2020, we're down about 20% in gross revenue. We're down about 23% in total booked rooms, and as I mentioned earlier, were up nearly 4% in ADR. I would say that the approach we've taken to evaluating those sorts of opportunities remains intact. If you look at our track record in this area, we don't feel any particular pressure to do acquisitions simply for the sake of scale. If we see a gap in our portfolio, whether that be brand gap or tier gaps that we think represents significant growth opportunity or a significant gap in our geographic footprint that can be solved the way we did with AC in Spain or Protea in South Africa, we would certainly take a look at that. But I think Leeny's comment is really around our capital philosophy to ensure we are in a good position should one of those opportunities present itself. Thank you. Well, there's a lot in that question. I think the good news, what we've seen through the last couple of quarters, is the ability of the leisure segment to create compression. And the creation of that compression, almost irrespective of which segment drives the compression, is driving really terrific pricing power. I think when you look at our retail rates across the portfolio, we are essentially back to 2019 levels, and that's another statistical illustration of the strength of our pricing power, and what's really encouraging about that is that we're achieving that pricing power, albeit at lower occupancy levels than we were experiencing in 2019. Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you for your continued interest in the Company and the recovery of the global travel and tourism industry. We are back on the road and we look forward to running into you in our hotels around the world. Thanks again, and have a great day."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. We're pleased with our third quarter results which reflect the continued meaningful improvement in the global recovery. Third quarter worldwide RevPAR was down 26% compared to the same quarter in 2019, despite the impact of the Delta variant in the latter half of the quarter. In comparison, global RevPAR declined 44% in the second quarter versus the same period in 2019. Worldwide occupancy rose to 58% in the third quarter and ADR was only 4% below the third quarter of 2019. We've been very pleased to see rate almost back at pre -pandemic levels in just 20 months.  In comparison, global ADR have lagged the recovery in RevPAR in prior downturns, taking around 5 years to rebound after the 2009 recession and around 4 years to recover post 9-11. Importantly, the recovering rate has not just been driven by customer mix. Our third quarter retail or rack rate in the U.S. and Canada was essentially flat with the third quarter of 2019. Gross fee revenue reached $776 million in the third quarter. Our non - RevPAR related franchise fees were again particularly strong, totaling $173 million in the third quarter, 19% ahead of 2019 levels.  Credit card branding fees of $113 million were up 11% compared to the 2019 third quarter, on the back of strong new account acquisitions and robust global card spending. Our residential branding fees also had another outstanding quarter totaling $18 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $53 million in the quarter. Over 40% of IMFs were earned at resort properties, with IMF from our luxury resorts around the world up almost 30% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  We were pleased to see positive results from our owned and leased portfolio in the quarter, primarily due to improve performance at hotels in the U.S. and Europe. Third quarter G&A and other expense totaled $212 million and were impacted by compensation true-ups and additional legal expenses. We continue to realize meaningful savings from the significant restructuring activities undertaken last year, and we still expect full-year G&A and other to be roughly $800 million down 15% to 2019 levels. We also recorded a $164 million pretax loss on extinguishment of debt during the quarter associated with the repurchase of a billion dollars of our 5.75% senior notes due in May 2025.  As part of our balance sheet management, we have focused on bringing down our average interest rate, lengthening our average debt maturities, and reducing our debt balances. Over the last 18 months, we have reduced our outstanding net debt by $1.4 billion. At the hotel level, we have significantly improved margins to lower break-even occupancy levels around the world. In the third quarter, even with RevPAR for managed properties in the U.S. and Canada down 27% versus pre -pandemic levels, 97% of our managed hotels in the region had positive GOP or gross operating profit.  We're proud of the work our teams have done in maximizing margins during the pandemic. We expect many of the cost reduction and productivity enhancement initiatives we have implemented will be maintained as occupancies continue to rise. Given the current labor environment, we are keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation as associates are hired back and open positions are filled. But our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. As demand continues to rise, we're working closely with our owners and franchisees to maximize hotel profitability while delivering the outstanding guest experiences our customers expect from our brands.  We're close to completing an extensive review of our brand standards and are already implementing numerous changes intended to help reduce into our operating expenses while improving flexibility based on customer needs as occupancies rise. Looking ahead, we're still not in a position to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, but I would like to share some general observations and provide color on certain additional items, where we do have some visibility. We're optimistic about the pace of global recovery as we look ahead into next year, as more markets reopen around the world.  With meaningful continued improvement in business transient and group demand, continued growth in leisure demand, and healthy levels of ADR, we expect to make substantial progress in closing the gap to 2019 RevPAR levels by the end of next year, assuming no major setbacks in the pandemic recovery. To further help your modeling for 2021, as a reminder, the fourth and the first quarters of the year historically have seen lower demand than the second and third quarters. In 2019, global occupancy fell around 6% points from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.  Turning to fees, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full-year 2020. RevPAR versus 2019, could be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variabilities of IMFs and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong credit card and residential branding fees. Interest expense is now anticipated to be around $420 million.  Full-year cash taxes are now expected to be $350 million to $375 million. Our anticipated full-year cash flow from the loyalty program has not changed from our expectation a quarter-ago. We still expect it to be positive for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around 1/3 of the total $920 million we've received in 2020, we continue to anticipate modestly negative cash flows from loyalty.  We remain focused on carefully watching capital expenditures and we now expect full-year investment spending of $525 to $550 million below our expectation of $575 to $625 million that we shared last quarter. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. As we think about capital allocation, retaining our investment grade credit rating remains a top priority.  We're making excellent progress bringing our credit ratios back in line as we continue to generate positive cash flow and manage our spending levels. Assuming this progress continues, we could be in a position to restart capital returns in the back half of 2022. We're very enthusiastic about how our business is performing, and we're happy now to take your questions. Operator. Joe, one other comment I'll make is that we've seen -- actually, since 2010, we've seen leisure trips grow faster than business trip. And I think with the reality that there's still some pent-up demand as well as increased savings rates, and frankly, more flexibility in travel that we absolutely believe that leisure can continue to grow going into '22. Great question. We're in the middle of our budgeting process now, so I think we feel extremely solid about the numbers for '21. It's too early to give you a specific number, but obviously the one-time bump that we had this year from the SEC portfolio, we don't expect to happen. And I do believe that it will fall back to more normal levels in 2022 with perhaps still a tinge of COVID -related impact. But I think more likely to be falling back into levels that you've seen before. You're absolutely right that broadly speaking, our marketing spend is a function of the top-line revenue from our hotels. And that is in 2 places Thomas. 1 is obviously in classic sales and marketing fund, but also when you think about the revenues coming into our loyalty program are also driven by a combination of our credit card spend as well as hotel revenues and penetration of Bonvoy stays at our hotels. And so clearly that is still meaningfully down from 2019. However, obviously a whole lot better than it was in 2020.  And I'm sure you've seen lately, we've done a fabulous new campaign that has been on everywhere from airlines to sports -- on sports games, etc., that really emphasize how special it is to be able to travel and to have experiences that open your mind, if you will. And so, it's been a really concentrated reminder to the -- to our consumers of how special travel is. And that new campaign has generated incredible response from all the different customers and media touch points. Yeah, sure. It's very similar to what we've talked about before, which is that clearly, the OTAs have gained share as a result of special corporate being down on a relative basis. But we're still seeing that our digital channels are gaining share faster than the OTAs. So, while -- I'd say the OTAs are probably now at about 14% of total bookings. You still remember that our direct channels are over 76% and about half of that is coming through the digital channel. So, we're very pleased to see that digital continues to gain share very nicely. Our mobile app downloads have grown really well. So, the OTAs have been an important driver of business for us during this pandemic, but I think from a share perspective, we're continuing to see the same trends we've been seeing. Sure. A couple of things. On the G&A front, I think certainly you have to take into consideration what's going on with wage and benefit inflation. And then I think as we get back to more fully loaded RevPAR numbers in the system, I think you should expect that for the next year anyway, that it'll be a little bit higher than just inflation as we get the organization back to full operations.  But again, I still think that you're looking at overall levels of G&A reflecting the significant work that we did in 2020 to rebuild Marriott so that it still will be meaningfully lower than the kind of guidance that we gave at the beginning of 2020, which was $950 to $960 million. Similarly, as you ask about -- what was your other question that you asked about, Stephen? Yeah, for EBITDA and RevPAR. Yes, I think it will be the same except perhaps a little bit bigger, as we have more and more owned lease profits coming back as well as IMF coming back. If you remember, pre -pandemic, we were close to $50 million per point of RevPAR. We're obviously getting hopefully closer to $40 million and that's obviously hotel-related RevPAR. The non-RevPAR will tie much more into both the residential fees as well as the credit card fees, but it should expand. Although, I think again in 2022, it will still be closer to the $40 million in 2022 and then again continue to grow from there. Absolutely, absolutely a gradual build. You're right. It absolutely takes a while to get going. And I would add, we are not hearing from our owners that it's universally 20%. There may be a couple of markets here and there where that could be happening in a particular situation, but broadly speaking, while it's clearly meaningfully higher than it was back in '18 and '19, I would say 20% is not the norm. And the only other thing I'll say is that while ADR is still not back to 2019 levels, traditionally in our business, we have been able to see that ADR tends to be able to hold onto inflation that we've seen ADR increases that at least inflation, if not higher. And while clearly at the moment we're not back there yet, that should be helpful as well. Good morning. Sure. So, first of all, similar messages to what you've heard before, which maintaining our investment-grade credit rating is a top priority for Marriott. We do want to continue to get our credit ratios back to the 3 to 3.5 times levels of debt-to-EBITDA. We are really pleased with the progress that we're making in that regard, probably happened faster than we might have imagined a year ago. And so, with that in mind, we are feeling increasingly confident that we'll be able to turn to returning capital to shareholders, perhaps with continued progress in the recovery in the back half of 2022.  When we think about the mix of dividends versus share repurchases, I think it's instructive to look at what we did in the great recession, which is that we -- as we move closer and closer to that 3 times to 3.5 times range, we reinstituted a modest, a smaller than -- smaller than it was before cash dividend and then returned to the normal level of cash dividend before we began share repurchases. And Tony and I will be talking about that to the board and continuing to have a dialog, but I don't think that that's a pretty good framework for you to consider as we move forward.  I think from a rationale, David, I think one of the things we really like about the 3 to 3.5 times level for us is the flexibility then it then gives us when we see an opportunistic investment come our way. And so, we do want to return to that area knowing that when those come up, we want to be able to take advantage of them. And in that regard, re-establishing that policy and those levels, I think is where we're headed. Sure. I think as a reminder, over time the idea is that is essentially net neutral to the Company, i.e., these are cost reimbursements without a profit component. And the timing of the revenues and the expenses can obviously vary. Just to your point, as you look at what's happened this year, you have seen that the gap has narrowed between the net reimbursed revenue line, and that's really a reflection of loyalty.  When you think about last year, far fewer redemptions were taking place and we had lowered our administrative costs in the loyalty program to take into consideration the much lower RevPAR that we had in the system. So naturally, that has come back to a higher level this year as -- and redemption have also grown meaningfully. But again, I think over time, you'll continue to see some variation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. But over time, the general direction is net neutral to the Company. Morning Bill. Are you there Bill function on your phone. Morning. First of all, as we talked about, the smaller and medium-sized business transient has been relatively stronger, and that, to your point, is more likely to be in secondary and tertiary markets. However, during Q3, we saw the best improvement in our big cities in special corporate that we've seen since the pandemic. So, I think it is absolutely moving in the right direction, including those larger cities. And one reminder is that -- is I'm sure you know all too well; we typically do not have an owner's priority on our IMF there. And so, the IMF actually behaves very similarly to base fees. Hey, Dori. Good morning. No, it's fine. As we've talked about before, a couple of things: 1. is that we did talk about how some construction starts have pushed forward a little bit, and so that would then impact some of when the key money goes out the door. But probably more importantly and larger is we just really are able to refine the amount of CapEX that we're going to spend on system CapEX as well as the Company's new headquarters building. And when you put those together, you get the reduction that we described today in the press release. Morning. No, not at all. Actually, it was a -- it was not a contract investment. This was an initiative for some international hotels that we had begun in 2019 related to operational improvements in some international hotels. But as a result of COVID and all that is going on in those hotels, it no longer makes sense to carry forward with that. So, the investment that we had put on our books to date needed to be written off. It was actually a program initiative of the Company for the hotels, it was not related to a hotel contract. No. No, actually as you know, very often we have programs that we do for our hotels that they reimburse us for. And in some cases, we actually develop the programs and over time, the hotel owners pay us back. And in this case, we had begun work on the program and invested some funds to develop the program and decided once COVID came, it no longer made sense to implement that program at the hotels and have them repay us over time, so we wrote off the investment. Yeah, sure. I think when you look overall at the business, it is traditionally the case that you have lower business overall. Again, I think interestingly, I actually expect leisure could continue to strengthen because when you think about coming out of the pandemic, increasingly people are feeling comfortable traveling where we see festive bookings in places like CALA, etc., its great demand, and the holidays are pacing up well compared to 2019, so I think we're very encouraged.  But the overall message we were trying to impart is that typically, it is a period just with family holidays, etc. that it is a lower occupancy quarter. And it's worth mentioning that when you go back to 2019 and '18 levels and you look at our EBITDA in Q3 and Q4 as we talked about in our comments, that typically Q3 is a higher RevPAR -driving quarter than Q4 typically."

RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of June 30, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic premise. People love to travel and to stay in our hotels. Demand grew steadily throughout the second quarter. Worldwide occupancy gained 6 percentage points in the month of June, compared to May and top 55%. Average daily rate in June was down only 13% from June two years ago. As a result, global RevPAR has risen meaningfully and swiftly from the depths of the pandemic when RevPAR was down 90% to down just 38% in June compared to the same month in 2019. Recovery timelines vary by region, given uneven vaccination trends, virus case loads and travel restrictions. Yet we remain encouraged by the incredible resilience of travel demand, demonstrated by the rapid return of guests in areas where rules have been eased and people feel they can travel safely. This can be seen most keenly in Mainland China, the first major market where RevPAR has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. RevPAR in the second quarter was driven by very strong demand, resulting in ADR exceeding 2019 levels. Occupancy reached 71% in April and 68% in May, before dipping to roughly 60% in June, due to small COVID outbreaks and strict lock downs in certain markets. Demand recovered quickly once the restrictions were lifted, as we have seen throughout the last year, July RevPAR is again expected to exceed 2019 levels. Perhaps most encouragingly, in April, for the first time since the pandemic began, leisure transient, business transient and group room nights in Mainland China were all ahead of 2019 levels. This is especially impressive given the absence of international arrivals, excuse me, due to stringent border restrictions. The U.S. and Canada accounts for roughly two-thirds of our rooms, and in this region, lodging demand grew impressively during the quarter, led by increasingly strong leisure demand, as the number of vaccinated people continued to rise. U.S. leisure room nights in the second quarter were 15% higher than in the second quarter of 2019, though we are seeing more blending of trip purpose, with the more flexible work-from-home or anywhere trend. Total U.S. occupancy reached over 63% in June, with ADR down just 11% versus June of 2019. Our strong momentum has continued into the first three and a half weeks of July. With U.S. occupancy reaching 67% and ADR down only 2% compared to July of 2019. July RevPAR for this period was down around 16% versus July of 2019. The U.S. is also seeing increasing signs of recovery in both special corporate and group demand. While special corporate booking levels in the first three and a half weeks of July are still down around 45% compared to the same period in 2019. We are optimistic that we have turned a corner. U.S. special corporate bookings rose 23% in June over May and then rose another 27% in the first three and a half weeks of July, as compared to the first three and a half weeks of June, with improvement widespread across industries and lengthening booking windows. Many of our corporate customers are telling us they are beginning to get back on the road this summer and we expect to see a step up in business travel post-Labor Day, as children go back to in-person learning and workers increasingly returned to the office. Group bookings in the U.S. have also gained momentum. U.S. group bookings made for all future dates were down 29% in June, compared to those made in June of 2019, a large improvement from down 56% in March of 2021 versus March of 2019. And for the first time since the pandemic started, group bookings made in the month of June or any time in 2021 exceeded in-the-year bookings made in the same month of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group revenue pace versus 2019 was down 31% for the fourth quarter of this year, improving to down 21% for the first quarter of 2022 and then down 12% for the second quarter of 2022. However, it\u2019s still early, and we expect bookings made closer to the event date will increase group revenue on the books for these time periods. Most importantly, our sales team is holding on to average daily rate. ADR for group bookings is almost flat for the fourth quarter and 3% higher for full year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2019. In other regions of the world, demand in the second quarter improved over the first quarter in the Middle East and Africa, in the Caribbean and Latin America, and in Europe. Middle East, Africa is benefiting from relatively high vaccination rates in many countries in the Middle East. Occupancy strengthened to 47% in June, largely driven by staycations in the UAE and quarantine business. Occupancy in Caribbean and Latin America improved meaningfully during the quarter, rising to 45% in June, while urban destinations continue to struggle, given slow vaccination rates and high COVID case counts, many of our resort properties in the Caribbean and Mexico are flourishing as they benefit from easing international travel restrictions and their close proximity to the U.S. Europe\u2019s recovery is still lagging, given its heavy reliance on international guests, slower border reopenings and shifting restrictions that change on short notice. Yet, with the EU easing many travel restrictions beginning in May and an increasing number of hotels reopening, occupancy doubled in just three months, reaching 31% in June. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, stalled in the second quarter as countries such as Japan, India, South Korea and Australia imposed strict lockdowns in response to sharp rises in Delta variant cases and low vaccination rates. Encouragingly, the recovery is now picking up steam again as caseloads in some countries like India have started to decline. Shifting to the development front, our pipeline stood at nearly 478,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter. Openings were strong, with nearly 25,000 rooms added to our system during the quarter and deal signings were also healthy. Additionally, less than 2% of rooms fell out of the pipeline, one of the lowest levels we have seen in the last three years. We are very pleased with our momentum around conversions as well. Conversions accounted for 26% of rooms added in the first half of this year and have been a meaningful contributor to signings. We continue to have the largest pipeline of global rooms under construction. We are also seeing great momentum around our branded residential business, with a record 18 residential properties expected to open during the year. For the full year, we expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to approximately 6% and with more visibility into anticipated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth to be towards the higher end of our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. As a reminder, this estimate includes the 100-basis-point headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust hotels that left our system earlier this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on replacing those hotels with new products. We are now in conversations for 80% of those locations, with signed or approved deals for nearly 20%. We continue to enhance and expand Marriott Bonvoy into an immersive travel platform that includes multiple products and offerings that enable us to provide value to our members beyond hotel stays. The program grew to over 153 million members at the end of the quarter. Homes & Villas by Marriott International or, which currently has around 35,000 whole home listings, has been an attractive offering and tool for engaging with members throughout the pandemic. With nearly 40% of listings in markets where we don\u2019t have distribution, HVMI is expanding the number of destination options for our guests. Over 90% of HVMI room nights in the quarter were booked by Bonvoy members. Our co-branded credit card holders were very active in the second quarter, with global card spending surpassing the same period in 2019. Global card acquisitions were also strong, reaching 2019 levels. Our recent credit card launches in South Korea and Mexico have seen strong initial interest from consumers in those markets. The South Korean card issuer, Shinhan Financial Group, touted the launch of our card as one of the most successful premium card launches they have ever had. Our total co-brand credit card fees in the second quarter surpassed those in the same quarter of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. We have also been very pleased with our successful Uber collaboration in the U.S. The number of members linking their accounts to-date has far exceeded our expectations. Activated accounts were already averaging six transactions in just the first 10 weeks, demonstrating our ability to drive real engagement with our Marriott Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay. We are always working on innovative ways to enhance our guests\u2019 full travel experience. Just last week, we became the first major hotel company to provide U.S.-based customers with the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Guests can now buy travel insurance when they make a reservation through Marriott\u2019s website or mobile app by linking to approved products sold by Alliance partners. As part of this distribution agreement, Marriott will earn commissions from Alliance. In another effort to connect with Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay, we are piloting a program that allows members to earn and redeem points at food and beverage outlets in select hotels, even if the member is not staying in the hotel. The program is currently in over 200 outlets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, with expansion to over 500 outlets expected by the end of the year. We also remain keenly focused on engaging with another key constituency, our owner and franchisee community. We have worked closely with them throughout the pandemic to help lower costs significantly. With some meaningful improvement in demand, profitability for many hotel owners accelerated in the second quarter. As the recovery continues, we are aligning with our owners and franchisees to balance two important goals as we think about our path forward, maximizing hotel level cash flow and driving great guest experiences, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. We are also working to address the labor challenges we are seeing, mainly in the U.S. in markets such as Southern Florida, Texas and Arizona, where demand has rebounded quickly. To that end, we are increasing our social and targeted marketing of Marriott as a best employer with career advancement opportunities, as well as holding job fairs to reach qualified candidates. Hiring tools, including onetime sign-on bonuses and temporary incentives, sometimes in combination with base salary adjustments in select markets are also being successfully employed. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank our amazing team of associates around the world. I have spent time in Los Angeles, Miami and New York over the last couple of weeks as I have been getting back on the road again. It has been wonderful to visit our hotels and to meet with so many of our associates and see firsthand their passion and resilience. These have been challenging times, but we are looking forward with optimism. While the time line is uncertain, I am confident that our business will fully recover and continue to grow from there. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our second quarter results reflected the strong pace of the global recovery and the incredible resilience of our business model. Worldwide occupancy came in at 51%, a significant increase of 13 percentage points over the first quarter of this year. We also saw a meaningful improvement in our average daily rate decline versus pre-pandemic levels, with ADR down 17% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. We are optimistic that rate recovery will occur faster than in prior downturns, when ADR gains lagged occupancy gains. It\u2019s been very encouraging to see that in Mainland China ADR has come back in tandem with demand. Elsewhere, ADR has also been particularly strong in areas where occupancy has rebounded quickly, in Aruba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, over half of our 28 luxury and upper upscale comparable resorts saw record high ADRs for the month of June. In the rest of the U.S., robust demand across our 34 comparable luxury resorts drove ADR for those hotels, up more than 40% above June 2019 levels. Demand in Greece rose quickly after travel restrictions were eased in April, leading to a 20% premium in ADR for the quarter versus the same period in 2019. Global RevPAR declined 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, a more than 15-percentage-point improvement compared to the first quarter RevPAR decline versus the 2019 first quarter. We recorded gross fee revenues of $642 million in the second quarter. Our non-RevPAR related fees again proved to be quite resilient. Totaling $160 million in the second quarter, these fees have now fully recovered to second quarter of 2019 levels. Our residential branding fees were strong again this quarter at $14 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $55 million in the quarter. Almost half of our IMFs were earned in Asia-Pacific, mostly from hotels in Mainland China. Around 30% of our IMFs were earned in the U.S. and Canada region, with a number of U.S. luxury hotels generating more incentive fees than in the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter G&A and other expense was 18% lower than in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of our significant restructuring activities undertaken last year. We had a tax benefit of $41 million in the quarter due to releasing $118 million of reserves related to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. We continue to believe that going forward our core tax rate will be around 22% to 24%, absent any legislative changes to corporate tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $558 million, which included $22 million of German Government support for certain of our leased and joint venture hotels. I also want to highlight the sale of the Prince Anita\u2019s [ph] St. Regis in the quarter, a joint venture in which we held a minority interest. It\u2019s encouraging to see transactions like this occurring and we expect to receive a total of at least $36 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. We will continue to operate the hotel under a long-term management agreement. At the hotel level, our numerous cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts have significantly lowered breakeven occupancy levels around the world, even further than we anticipated when the pandemic got underway. As a result of these efforts, as well as the strong recovery progress, the financial condition of many of our owners and franchisees continues to strengthen, as does our accounts receivable collections performance. Over 95% of our managed comp hotels in Mainland China had positive gross operating profit or GOP in the second quarter. Our GOP margin for managed comp hotels in this region expanded over 200 basis points versus margins in the second quarter of 2019. The strong margin expansion exemplifies the beneficial impact of our recent cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts, given operations have fully come back in Mainland China with the recovery and demand. These results also reflect our strong topline performance, driven by meaningful share gains in the region, thanks to our strong distribution, especially in the valuable luxury space, our popular brands and our powerful loyalty platform. In the U.S., the number of managed hotels with positive GOP improved significantly in the quarter as demand increased. Approximately 90% reported positive GOP in the second quarter, up from about 60% just one quarter ago. As occupancies increase, we are working closely with our hotel owners around the world to balance maximizing hotel profitability, while also driving guest satisfaction. We are being thoughtful about how and whether to bring back costs, programs and amenities that were reduced or eliminated, as we navigated the depth of the pandemic. For example, we have already reinstated accountability for our intent to recommend scores with accountable brand standard audits resuming next year. We also introduced a new set of renovation rules, which will allow for additional deferrals of some renovations, as well as reduced scopes for certain properties. We are considering how best to evolve housekeeping brand standards across each of our hotel brand tiers while ensuring guest expectations are met. We do believe that once business has fully recovered and operations are fully backed, there will be permanent areas of margin improvement, primarily related to our productivity enhancements and the increased use of contactless technologies such as mobile check-in and mobile key. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, while we are keeping a close eye on variant strains, we are optimistic about the continued global recovery. Our momentum has continued into July, and we expect an uptick in business travel this fall. We expect that when improved ease of international travel occurs that will also fuel further recovery in lodging demand. While there\u2019s still too much uncertainty to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, I\u2019d like to provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the topline, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 to be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong co-brand credit card fees and robust fees from our branded resident sales. We still expect full year G&A to be roughly $800 million, significantly lower than in 2019 and interest expense is still anticipated to be around $430 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $325 million to $350 million. A key component of cash flow is the loyalty program. With an acceleration of leisure demand, we have continued to see redemption nights\u2019 pick up nicely, especially in our resort destination. We remain focused on carefully controlling Bonvoy program administrative costs and we still anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to expect that cash flows from loyalty overall could be modestly negative. With better visibility and our continued disciplined approach to investment spending, we are lowering the top end of our full year investment spending expectation and narrowing the range to $575 million to $625 million. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. We are focused on bringing our credit statistics back in line with our historically strong investment-grade levels. Our leverage ratios continue to improve, as Marriott\u2019s asset-light business model is showing its resilient cash flow characteristics. We expect continued improvements in cash flow generation as the recovery progresses. I also want to add my appreciation for our incredible team of global associates who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They truly exemplify the Marriott spirit to serve and take care culture. In closing, we could not be more pleased with our progress in the quarter and we look forward to the continued return of guests to our 7,800 hotels around the world. We are happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with BoA.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was\u2026\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning, Tony. I was wondering if we could just talk a little bit about the development environment. I was just hoping you can give us a little bit more color, obviously it looks like the NUG increase was primarily driven by reduction in deletions. But maybe help us look out a little further, 2022, 2023. How are the conversations going and how do you think excluding the SBC component, the outlook has looked or changes versus maybe 90 days ago?\nTony Capuano: Of course. Thanks, Shaun. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver at the top end of our range in 2021. I think, when we look at factors like the number of rooms we have under construction, more than 200,000 rooms, the lowest fallout we have seen from the pipeline in about three years, the accelerated pace of conversions, we are increasingly optimistic that we can get back to a mid single-digit net unit growth pace. But as you have seen with some of the data coming out of STR around the slowdown in U.S. construction starts, the reality is the impact of those reduced construction starts will make it challenging for us to get back to that mid single-digit level over the next year or two.\nShaun Kelley: Tony, just as the follow-up to mid single-digit being more of a medium-term target, but just for the next year or two construction starts probably limiting maybe a little bit below that range. Is that the way to think about it?\nTony Capuano: Yeah. I think that\u2019s right. I think we are guiding to about 3.5% net unit growth, excluding the impact of SVC in 2021, and then 2022 and 2023 will be the years that we think will be impacted by that drop in construction start activity in the U.S.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: Your next question\u2026\nLeeny Oberg: Shaun, just one follow-up and that\u2019s that we do believe that, while we are constrained by these lower construction starts that the industry has seen in the U.S., that we are going to be able to offset some of this through conversions and we are really pleased with the pace of conversion signings and the conversations that we are seeing on that front. Hard to be specific at this point about exactly where that leaves us, but that, again, as Tony said, we are confident about getting back to the mid single-digit rooms growth rate.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nJoe Greff: Just one the -- you touched on this a little bit in terms of the labor challenges and labor costs going up. So when we look at the 2Q results and we are looking at your reported results, is there a lag in sort of the operating cost structure, particularly with labor relative to the revenue recovery? Is the exit rate coming out of the 2Q in cost structure, is that something that\u2019s more significant than the reported results because of potential add?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, as you know, that\u2019s going to overwhelmingly show up in IMF, Joe, from a standpoint of kind of the way that the quarter\u2019s operating profit works at the hotels. So, and as you might imagine, with owners\u2019 priorities in the U.S., we didn\u2019t have a very high percentage of hotels earning incentive fees yet. The biggest growth in incentive fees was in Asia-Pacific, and frankly, the labor cost pressures are much, much lower there. So, honestly, I don\u2019t think that there is a meaningful impact at all relative to the really rapid increase in occupancy that then necessitated that we get our employment levels in the hotels up as quickly as possible, and as you said, I think, there is a little bit of a lag there. But I don\u2019t think it had any sort of impact on the profits for the quarter.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you. And then, you mentioned, a group pace for the first quarter and second quarter of maybe you gave it and I missed it, but did you talk about full year 2022 pace?\nTony Capuano: Yes. The, sorry, Joe, the -- yeah, we talked a bit about 2022 pace and I think the -- there\u2019s a couple of encouraging things. When we look at booking pace, we continue to see volumes increasing pretty measurably into 2022, and maybe just as encouraging, if not more encouraging is the pace of ADR growth that we are seeing for 2022 bookings. In fact, if you look at group bookings beyond -- in 2022 and beyond, ADR is actually about 3% ahead of what we were booking back in 2020 for the following year. So the ADR pricing power that we are seeing in group in 2022 and beyond is very encouraging.\nJoe Greff: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Thanks. Just you have seen some really encouraging trends out of China. Can you just talk about like the pluses and minuses of using China as a comp, like how does your China business differ from kind of your global business? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: So, Thomas, it\u2019s a good question and I will say a couple of things. I think one of the things that is the most consistent in Greater China and the U.S. is the reality that the overwhelming percentage of travelers that stay at our hotels in those two regions are domestic. And so we are seeing -- obviously, you are seeing some of the same trends in the U.S. that we saw earlier in Mainland China, which is that when people feel comfortable to travel, the demand picks up really, really quickly, albeit with leisure being the strongest. And clearly, that is quite helpful for the hotel\u2019s occupancy levels, because they are not traveling outside their country. But I will say that, I think, the trends have been remarkably similar in terms of the pace of ADR recovery at the same time. And I think the other thing that I will point out that is interesting is that in Mainland China you do see markets, when they do have a pop in some COVID cases, they do shutdown demand very quickly, because the cities are closed down. We haven\u2019t obviously seen that same impact in the U.S., because the population is more varied in terms of kind of the travel and the way cities are shut down or not shut down. So in that regard, it\u2019s perhaps been a little bit more fluid in the U.S. But we have seen really terrific similarities in these markets where the occupancy is so much based on domestic travel. I think the other thing I will point out is that the F&B recovery in Greater China, I think, does point out the real strength of our hotel brands there, and that, I think, has been really impressive as well.\nThomas Allen: Thanks again. Just a quick follow-up, you mentioned RevPAR was down 16% in July versus 2019. Is that U.S. only or is that global, and if it\u2019s one of them, can you give us the other two?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes.\nTony Capuano: That\u2019s U.S. only.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah.\nThomas Allen: Do you have a global number?\nLeeny Oberg: We don\u2019t have.\nJackie Burka: Yeah.\nLeeny Oberg: No. We don\u2019t. And that was just for the first three and half weeks. Just to be clear, that wasn\u2019t for the month of July. As you know, this is all in real-time that we are pulling this together. So we don\u2019t have all those numbers quite yet, and again, as we said, that was for the U.S.\nThomas Allen: I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Thanks. I have a question about margins, but first, if I could just clarify Tony\u2019s comment about guidance for this year for unit growth at 3.5%. I thought I him say excluding the Service Properties Trust, but you meant including that, right?\nTony Capuano: Yeah. Sorry. That\u2019s right. So excluding the impact of our SVC, our guidance would be 4% to 4.5% and we guide to the high end of that. If you would account for the impact of those 88 SVC hotels, it would be 3% to 3.5% and we are guiding towards the high end of that range. That\u2019s correct. Sorry if I misspoke.\nRobin Farley: I just -- thanks. I just wanted to clarify that. And is the sort of higher end of the 3% to 3.5% range from fewer removals, is it a timing factor or in other words or were there properties that sort of were not maybe in compliance with brand standards that came back into compliance and won\u2019t be removed in 2021 or is it just that some of the removals are sort of pushed into 2022?\nTony Capuano: No. I think really, Robin, it\u2019s a byproduct of as the year advances, we have more and more visibility on both fronts, in terms of the timing of the individual openings and the status of projects going out -- potentially going out of the system.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then the margin clarification or question. Leeny you mentioned 200 basis points ahead of 2019. I think it was for -- in Greater China. And I think when you have talked about potential for margin improvement in the U.S. You have maybe sort of said you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect a big increase or a big change in the margin when RevPAR is recovered. Is that still the case? In other words, should we think about the -- some of the -- this sort of 200 basis points of margin in the example you used in China, is that kind of temporary maybe because brand standards aren\u2019t what they were in 2019 or I am just trying to square that with\u2026\nLeeny Oberg: Sure.\nRobin Farley: \u2026 sort of previous comments. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So a couple of things. First of all, I was speaking about Mainland China, and there, I think, the interesting thing is that, with RevPAR back to essentially similar levels in 2019, we are producing GOP margins that are 200 basis points better. So I think that shows you some of the work that we have been able to do on the cost management side and productivity enhancement side that would tell you that those are kind of good margins to think about going forward. I think in the U.S., Robin, the interesting thing here is that we have got a lot of those similar productivity and cost enhancements that we have done here, which would lead you to some similar sort of conclusions. I think the thing you have to think about is how quickly do labor costs and benefit cost increase. So as we talked about before, if ADR recovers really quickly, and you have got these productivity and cost enhancements in place, you have probably got a similar opportunity in the U.S. for those similar kinds of numbers that we talked about in Mainland China. But, again, a lot of this depends on how quickly it all comes back in the U.S. and also what\u2019s going on with wage rates and benefit costs.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nLeeny Oberg: Hi, Smedes\nSmedes Rose: Hi. How are you? I was just hoping you could give a little more color on the kind of the composition of the group improvement you are seeing in 2022, maybe any changes on a regional basis, maybe potentially away from larger, higher cost cities or if you are seeing anything just in terms of the kind of corporations or they tend to be smaller, is it larger? Maybe just some color on what you are seeing on any kind of forward bookings?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So as you know, group is a complex group of subsets of types of groups. Where we are seeing really significant acceleration is on social. In fact, in many ways, social group demand is largely back to pre-pandemic levels. We are not seeing rapid recovery in city-wide yet, the sort of big-box convention hotel city wides that we enjoyed pre-pandemic. And then the fall, I think, will be quite telling as we look for more conventional corporate group demand to return. The only other comment I might make\u2026\nSmedes Rose: Okay.\nTony Capuano: \u2026 Smedes is that, we are seeing in the year for the year group bookings stronger than what we have typically experienced in a pre-pandemic environment.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: You are welcome.\nSmedes Rose: And can I just ask just to kind of follow-up on the question about margin. As you guys make decisions around housekeeping, would that be kind of the key driver for potential margin improvement for owners is possible the elimination or significant reduction in housekeeping or are there other items on the table that would be very important towards potentially driving margin expansion at the property level?\nTony Capuano: Smedes, you can expect us to continue to try to strike the right balance between the expectations of our guests as they get back on the road and the financial realities that our owners and franchisees face. We will continue to be guided by guest preference and it is quite interesting when you read some of the verbatims that we hear from our guests. Some of our guests that are dipping their toes back into travel are still a bit hesitant about having housekeepers in the room and they appreciate the choice of housekeeping at their discretion. Others are vaccinated and feeling encouraged about the safety of travel and they would prefer a more conventional housekeeping solution. And so, I think, whether it\u2019s housekeeping protocols, whether it\u2019s food and beverage service, we will continue to evaluate and evolve those service levels by market and by quality tier around the world.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: You are welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, Tony and Leeny.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Hi, Stephen.\nStephen Grambling: Good morning. How are you?\nLeeny Oberg: Great.\nTony Capuano: Great.\nStephen Grambling: So you mentioned -- great, a number of things about the Bonvoy brand extensions and creating value there, as well as the strength of non-RevPAR related fees, including the credit card fees. How do you think about the growth of this segment going forward and how closely it\u2019s tied or not tied to kind of the core business, whether that\u2019s net unit growth or RevPAR going forward?\nLeeny Oberg: So just broadly speaking, the non-RevPAR fees, Stephen, are made up of kind of a variety of things. But the biggest chunk of them that make up -- again when you think about it going back to 2019, call it, $579 million, the biggest chunk is obviously the credit card. And that is going to overwhelmingly relate to both the number of cardholders and the amount they spend on their co-brand cards. And as we talked about today, their spending has actually gone back to 2019 levels, and you saw the similar thing happened to our co-brand fees. So I think both the power of Bonvoy combined with sort of general level of consumer spend and health of the economy, particularly obviously the U.S. and fees are overwhelmingly driven by the U.S. cardholders, is how you should think about that. I think you are going to continue to see outsized growth in our residential branding fees, although they are obviously meaningfully smaller. But timeshare fees is much more of a stable number because, as you know, those are overwhelmingly fixed. So I think the biggest driver is really how you think about consumer credit card spend on our co-brand cards.\nStephen Grambling: So, I guess, as a follow-up, is there an opportunity to monetize or generate credit card fees or other types of fees in the international markets where it hasn\u2019t been as much of a contributor?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So they are just -- they are meaningfully smaller depending on kind of the economic structure of the credit card business in those various countries. And obviously, the U.S. is a very, very large market. So, yes, we are, and we expect to continue to see increases in our international credit card co-brand card fees. And as we talked about in this insurance, travel insurance business that we are entering into, we should also be able to benefit there as well. But I would not expect them to be meaningful in terms of Marriott\u2019s overall earnings stream.\nStephen Grambling: Great. And if I can sneak one other follow-up on just on the IMF, you referenced that only a few North America kind of above that under priority level. Is there any kind of level of occupancy recovery or specific markets that we really need to see to start seeing those starts to be earned again?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, honestly, they range all over the map. Just to give you a sense, when you go back to 2019, we basically were in a position where our full service hotels about half of them were earning incentive fees, and overall, for the U.S., it was, call it, 56% when you take in our limited service and there you obviously had occupancies up into the 70s. But, otherwise, I will say it\u2019s a big mishmash depending on the specifics. The counter to that is as we described in Greater China, where we are at 77% earning in the year-to-date numbers for IMF and back in 2019, it was at 86%. So you can see that they behave much more in line with base fees, while in the U.S., you really have a ways to go before we back to earning meaningful incentive fees from the U.S.\nStephen Grambling: That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies.\nTony Capuano: Good morning, David.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a little longer term look, Leeny, and wonder what would have to happen and how you might be thinking about getting back into the capital returns game and whether we would have a shot at maybe recommending a dividend by the end of the year and how you might be thinking about the setup for these items next year, which is sort of what we are used to with Marriott?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. Absolutely. I think, as you pointed out, David, we are seeing tremendous progress. Our credit ratios are absolutely improving literally month-by-month and we are really pleased with the progress. First and foremost, we want to get our credit ratios back in line with being a strong investment-grade credit. That is the first priority and we are well on our way and so I do think we are going to be talking about capital return sooner rather than later. As you know, David, so much of this is around the pace of continued global vaccination rates, as well as restrictions on travel and consumers\u2019 comfort with travel, both domestically and internationally, as well as people returning to their offices, et cetera. So as we said, we can\u2019t predict and give you RevPAR and earnings outlooks in specifics. But if we continue to see really strong progress like we have been seeing, we could absolutely imagine that we are talking about capital return later on in 2022. Exactly when we are able to count on that and have a discussion with our Board on that topic remains to be seen. But you certainly can envision a scenario that, assuming things continue to progress, if that is the case.\nDavid Katz: If I can follow that up, three 3 times to 3.5 times was usually a target. Is there any qualification around that that we should be thinking about today?\nLeeny Oberg: No. Except to say that we, again, would want to feel like we are squarely staying there, i.e., that the market is -- the lodging recovery has stabilized, that things have gotten to a position where reaching that 3 times to 3.5 times is something that we foresee being very solid going forward. But think that other than that there\u2019s no additional constraints.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Thank you so much. Good luck.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nRichard Clarke: Just want to ask a quick question on the gap between your gross and net unit growth. I think you have done about 19,900 exits in the first half and if I look at the gap between your net unit growth that would imply you need to do about 15 -- a bit more than 15,000 exits in the second half. That\u2019s about double what you did in the second half of 2019 and actually even ahead of the exits you had in the second half of 2020. So is there anything in particular -- anything particular that\u2019s coming out there? Is it just conservative or anything you could mention on that?\nTony Capuano: No. I mean, I think, we continue to expect to see deletions for the full year in that 1% to 1.5% rate. They -- excluding the impact of SVC, obviously, in terms of baseline deletions, they tend to ebb and flow a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But on a full year basis, we are increasingly comfortable with that guidance of 1% to 1.5% deletions, excluding SVC.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. That makes sense. So are you saying that the deletions in Q2, the sort of 2,000 or so 2,500 exits, that\u2019s a particularly low number and there might be a bit of a catch-up from that in the second half?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. They do -- they are really quite variable during the year. You could have one quarter with 7,000. You could have one quarter with 1,000. So it\u2019s really it varies and we do look at this region by region very carefully and looking at expirations and how things are going. So it is -- continues to be, as Tony said, it continues to be our best estimate at this point. It is clearly better than where we were earlier in the year, because again, we had a wider range that we were considering, and we have been able to firm up that range so that we feel better to say that we will be in the space that says we would be at the top end of that 3% to 3.5% range. And I should add, part of the comfort around that is with the openings as well that we have greater visibility on the openings and we are extremely pleased with the openings in the second quarter and year-to-date.\nRichard Clarke: Wonderful. Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo.\nDori Kesten: Thanks for\u2026\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Hi, Dori.\nDori Kesten: Hey, Leeny. Given the trends that you have seen in new signings in opening schedule, when would you expect to see the pipeline resume quarter-over-quarter growth? I think in the last downturn you saw about six quarters of compression?\nTony Capuano: Yeah. Again, I might give a different version of the answer I just gave on deletions. The pipeline tends to ebb and flow a little bit. Some of the indicators we look at, development committee volume for instance and we are starting to see an acceleration in our volume of deals, particularly in June and July in our biggest markets, specifically in the U.S. and Canada and in China and I think that is encouraging for us. The other thing is, remember, more than 25% of our volume right now is in conversions and because of the quick turn on those conversions, often those get signed and opened and never even make their way into the pipeline. And so that adds to some of the quarter-to-quarter variability as well.\nDori Kesten: Okay. And can you just remind us what the difference is in fees between a -- between your pipeline that\u2019s luxury versus flex service on average?\nTony Capuano: Sorry. The difference in fees, you said?\nDori Kesten: Yeah. The -- like the long-term expectations of what a risk can own for you guys versus a residence?\nTony Capuano: Sure. I mean setting aside the fact that there can be pretty wide variations from market-to-market, the rule of thumb we have shared in the past is that a luxury hotel stabilized annual fees could be as much as 10 times the annual fees of a select-service hotel like a Fairfield Inn.\nDori Kesten: Okay. Thanks, Tony.\nTony Capuano: You are welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bellisario with Baird.\nTony Capuano: Good morning, Michael.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two part questions, I wanted to focus on Bonvoy. I am not sure you mentioned it, what was the occupancy contribution during the quarter? And then the bigger picture question, maybe just, how are you thinking about further broadening the platform and value proposition for guests? Is there any renewed interest in travel adjacencies, partnerships or any other brand holes in the portfolio -- the brand portfolio that you are seeing, really just kind of what are your plans to add more value for greater share of everyone\u2019s travel wallet today?\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, let me try to take both of those and Leeny may chime in as well. On your first question, Bonvoy penetration continues to recover. In Q2, we were almost 50%, 49.5% to be precise. That was a significant increase. We went as low as about 43% at the bottom of the pandemic. But it\u2019s still a couple of points shy of where we were pre-pandemic at about 52%. But the pace of penetration recovery, I think, is quite encouraging. And then on your second question, I think, we continue to look for opportunities to make the program stickier to engage with our customers even as they start to get back into travel and we tried to give you a few examples. I think the new travel insurance program is an example. The Uber partnership, I think, is a terrific example. The new branded credit cards are a good example. And then just the number of app downloads that we are seeing with the Marriott Bonvoy app. I think all of those point to our efforts and the, excuse me, the success of those efforts in trying to grow engagement among our Bonvoy members.\nMichael Bellisario: Helpful. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning, Vince.\nVince Ciepiel: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of mine have been answered, but one thing I am trying to get a little bit more clarity on, as it relates to your perspective, the trajectory of U.S. RevPAR. I think you mentioned in the first few weeks of July down only 16, ADR impressive only down 2. It sounds like leisure is really contributing nicely to that. I am just curious how you are thinking about the handoff through the second half from leisure into more corporate and group, and just how sustainable that July run rate is?\nTony Capuano: Well, certainly, the fall is going to be fascinating to watch, as more and more schools open for in-person learning, as more and more companies get back to the office. I think the data that is perhaps most telling from our perspective is some of the statistics we shared with you on special corporate bookings. As we mentioned, those bookings rose 23% in June as we compare to May. And then again, it\u2019s just the first three and half weeks of July, but we saw another 27% increase in those first three and half weeks of July versus the same three and half weeks in June. And so the magnitude and the steadiness of the growth in special corporate bookings I think is quite encouraging. And then you have heard us talk about this before, this blending of trip purpose continues to be a real and measurable phenomenon and we think it\u2019s good for our business and we think it will continue well beyond the end of the pandemic. With all that said, we will continue to be vigilant as we watch the pace of vaccinations around the world, the effectiveness of those vaccinations relative to the Delta variant and monitor the impacts of that on our business.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. And one follow-up, if I may, with that ADR number in July, I think the recovery in ADR has been progressing really nicely and probably better than a lot of folks thought going into this year. Curious what do you attribute that progress in ADR too and how sustainable do you think that is through the second half?\nTony Capuano: Well, we certainly look at the pace at which demand is recovering and the amount of pent-up demand is maybe best illustrated by the pricing power we are seeing in rate. We knew we would have that in leisure, but it\u2019s really encouraging to see that pricing power extend to both business transient and group. And in China, obviously, we have seen ADR come back at the same time and so you throw all that in the blender, it\u2019s really encouraging, and I think, it\u2019s just driven by the sheer volume of demand.\nLeeny Oberg: The only other thing I will add to that is the reality that so much of this depends on macroeconomic factors. And so as consumer confidence and consumer spending and general economic growth continue, that will be an important part of being able to continue to see this growth in demand and that has also -- always had an impact on how companies do their group bookings, do their business trips, et cetera, and that is another element of this price power.\nVince Ciepiel: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nTony Capuano: Good morning, Bill.\nBill Crow: Hi. Good morning. Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Hi, Bill.\nBill Crow: Good morning. First, a clarification, I think, it was Smedes had asked about 2022 group segmentation. And I think your answer was about -- it was largely a social with little evidence of city wides coming back, was that really more about 2021 or is that still 2022?\nLeeny Oberg: We will get Jackie to get back to you with super specific. But I think the reality, Bill, overall, if you are still seeing big chunks of association, corporate and government nights in 2022. But at the margin, where we are seeing the strongest kind of in the period, for the period demand is in both the smaller and medium-sized groups, as well as the social groups, where, in many cases, they have put off having events for a year and now coming forward. But, again, when we think about the big chunks of business, we have still got, I mean, you -- I am sure you have heard from Gaylord about their bookings. There\u2019s still a wide swath across all the big segments of group business for 2022. The other thing to point out is that we still are in a position where the room nights are -- the current pace for group is still down for 2022. It\u2019s just down a lot less than it used to be and that it also -- we are seeing strong rate, where rate is actually up compared to 2019. And with each progressing quarter, you see those nights improve as you move farther and farther away from Q3 of 2021, where there\u2019s still obviously some concern around these variants.\nBill Crow: Thanks for that clarification. If you will, my question that I really wanted to address is housekeeping and how are the guest requests for nightly housekeeping trending? We had heard from someone else that they had doubled over the last three months to six months, where the guests are proactively asking for that? And then, I guess, the second part of that is simply -- should we expect that the guest facing experience at luxury and upper upscale hotels will be very similar to where it was eventually in 2019, and therefore, the best opportunity for margin improvement on the housekeeping side might be at select service hotels? Is that a fair way to think about it?\nTony Capuano: Okay. Well, so there\u2019s a few questions embedded in there. I think, on your first question, the housekeeping protocols will really continue to be driven by guest preference and will likely vary as you kind of move up and down the quality tiers. On your second point, I think I tend to agree with you that in the luxury and upper upscale tier, I think that the expectation -- the guest expectations should be much more similar to what they saw in a pre-pandemic environment. And then on your third question, I am not sure I necessarily agree with that for the simple reason that what\u2019s driving margin. Certainly, there\u2019s the cost side, but there is the topline piece as well, and while it\u2019s a single data point, we saw over 4th of July weekend, U.S. resort ADR up about 10%. But if you carve out just the luxury tier -- Jackie has to keep me honest here, but I think we were up close to 35% in ADR and so at that sort of premium and rate, you should expect some meaningful margin improvement even if you are back to pre-pandemic service levels.\nBill Crow: Yeah. Perfect. Appreciate it. Thank you for your time.\nTony Capuano: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist.\nTony Capuano: Good morning, Patrick.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Hi. Good morning. One of the more controversial topics right now are -- is what percentage if any of business travel may be permanently lost, and certainly, a New York Times article yesterday throwing more fuel on that fire. I am wondering what your thoughts are around that question? Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Well, again, we have shared a bunch of data points with you today that I think underpin our optimism about the return of business transient demand. I do think going forward this blending of trip purpose that you have heard me talk about, we continue to think it\u2019s great for our business and our industry and we continue to think it\u2019s here to stay for quite a while. We are optimistic about the return of business travel. We talk to about 700 corporate travel managers every month and we are hearing anecdotally from our customers, particularly those that are in customer service businesses, law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, that it is critical to their business that they would be on the road and in-person with their customers. If anything going forward I do think it may be a bit more difficult to determine precisely looking at a guest walking through the lobby exactly what their trip purpose is. We are not asking you at the front desk are you here for business, are you here for leisure or both. But I do think you will see a lengthening of stay as a result of this blending of trip purposes. And in fact, that length of stay is measurable and we continue to see that through the second quarter of this year.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nTony Capuano: Of course. Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, again, thank you all for your participation and interest this morning. I hope you hear our optimism about the pace of recovery we are seeing in many markets around the world. We are excited ourselves to be back on the road. We hope you are getting out there as well and we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the weeks and months ahead. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with our second quarter results and the accelerating pace of the global recovery. The tremendous overall improvement we saw in both occupancy and rate in the quarter demonstrate a basic premise. People love to travel and to stay in our hotels. Demand grew steadily throughout the second quarter. Worldwide occupancy gained 6 percentage points in the month of June, compared to May and top 55%. Average daily rate in June was down only 13% from June two years ago. As a result, global RevPAR has risen meaningfully and swiftly from the depths of the pandemic when RevPAR was down 90% to down just 38% in June compared to the same month in 2019. Recovery timelines vary by region, given uneven vaccination trends, virus case loads and travel restrictions. Yet we remain encouraged by the incredible resilience of travel demand, demonstrated by the rapid return of guests in areas where rules have been eased and people feel they can travel safely. This can be seen most keenly in Mainland China, the first major market where RevPAR has recovered to pre-pandemic levels. RevPAR in the second quarter was driven by very strong demand, resulting in ADR exceeding 2019 levels. Occupancy reached 71% in April and 68% in May, before dipping to roughly 60% in June, due to small COVID outbreaks and strict lock downs in certain markets. Demand recovered quickly once the restrictions were lifted, as we have seen throughout the last year, July RevPAR is again expected to exceed 2019 levels. Perhaps most encouragingly, in April, for the first time since the pandemic began, leisure transient, business transient and group room nights in Mainland China were all ahead of 2019 levels. This is especially impressive given the absence of international arrivals, excuse me, due to stringent border restrictions. The U.S. and Canada accounts for roughly two-thirds of our rooms, and in this region, lodging demand grew impressively during the quarter, led by increasingly strong leisure demand, as the number of vaccinated people continued to rise. U.S. leisure room nights in the second quarter were 15% higher than in the second quarter of 2019, though we are seeing more blending of trip purpose, with the more flexible work-from-home or anywhere trend. Total U.S. occupancy reached over 63% in June, with ADR down just 11% versus June of 2019. Our strong momentum has continued into the first three and a half weeks of July. With U.S. occupancy reaching 67% and ADR down only 2% compared to July of 2019. July RevPAR for this period was down around 16% versus July of 2019. The U.S. is also seeing increasing signs of recovery in both special corporate and group demand. While special corporate booking levels in the first three and a half weeks of July are still down around 45% compared to the same period in 2019. We are optimistic that we have turned a corner. U.S. special corporate bookings rose 23% in June over May and then rose another 27% in the first three and a half weeks of July, as compared to the first three and a half weeks of June, with improvement widespread across industries and lengthening booking windows. Many of our corporate customers are telling us they are beginning to get back on the road this summer and we expect to see a step up in business travel post-Labor Day, as children go back to in-person learning and workers increasingly returned to the office. Group bookings in the U.S. have also gained momentum. U.S. group bookings made for all future dates were down 29% in June, compared to those made in June of 2019, a large improvement from down 56% in March of 2021 versus March of 2019. And for the first time since the pandemic started, group bookings made in the month of June or any time in 2021 exceeded in-the-year bookings made in the same month of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group revenue pace versus 2019 was down 31% for the fourth quarter of this year, improving to down 21% for the first quarter of 2022 and then down 12% for the second quarter of 2022. However, it's still early, and we expect bookings made closer to the event date will increase group revenue on the books for these time periods. Most importantly, our sales team is holding on to average daily rate. ADR for group bookings is almost flat for the fourth quarter and 3% higher for full year 2022 compared to the same periods in 2019. In other regions of the world, demand in the second quarter improved over the first quarter in the Middle East and Africa, in the Caribbean and Latin America, and in Europe. Middle East, Africa is benefiting from relatively high vaccination rates in many countries in the Middle East. Occupancy strengthened to 47% in June, largely driven by staycations in the UAE and quarantine business. Occupancy in Caribbean and Latin America improved meaningfully during the quarter, rising to 45% in June, while urban destinations continue to struggle, given slow vaccination rates and high COVID case counts, many of our resort properties in the Caribbean and Mexico are flourishing as they benefit from easing international travel restrictions and their close proximity to the U.S. Europe's recovery is still lagging, given its heavy reliance on international guests, slower border reopenings and shifting restrictions that change on short notice. Yet, with the EU easing many travel restrictions beginning in May and an increasing number of hotels reopening, occupancy doubled in just three months, reaching 31% in June. The recovery in Asia-Pacific, excluding China, stalled in the second quarter as countries such as Japan, India, South Korea and Australia imposed strict lockdowns in response to sharp rises in Delta variant cases and low vaccination rates. Encouragingly, the recovery is now picking up steam again as caseloads in some countries like India have started to decline. Shifting to the development front, our pipeline stood at nearly 478,000 rooms at the end of the second quarter. Openings were strong, with nearly 25,000 rooms added to our system during the quarter and deal signings were also healthy. Additionally, less than 2% of rooms fell out of the pipeline, one of the lowest levels we have seen in the last three years. We are very pleased with our momentum around conversions as well. Conversions accounted for 26% of rooms added in the first half of this year and have been a meaningful contributor to signings. We continue to have the largest pipeline of global rooms under construction. We are also seeing great momentum around our branded residential business, with a record 18 residential properties expected to open during the year. For the full year, we expect that gross rooms growth will accelerate to approximately 6% and with more visibility into anticipated full year deletions, we now expect 2021 net rooms growth to be towards the higher end of our previous expectation of 3% to 3.5%. As a reminder, this estimate includes the 100-basis-point headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust hotels that left our system earlier this year. We are pleased with the continued progress on replacing those hotels with new products. We are now in conversations for 80% of those locations, with signed or approved deals for nearly 20%. We continue to enhance and expand Marriott Bonvoy into an immersive travel platform that includes multiple products and offerings that enable us to provide value to our members beyond hotel stays. The program grew to over 153 million members at the end of the quarter. Homes & Villas by Marriott International or, which currently has around 35,000 whole home listings, has been an attractive offering and tool for engaging with members throughout the pandemic. With nearly 40% of listings in markets where we don't have distribution, HVMI is expanding the number of destination options for our guests. Over 90% of HVMI room nights in the quarter were booked by Bonvoy members. Our co-branded credit card holders were very active in the second quarter, with global card spending surpassing the same period in 2019. Global card acquisitions were also strong, reaching 2019 levels. Our recent credit card launches in South Korea and Mexico have seen strong initial interest from consumers in those markets. The South Korean card issuer, Shinhan Financial Group, touted the launch of our card as one of the most successful premium card launches they have ever had. Our total co-brand credit card fees in the second quarter surpassed those in the same quarter of 2019 for the first time since the pandemic began. We have also been very pleased with our successful Uber collaboration in the U.S. The number of members linking their accounts to-date has far exceeded our expectations. Activated accounts were already averaging six transactions in just the first 10 weeks, demonstrating our ability to drive real engagement with our Marriott Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay. We are always working on innovative ways to enhance our guests' full travel experience. Just last week, we became the first major hotel company to provide U.S.-based customers with the opportunity to purchase travel insurance. Guests can now buy travel insurance when they make a reservation through Marriott's website or mobile app by linking to approved products sold by Alliance partners. As part of this distribution agreement, Marriott will earn commissions from Alliance. In another effort to connect with Bonvoy members beyond the hotel stay, we are piloting a program that allows members to earn and redeem points at food and beverage outlets in select hotels, even if the member is not staying in the hotel. The program is currently in over 200 outlets in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, with expansion to over 500 outlets expected by the end of the year. We also remain keenly focused on engaging with another key constituency, our owner and franchisee community. We have worked closely with them throughout the pandemic to help lower costs significantly. With some meaningful improvement in demand, profitability for many hotel owners accelerated in the second quarter. As the recovery continues, we are aligning with our owners and franchisees to balance two important goals as we think about our path forward, maximizing hotel level cash flow and driving great guest experiences, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. We are also working to address the labor challenges we are seeing, mainly in the U.S. in markets such as Southern Florida, Texas and Arizona, where demand has rebounded quickly. To that end, we are increasing our social and targeted marketing of Marriott as a best employer with career advancement opportunities, as well as holding job fairs to reach qualified candidates. Hiring tools, including onetime sign-on bonuses and temporary incentives, sometimes in combination with base salary adjustments in select markets are also being successfully employed. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I want to thank our amazing team of associates around the world. I have spent time in Los Angeles, Miami and New York over the last couple of weeks as I have been getting back on the road again. It has been wonderful to visit our hotels and to meet with so many of our associates and see firsthand their passion and resilience. These have been challenging times, but we are looking forward with optimism. While the time line is uncertain, I am confident that our business will fully recover and continue to grow from there. Leeny? Good morning. Of course. Thanks, Shaun. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver at the top end of our range in 2021. I think, when we look at factors like the number of rooms we have under construction, more than 200,000 rooms, the lowest fallout we have seen from the pipeline in about three years, the accelerated pace of conversions, we are increasingly optimistic that we can get back to a mid single-digit net unit growth pace. But as you have seen with some of the data coming out of STR around the slowdown in U.S. construction starts, the reality is the impact of those reduced construction starts will make it challenging for us to get back to that mid single-digit level over the next year or two. Yeah. I think that's right. I think we are guiding to about 3.5% net unit growth, excluding the impact of SVC in 2021, and then 2022 and 2023 will be the years that we think will be impacted by that drop in construction start activity in the U.S. Of course. Good morning. Yes. The, sorry, Joe, the -- yeah, we talked a bit about 2022 pace and I think the -- there's a couple of encouraging things. When we look at booking pace, we continue to see volumes increasing pretty measurably into 2022, and maybe just as encouraging, if not more encouraging is the pace of ADR growth that we are seeing for 2022 bookings. In fact, if you look at group bookings beyond -- in 2022 and beyond, ADR is actually about 3% ahead of what we were booking back in 2020 for the following year. So the ADR pricing power that we are seeing in group in 2022 and beyond is very encouraging. That's U.S. only. Yeah. Sorry. That's right. So excluding the impact of our SVC, our guidance would be 4% to 4.5% and we guide to the high end of that. If you would account for the impact of those 88 SVC hotels, it would be 3% to 3.5% and we are guiding towards the high end of that range. That's correct. Sorry if I misspoke. No. I think really, Robin, it's a byproduct of as the year advances, we have more and more visibility on both fronts, in terms of the timing of the individual openings and the status of projects going out -- potentially going out of the system. Sure. So as you know, group is a complex group of subsets of types of groups. Where we are seeing really significant acceleration is on social. In fact, in many ways, social group demand is largely back to pre-pandemic levels. We are not seeing rapid recovery in city-wide yet, the sort of big-box convention hotel city wides that we enjoyed pre-pandemic. And then the fall, I think, will be quite telling as we look for more conventional corporate group demand to return. The only other comment I might make... ... Smedes is that, we are seeing in the year for the year group bookings stronger than what we have typically experienced in a pre-pandemic environment. You are welcome. Smedes, you can expect us to continue to try to strike the right balance between the expectations of our guests as they get back on the road and the financial realities that our owners and franchisees face. We will continue to be guided by guest preference and it is quite interesting when you read some of the verbatims that we hear from our guests. Some of our guests that are dipping their toes back into travel are still a bit hesitant about having housekeepers in the room and they appreciate the choice of housekeeping at their discretion. Others are vaccinated and feeling encouraged about the safety of travel and they would prefer a more conventional housekeeping solution. And so, I think, whether it's housekeeping protocols, whether it's food and beverage service, we will continue to evaluate and evolve those service levels by market and by quality tier around the world. You are welcome. Good morning. Great. Good morning, David. Good morning. No. I mean, I think, we continue to expect to see deletions for the full year in that 1% to 1.5% rate. They -- excluding the impact of SVC, obviously, in terms of baseline deletions, they tend to ebb and flow a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But on a full year basis, we are increasingly comfortable with that guidance of 1% to 1.5% deletions, excluding SVC. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. Again, I might give a different version of the answer I just gave on deletions. The pipeline tends to ebb and flow a little bit. Some of the indicators we look at, development committee volume for instance and we are starting to see an acceleration in our volume of deals, particularly in June and July in our biggest markets, specifically in the U.S. and Canada and in China and I think that is encouraging for us. The other thing is, remember, more than 25% of our volume right now is in conversions and because of the quick turn on those conversions, often those get signed and opened and never even make their way into the pipeline. And so that adds to some of the quarter-to-quarter variability as well. Sorry. The difference in fees, you said? Sure. I mean setting aside the fact that there can be pretty wide variations from market-to-market, the rule of thumb we have shared in the past is that a luxury hotel stabilized annual fees could be as much as 10 times the annual fees of a select-service hotel like a Fairfield Inn. You are welcome. Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Great. Well, let me try to take both of those and Leeny may chime in as well. On your first question, Bonvoy penetration continues to recover. In Q2, we were almost 50%, 49.5% to be precise. That was a significant increase. We went as low as about 43% at the bottom of the pandemic. But it's still a couple of points shy of where we were pre-pandemic at about 52%. But the pace of penetration recovery, I think, is quite encouraging. And then on your second question, I think, we continue to look for opportunities to make the program stickier to engage with our customers even as they start to get back into travel and we tried to give you a few examples. I think the new travel insurance program is an example. The Uber partnership, I think, is a terrific example. The new branded credit cards are a good example. And then just the number of app downloads that we are seeing with the Marriott Bonvoy app. I think all of those point to our efforts and the, excuse me, the success of those efforts in trying to grow engagement among our Bonvoy members. Of course. Thank you. Good morning. Well, certainly, the fall is going to be fascinating to watch, as more and more schools open for in-person learning, as more and more companies get back to the office. I think the data that is perhaps most telling from our perspective is some of the statistics we shared with you on special corporate bookings. As we mentioned, those bookings rose 23% in June as we compare to May. And then again, it's just the first three and half weeks of July, but we saw another 27% increase in those first three and half weeks of July versus the same three and half weeks in June. And so the magnitude and the steadiness of the growth in special corporate bookings I think is quite encouraging. And then you have heard us talk about this before, this blending of trip purpose continues to be a real and measurable phenomenon and we think it's good for our business and we think it will continue well beyond the end of the pandemic. With all that said, we will continue to be vigilant as we watch the pace of vaccinations around the world, the effectiveness of those vaccinations relative to the Delta variant and monitor the impacts of that on our business. Well, we certainly look at the pace at which demand is recovering and the amount of pent-up demand is maybe best illustrated by the pricing power we are seeing in rate. We knew we would have that in leisure, but it's really encouraging to see that pricing power extend to both business transient and group. And in China, obviously, we have seen ADR come back at the same time and so you throw all that in the blender, it's really encouraging, and I think, it's just driven by the sheer volume of demand. Good morning, Bill. Okay. Well, so there's a few questions embedded in there. I think, on your first question, the housekeeping protocols will really continue to be driven by guest preference and will likely vary as you kind of move up and down the quality tiers. On your second point, I think I tend to agree with you that in the luxury and upper upscale tier, I think that the expectation -- the guest expectations should be much more similar to what they saw in a pre-pandemic environment. And then on your third question, I am not sure I necessarily agree with that for the simple reason that what's driving margin. Certainly, there's the cost side, but there is the topline piece as well, and while it's a single data point, we saw over 4th of July weekend, U.S. resort ADR up about 10%. But if you carve out just the luxury tier -- Jackie has to keep me honest here, but I think we were up close to 35% in ADR and so at that sort of premium and rate, you should expect some meaningful margin improvement even if you are back to pre-pandemic service levels. Of course. Thank you. Good morning, Patrick. Well, again, we have shared a bunch of data points with you today that I think underpin our optimism about the return of business transient demand. I do think going forward this blending of trip purpose that you have heard me talk about, we continue to think it's great for our business and our industry and we continue to think it's here to stay for quite a while. We are optimistic about the return of business travel. We talk to about 700 corporate travel managers every month and we are hearing anecdotally from our customers, particularly those that are in customer service businesses, law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, that it is critical to their business that they would be on the road and in-person with their customers. If anything going forward I do think it may be a bit more difficult to determine precisely looking at a guest walking through the lobby exactly what their trip purpose is. We are not asking you at the front desk are you here for business, are you here for leisure or both. But I do think you will see a lengthening of stay as a result of this blending of trip purposes. And in fact, that length of stay is measurable and we continue to see that through the second quarter of this year. Of course. Thanks, Patrick. Great. Well, again, thank you all for your participation and interest this morning. I hope you hear our optimism about the pace of recovery we are seeing in many markets around the world. We are excited ourselves to be back on the road. We hope you are getting out there as well and we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the weeks and months ahead. Thanks and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our second quarter results reflected the strong pace of the global recovery and the incredible resilience of our business model. Worldwide occupancy came in at 51%, a significant increase of 13 percentage points over the first quarter of this year. We also saw a meaningful improvement in our average daily rate decline versus pre-pandemic levels, with ADR down 17% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2019. We are optimistic that rate recovery will occur faster than in prior downturns, when ADR gains lagged occupancy gains. It's been very encouraging to see that in Mainland China ADR has come back in tandem with demand. Elsewhere, ADR has also been particularly strong in areas where occupancy has rebounded quickly, in Aruba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, over half of our 28 luxury and upper upscale comparable resorts saw record high ADRs for the month of June. In the rest of the U.S., robust demand across our 34 comparable luxury resorts drove ADR for those hotels, up more than 40% above June 2019 levels. Demand in Greece rose quickly after travel restrictions were eased in April, leading to a 20% premium in ADR for the quarter versus the same period in 2019. Global RevPAR declined 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, a more than 15-percentage-point improvement compared to the first quarter RevPAR decline versus the 2019 first quarter. We recorded gross fee revenues of $642 million in the second quarter. Our non-RevPAR related fees again proved to be quite resilient. Totaling $160 million in the second quarter, these fees have now fully recovered to second quarter of 2019 levels. Our residential branding fees were strong again this quarter at $14 million. Incentive management fees or IMF totaled $55 million in the quarter. Almost half of our IMFs were earned in Asia-Pacific, mostly from hotels in Mainland China. Around 30% of our IMFs were earned in the U.S. and Canada region, with a number of U.S. luxury hotels generating more incentive fees than in the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter G&A and other expense was 18% lower than in the second quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of our significant restructuring activities undertaken last year. We had a tax benefit of $41 million in the quarter due to releasing $118 million of reserves related to the favorable resolution of pre-acquisition Starwood tax audit. We continue to believe that going forward our core tax rate will be around 22% to 24%, absent any legislative changes to corporate tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $558 million, which included $22 million of German Government support for certain of our leased and joint venture hotels. I also want to highlight the sale of the Prince Anita's [ph] St. Regis in the quarter, a joint venture in which we held a minority interest. It's encouraging to see transactions like this occurring and we expect to receive a total of at least $36 million in after-tax cash proceeds from the sale. We will continue to operate the hotel under a long-term management agreement. At the hotel level, our numerous cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts have significantly lowered breakeven occupancy levels around the world, even further than we anticipated when the pandemic got underway. As a result of these efforts, as well as the strong recovery progress, the financial condition of many of our owners and franchisees continues to strengthen, as does our accounts receivable collections performance. Over 95% of our managed comp hotels in Mainland China had positive gross operating profit or GOP in the second quarter. Our GOP margin for managed comp hotels in this region expanded over 200 basis points versus margins in the second quarter of 2019. The strong margin expansion exemplifies the beneficial impact of our recent cost reduction and productivity enhancement efforts, given operations have fully come back in Mainland China with the recovery and demand. These results also reflect our strong topline performance, driven by meaningful share gains in the region, thanks to our strong distribution, especially in the valuable luxury space, our popular brands and our powerful loyalty platform. In the U.S., the number of managed hotels with positive GOP improved significantly in the quarter as demand increased. Approximately 90% reported positive GOP in the second quarter, up from about 60% just one quarter ago. As occupancies increase, we are working closely with our hotel owners around the world to balance maximizing hotel profitability, while also driving guest satisfaction. We are being thoughtful about how and whether to bring back costs, programs and amenities that were reduced or eliminated, as we navigated the depth of the pandemic. For example, we have already reinstated accountability for our intent to recommend scores with accountable brand standard audits resuming next year. We also introduced a new set of renovation rules, which will allow for additional deferrals of some renovations, as well as reduced scopes for certain properties. We are considering how best to evolve housekeeping brand standards across each of our hotel brand tiers while ensuring guest expectations are met. We do believe that once business has fully recovered and operations are fully backed, there will be permanent areas of margin improvement, primarily related to our productivity enhancements and the increased use of contactless technologies such as mobile check-in and mobile key. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, while we are keeping a close eye on variant strains, we are optimistic about the continued global recovery. Our momentum has continued into July, and we expect an uptick in business travel this fall. We expect that when improved ease of international travel occurs that will also fuel further recovery in lodging demand. While there's still too much uncertainty to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance, I'd like to provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the topline, at current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1-point change in full year 2021 RevPAR versus 2019 to be $35 million to $40 million of fees. As we have seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to benefit from strong co-brand credit card fees and robust fees from our branded resident sales. We still expect full year G&A to be roughly $800 million, significantly lower than in 2019 and interest expense is still anticipated to be around $430 million. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $325 million to $350 million. A key component of cash flow is the loyalty program. With an acceleration of leisure demand, we have continued to see redemption nights' pick up nicely, especially in our resort destination. We remain focused on carefully controlling Bonvoy program administrative costs and we still anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, we continue to expect that cash flows from loyalty overall could be modestly negative. With better visibility and our continued disciplined approach to investment spending, we are lowering the top end of our full year investment spending expectation and narrowing the range to $575 million to $625 million. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs and other investing activities. We are focused on bringing our credit statistics back in line with our historically strong investment-grade levels. Our leverage ratios continue to improve, as Marriott's asset-light business model is showing its resilient cash flow characteristics. We expect continued improvements in cash flow generation as the recovery progresses. I also want to add my appreciation for our incredible team of global associates who have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. They truly exemplify the Marriott spirit to serve and take care culture. In closing, we could not be more pleased with our progress in the quarter and we look forward to the continued return of guests to our 7,800 hotels around the world. We are happy to take your questions. Operator? Shaun, just one follow-up and that's that we do believe that, while we are constrained by these lower construction starts that the industry has seen in the U.S., that we are going to be able to offset some of this through conversions and we are really pleased with the pace of conversion signings and the conversations that we are seeing on that front. Hard to be specific at this point about exactly where that leaves us, but that, again, as Tony said, we are confident about getting back to the mid single-digit rooms growth rate. Well, as you know, that's going to overwhelmingly show up in IMF, Joe, from a standpoint of kind of the way that the quarter's operating profit works at the hotels. So, and as you might imagine, with owners' priorities in the U.S., we didn't have a very high percentage of hotels earning incentive fees yet. The biggest growth in incentive fees was in Asia-Pacific, and frankly, the labor cost pressures are much, much lower there. So, honestly, I don't think that there is a meaningful impact at all relative to the really rapid increase in occupancy that then necessitated that we get our employment levels in the hotels up as quickly as possible, and as you said, I think, there is a little bit of a lag there. But I don't think it had any sort of impact on the profits for the quarter. So, Thomas, it's a good question and I will say a couple of things. I think one of the things that is the most consistent in Greater China and the U.S. is the reality that the overwhelming percentage of travelers that stay at our hotels in those two regions are domestic. And so we are seeing -- obviously, you are seeing some of the same trends in the U.S. that we saw earlier in Mainland China, which is that when people feel comfortable to travel, the demand picks up really, really quickly, albeit with leisure being the strongest. And clearly, that is quite helpful for the hotel's occupancy levels, because they are not traveling outside their country. But I will say that, I think, the trends have been remarkably similar in terms of the pace of ADR recovery at the same time. And I think the other thing that I will point out that is interesting is that in Mainland China you do see markets, when they do have a pop in some COVID cases, they do shutdown demand very quickly, because the cities are closed down. We haven't obviously seen that same impact in the U.S., because the population is more varied in terms of kind of the travel and the way cities are shut down or not shut down. So in that regard, it's perhaps been a little bit more fluid in the U.S. But we have seen really terrific similarities in these markets where the occupancy is so much based on domestic travel. I think the other thing I will point out is that the F&B recovery in Greater China, I think, does point out the real strength of our hotel brands there, and that, I think, has been really impressive as well. Yes. Yeah. We don't have. No. We don't. And that was just for the first three and half weeks. Just to be clear, that wasn't for the month of July. As you know, this is all in real-time that we are pulling this together. So we don't have all those numbers quite yet, and again, as we said, that was for the U.S. Sure. Sure. So a couple of things. First of all, I was speaking about Mainland China, and there, I think, the interesting thing is that, with RevPAR back to essentially similar levels in 2019, we are producing GOP margins that are 200 basis points better. So I think that shows you some of the work that we have been able to do on the cost management side and productivity enhancement side that would tell you that those are kind of good margins to think about going forward. I think in the U.S., Robin, the interesting thing here is that we have got a lot of those similar productivity and cost enhancements that we have done here, which would lead you to some similar sort of conclusions. I think the thing you have to think about is how quickly do labor costs and benefit cost increase. So as we talked about before, if ADR recovers really quickly, and you have got these productivity and cost enhancements in place, you have probably got a similar opportunity in the U.S. for those similar kinds of numbers that we talked about in Mainland China. But, again, a lot of this depends on how quickly it all comes back in the U.S. and also what's going on with wage rates and benefit costs. Hi, Smedes Hi, Stephen. Great. So just broadly speaking, the non-RevPAR fees, Stephen, are made up of kind of a variety of things. But the biggest chunk of them that make up -- again when you think about it going back to 2019, call it, $579 million, the biggest chunk is obviously the credit card. And that is going to overwhelmingly relate to both the number of cardholders and the amount they spend on their co-brand cards. And as we talked about today, their spending has actually gone back to 2019 levels, and you saw the similar thing happened to our co-brand fees. So I think both the power of Bonvoy combined with sort of general level of consumer spend and health of the economy, particularly obviously the U.S. and fees are overwhelmingly driven by the U.S. cardholders, is how you should think about that. I think you are going to continue to see outsized growth in our residential branding fees, although they are obviously meaningfully smaller. But timeshare fees is much more of a stable number because, as you know, those are overwhelmingly fixed. So I think the biggest driver is really how you think about consumer credit card spend on our co-brand cards. Yes. So they are just -- they are meaningfully smaller depending on kind of the economic structure of the credit card business in those various countries. And obviously, the U.S. is a very, very large market. So, yes, we are, and we expect to continue to see increases in our international credit card co-brand card fees. And as we talked about in this insurance, travel insurance business that we are entering into, we should also be able to benefit there as well. But I would not expect them to be meaningful in terms of Marriott's overall earnings stream. Well, honestly, they range all over the map. Just to give you a sense, when you go back to 2019, we basically were in a position where our full service hotels about half of them were earning incentive fees, and overall, for the U.S., it was, call it, 56% when you take in our limited service and there you obviously had occupancies up into the 70s. But, otherwise, I will say it's a big mishmash depending on the specifics. The counter to that is as we described in Greater China, where we are at 77% earning in the year-to-date numbers for IMF and back in 2019, it was at 86%. So you can see that they behave much more in line with base fees, while in the U.S., you really have a ways to go before we back to earning meaningful incentive fees from the U.S. Sure. Absolutely. I think, as you pointed out, David, we are seeing tremendous progress. Our credit ratios are absolutely improving literally month-by-month and we are really pleased with the progress. First and foremost, we want to get our credit ratios back in line with being a strong investment-grade credit. That is the first priority and we are well on our way and so I do think we are going to be talking about capital return sooner rather than later. As you know, David, so much of this is around the pace of continued global vaccination rates, as well as restrictions on travel and consumers' comfort with travel, both domestically and internationally, as well as people returning to their offices, et cetera. So as we said, we can't predict and give you RevPAR and earnings outlooks in specifics. But if we continue to see really strong progress like we have been seeing, we could absolutely imagine that we are talking about capital return later on in 2022. Exactly when we are able to count on that and have a discussion with our Board on that topic remains to be seen. But you certainly can envision a scenario that, assuming things continue to progress, if that is the case. No. Except to say that we, again, would want to feel like we are squarely staying there, i.e., that the market is -- the lodging recovery has stabilized, that things have gotten to a position where reaching that 3 times to 3.5 times is something that we foresee being very solid going forward. But think that other than that there's no additional constraints. Sure. Yeah. They do -- they are really quite variable during the year. You could have one quarter with 7,000. You could have one quarter with 1,000. So it's really it varies and we do look at this region by region very carefully and looking at expirations and how things are going. So it is -- continues to be, as Tony said, it continues to be our best estimate at this point. It is clearly better than where we were earlier in the year, because again, we had a wider range that we were considering, and we have been able to firm up that range so that we feel better to say that we will be in the space that says we would be at the top end of that 3% to 3.5% range. And I should add, part of the comfort around that is with the openings as well that we have greater visibility on the openings and we are extremely pleased with the openings in the second quarter and year-to-date. Hi, Dori. Good morning. Good morning, Vince. The only other thing I will add to that is the reality that so much of this depends on macroeconomic factors. And so as consumer confidence and consumer spending and general economic growth continue, that will be an important part of being able to continue to see this growth in demand and that has also -- always had an impact on how companies do their group bookings, do their business trips, et cetera, and that is another element of this price power. Hi, Bill. We will get Jackie to get back to you with super specific. But I think the reality, Bill, overall, if you are still seeing big chunks of association, corporate and government nights in 2022. But at the margin, where we are seeing the strongest kind of in the period, for the period demand is in both the smaller and medium-sized groups, as well as the social groups, where, in many cases, they have put off having events for a year and now coming forward. But, again, when we think about the big chunks of business, we have still got, I mean, you -- I am sure you have heard from Gaylord about their bookings. There's still a wide swath across all the big segments of group business for 2022. The other thing to point out is that we still are in a position where the room nights are -- the current pace for group is still down for 2022. It's just down a lot less than it used to be and that it also -- we are seeing strong rate, where rate is actually up compared to 2019. And with each progressing quarter, you see those nights improve as you move farther and farther away from Q3 of 2021, where there's still obviously some concern around these variants."

Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR, occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2021 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of March 31, 2021, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019, or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our investor relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie. As I enter my 26th year with Marriott, I\u2019m honored and humbled to be here this morning for my first earnings call as CEO. The senior leadership team and I have worked together for many years. We are all committed to building on our legacy and advancing the strategy we\u2019ve put in place to navigate the pandemic, drive towards recovery and grow our business. Global RevPAR is currently still substantially below pre-pandemic levels, and certain countries continue to experience concerning levels of COVID cases. Yet more and more people are getting vaccinated every day and demand is rebounding rapidly in some of our largest regions. Over 95% of our hotels are opened globally and we\u2019ve seen overall worldwide occupancy improve every month this year. In March, we saw the largest month over month sequential increase in global occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy reached over 45% up 9 percentage points from occupancy in February. March global RevPAR was down 53% compared to March of 2019, 8 percentage points better than February\u2019s decline. Global occupancy in April rose again to around 48%. RevPAR for April declined roughly 50% compared to the same month in 2019. We remained very encouraged by the strong recovery in Mainland China, while several markets were impacted by strict government mandated lockdowns in January and February of this year. Demand recovered quickly once COVID cases were under control and restrictions were relaxed. Occupancy in March was 66%, almost flat to the same time in 2019. Importantly, despite limited international travel into Mainland China, we saw robust demand from both leisure and business guests in March. Leisure transient room nights were above pre-pandemic levels for the third quarter in a row. Business transient room nights surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March, up 5% versus March 2019. While group room nights in March still trailed the same month in 2019 demand in this segment stepped up significantly after restrictions on large gatherings were lifted mid-month. Seeing these trends in Mainland China, running near pre-pandemic levels gives us confidence in strong full recoveries across all customer segments in other regions as conditions improve. We\u2019ve seen demand pick up quickly and meaningfully in countries with early and swift vaccine rollouts like the U.S., the UAE and Qatar, and in places where airlift has improved or travel restrictions have been relaxed like Mexico, Macau and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While room nights overall are still heavily weighted to leisure, the resilience of demand is clear, and whether it\u2019s from conversations with business leaders, customers, friends or family, we know there is a significant amount of pent-up demand for all types of travel given that so many trips had to be put on hold over the past year. For example, when the EU recently announced that they expect to be open to vaccinated U.S. travelers this summer, our reservation center saw an immediate surge in call volume. In the U.S., occupancy has increased swiftly this year with the acceleration of vaccine rollouts. In March, the U.S. and Canada region had the second highest occupancy behind Greater China at 49%. The domestic rebound is still being primarily led by leisure, transient demand. Special corporate and group bookings in the U.S. and Canada remain meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels, but are slowly recovering. In March, special corporate bookings for all future stays exceeded February\u2019s bookings by 25%, the largest sequential monthly increase in this customer segments since the pandemic began. And special corporate bookings took another nice leg up in April, improving 13% over March. Group bookings for the U.S. and Canada also continue to pick up as meeting planners are increasingly optimistic about the recovery and are feeling more confident that they can plan events, especially in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, group revenue on the books for 2022 was down less than 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels as compared to group revenue on the books as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 for 2020. Perhaps more importantly, rates for group room nights booked in the first quarter for 2022 and 2023 are currently 6% and 10% respectively above pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating that we are not trading rate for occupancy. Turning to other regions. Demand continues to improve in the Middle East and Africa. March occupancy reached 45% driven primarily by local leisure staycations, sporting events and room blocks for medical personnel related to vaccine rollouts. The recoveries across Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC, and the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA had been more uneven. In APAC, strong demand in Australia and the Maldives has been offset by rising COVID cases in other countries like India and Japan. In CALA, while many resort properties are enjoying strong demand, especially from U.S. leisure travelers, urban markets remain challenged. In Europe, given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries, 25% of the region\u2019s hotels are currently closed, and the recovery has been much more muted. Our marketing teams are employing localized and personalized marketing strategies that utilize our direct channels to help capture more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur. We are especially focused on leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and on enhancing the platform through new expanded collaborations that help make the program even stickier for 150 million members. Interacting with our members who are not yet ready to stay in a hotel has been a priority for us through the pandemic. Our co-branded credit card holders have been particularly engaged and new card holder acquisitions are improving as well. Helped by popular spending incentives, first quarter global credit card spending was down just 5% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to grow our global co-brand portfolio with the recent introduction of new cards in South Korea and in Mexico, bringing the total number of countries with co-brand cards to seven. The early results from these recent launches have been excellent and are a strong testament to the power of our brands and the Bonvoy platform in markets around the world. Another way Bonvoy members have been engaging with us is through the whole home rental platform Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI. While HVMI does not have a material impact on our financials, it is complementary to our portfolio of hotel brands. With roughly 30,000 listings it continues to grow and is a popular way for members to earn and redeem points. We also recently announced a new program with Uber, allowing members in the U.S. to earn loyalty points in high-frequency activities like ride hailing and food delivery. Early engagement for this program has been quite strong. The health and safety of our guests and associates is extremely important to us. We first rolled out our elevated cleanliness standards over a year ago. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to evolve our contactless experience and leverage technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key to help meet the changing needs of our guests, while also driving productivity. We are currently testing contactless arrival kiosks and contactless grab and go marketplaces at several select service properties across the U.S. as part of our efforts to further streamline our operations and enhance the guest experience. Over the past year, we\u2019ve ramped up engagement with our owner and franchisee community through multiple channels of communication. We\u2019ve worked very hard to help owners lower their costs and maximize hotel operating margins in this low occupancy environment. We continue to work closely to align on priorities as we navigate the recovery Together. Turning to development. Our pace of signings has picked up and is dramatically better than it was for much of last year. Our conversion activity was particularly strong in the quarter. As we talked about on our last call, in February we signed a conversion deal in CALA for approximately 7,000 all-inclusive rooms, positioning us to be a top 10 player in the popular and fast growing all-inclusive space. Given our impressive roster of conversion friendly brands and the meaningful benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system, we expect our momentum around conversions will continue. We added over 23,500 rooms to our system in the first quarter, 60% more than the first quarter of last year. 31% of the rooms added were from conversions, the highest percent in any quarter over the last six years. Looking ahead to the full year, we still expect gross rooms growth could accelerate to approximately 6% and net rooms growth could be roughly 3% to 3.5%. While we and the industry are still seeing some delays in construction starts, 45% of our industry leading pipeline of approximately 491,000 rooms is already under construction. Our net rooms growth expectation includes a one-time 100 basis points headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust or SVC hotels that left our system in the first quarter. We look forward to replacing the mostly limited-service first-generation SVC hotels with newer product, and are already in active discussions for new deals in nearly three quarters of the portfolios markets. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our financials in more detail, I want to say that our hearts are with everyone who has lost colleagues, friends, or family, because of COVID-19. We have all witnessed the devastation caused by this pandemic. And it\u2019s hard to see the alarmingly high number of COVID cases in too many countries today. I also want to recognize our amazing team of associates around the world, who have worked tirelessly through these uncertain times. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of their dedication, determination, and resilience during this crisis. They have redefined what it means to truly take care of each other and our guests. I do believe that Marriott will continue to see improving global trends and that we can all look ahead with real optimism. We are seeing wonderful signs that demand for travel is undeniably resilient. While some regions will recover faster than others, based on the progress we\u2019ve seen to date, I am confident that it is not a question of if demand will return to pre-COVID levels. It is really only a question of when? Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. We were pleased with the pace of continued recovery in our business during the first quarter, particularly in the U.S. In the first quarter, global occupancy was 38% and RevPAR declined 59% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and 46% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our gross fee revenues totaled $445 million for the quarter, down 29% compared to the year ago quarter. Franchise fees of $306 million declined only 26% year-over-year with our non-RevPAR related franchise fees proving to be particularly steady. They totaled $141 million in the first quarter, up slightly over the year ago quarter. Credit card branding fees were $81 million down only 12% year-over-year. We are also seeing strong performance in our branded residences business, where fees were $11 million higher than a year ago. Incentive management fees or IMS were $33 million in the quarter, around 45% of our IMS were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Greater China. In the first quarter, which has traditionally been the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, adjusted EBITDA was $296 million. G&A improved by 22% versus the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $50 million of lower bad debt expense, and $14 million of lower guarantee reserves. Expenses in the 2021 first quarter included $14 million of additional non-recurring executive compensation related to leadership changes. As Tony mentioned, we\u2019ve been working closely with our hotel owners to write five costs that our hotels given their low occupancy level. We are pleased that we\u2019ve been able to reduce hotel breakeven occupancy level significantly. Many of our initiatives to streamline operations and improve productivity such as more efficient management staffing levels at many of our managed hotels will remain in place after the pandemic and should help offset wage inflation. Additionally, we are currently assessing post-COVID renovation and brand standards with a view towards finding more ways to improve hotel profitability, while preserving the quality and experiences guests expect of our brands when they stay with us. While the operating environment has been quite challenging for more than a year, we\u2019ve been pleased that the vast majority of our hotels continue to pay their bills. We have even seen the number of hotels on payment plans come down meaningfully over the last several months, as occupancy has improved. Turning to our cash flow, even in this low RevPAR environment, cash provided by operating activities was $27 million in the quarter. That amount reflects in part the impact of roughly $90 million of reduced cash payment from the co-brand credit card companies. As you may remember, the company received $920 million of cash in May 2020 as part of amendments to our credit card agreement. And we will therefore see lower cash payments for the remainder of 2021 through 2023. If you add back that roughly $90 million and also deduct capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, and other investing activities of $39 million in the quarter. The company generated positive cash flows of around $78 million. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the strength of our cash generation throughout the pandemic. It\u2019s a clear reflection of our ability to quickly and effectively adapt our business and a real testament to the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the first quarter, our net liquidity improved to approximately $4.7 billion representing $600 million in available cash balances, plus $4.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we increased our weighted average debt maturity with a 10-year $1.1 billion bond issuance that has a 2.85% coupon and we also retired $750 million of senior note. As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 assuming continued progress with vaccinations and an improving consumer and macroeconomic environment in many regions around the world, we believe that the pace of the global recovery will continue to accelerate. While trends will vary by region, we expect overall leisure demand will strengthen further into the summer months. In the U.S. and Canada, reservations that our resort hotels are particularly strong, booked transient room nights per stays 30 days out or more are now over 60% above 2019 level. And on top of that, rates are almost 20% higher than 2019 level. Occupancy on the books for our resorts in the region is higher, relative to the same time in 2019 for every month through the end of the year. We believe transient \u2013 business transient and group will continue to slowly improve for now. And then business demand could really accelerate in the fall as more businesses reopened. With business transient returning faster than group, given the lead time, it\u2019s generally required for booking group business. As we think about the cadence of RevPAR recovery ADR is also a key factor. It\u2019s encouraging to see that where demand has rebounded swiftly ADR has come back quickly as well. In March, Mainland, the popular resort market in China achieved occupancy of 79% driving ADR 40% above 2019 levels and resulting in March RevPAR over 1.5 times higher than 2019 level. Here in the U.S., occupancy across our 34 luxury resorts rose to 69% in March, leading to ADR up 26% over March of 2019. Similarly, certain resort properties in Caribbean destinations, such as the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico saw record first quarter ADR as a result of sudden surges in occupancy. Well, we feel optimistic about the recovery trajectory ahead. There is still too much uncertainty about timing to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in RevPAR versus 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 RevPAR compared to 2020 could be more like $15 million to $20 million. As we have seen the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For us to start earning meaningful levels of IMS in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we still need to see significant improvement in RevPAR. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to show the impact of the improved credit card spending and strong fees from our branded residences. We now expect full year G&A to be at the top end of the range we shared last quarter are roughly $800 million primarily due to the additional non-recurring executive compensation associated with our recent changes in leadership and higher outside legal fees. This is significantly lower than G&A in 2019. And I\u2019ll also note that the cash component of G&A will be meaningfully below this range given non-cash stock compensation. Interest expense is still anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $300 million to $325 million. Another element related to our company\u2019s cash flow is the loyalty program. As leisure demand has accelerated and been particularly strong for our resort properties. We\u2019ve seen loyalty redemption nights\u2019 pickup nicely. We expect this trend could continue as our Bonvoy members are excited travel again. Even if redemptions do increase, given our focus on carefully controlling program administrative costs, we anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, cash flows from loyalty could be modestly negative. Our expectation for 2021 investment spending has not changed. Full year investment spending excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time. This would lead to total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. As a reminder, approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. In closing, we are pleased with our progress so far this year, and are increasingly confident that the pace of recovery will improve significantly from here. We hear from so many people who are eager to get back on the road and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests at our hotel. We\u2019ll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, guys. Tony, you\u2019re probably the best guy at Marriott to ask this question, given your background and development, but can you just talk about your medium term views on full service urban development in the U.S. and how long that takes to recover? And then maybe related to that, can you talk about, within the net rooms growth outlook for this year, if you want it to kind of break it out between \u2013 on a global basis between managed and franchise? That would be helpful to us. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Sure. Thanks, Joe. Well, as we\u2019ve said for a while, the fluidity at the markets makes it pretty tough for us to look much beyond the end of 2021. We continue to feel confident in the forecast we\u2019ve given you for 6% gross rooms growth through the end of 2021 and 3% to 3.5% net rooms growth, 4% to 4.5% percent, if you back out the one-time headwind from SVC. On the mix of full service versus limited service, maybe I would point to the current pipeline. So if you look at the current pipeline today, interestingly about 40% of the global pipeline is full service. And even within that 40%, 25% of those full service rooms are in the luxury tier. And I think that\u2019s quite encouraging for us. As you know, the fees coming out of a new luxury hotel can easily be 10 times that of a limited service hotel. And so I think we continue to focus certainly on the metric of gross and net rooms, because that\u2019s an important metric. But as you\u2019ve heard me, Joe say four years, looking at the composition of those rooms is every bit as important.\nLeeny Oberg: Next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning, everybody. Was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on some of the changes in brand standards that were mentioned. Obviously, it seems like some of this is here to stay, but also just wondering where you\u2019re at in that overall review process and sort of what does that mean for owners as we move into the kind of fall as occupancies pickup, because we\u2019ve definitely seen an explosion in margins for some hotel owners, but it seems like that\u2019s in part because they were still running on contingency plans a little bit, so just kind of curious on your comments?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure, absolutely. You\u2019re right. And this is obviously a pretty fluid situation. So the kind of the first part of this is around the dramatic changes that we made last year, which obviously cut down to the very bare bone of what we needed to do at hotel to manage with extraordinarily low levels of occupancy. But then as you\u2019ve seen demand pick back up, particularly in the resort hotels, we\u2019ve obviously added back meaningfully more in the way of services for our guests. But to your point, we\u2019ve also got the reality that guests also have their own views on what they feel comfortable with as it relates to housekeeping. And so we have made sure that there are choices for them to be able to \u2013 for example, in a luxury hotel, we continue to have daily housekeeping while if they are not comfortable with somebody coming in with their stay, then they can have that too. Our view is that we will continue to be looking at this really with an eye towards the occupancy in a variety of markets, where we are going to need to be flexible. But I do think by the end of the year, Shaun that we will have been able to make some decisions as we look forward about how we\u2019ll manage this \u2013 as occupancy really gets back closer to being normal. And in that regard, we do believe that there are some things that we can do to improve the productivity of the hotels. It obviously varies a lot by the tier. What is expected at a select service hotel is very different from a beach luxury hotel. But I do expect as we get into 2022 that we will have reestablished where we are on the brand standards. As you know, renovation is also a whole another topic. And there, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re taking into consideration that dramatically lower cash reserves that the hotel owners have and picking our spots and making sure that we\u2019re picking the renovation work that is critical to the customer experience.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Thomas, your line is open. If you\u2019re muted, please unmute.\nThomas Allen: Sorry, here I am. So, good morning. Leeny, could you just give us some more detail on the owned and leased segment performance there and how you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s going to recover through the year.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. You\u2019re right on the money in terms of the question about the variability there, Thomas. Just as a quick reminder, we\u2019ve got 66 owned or leased hotels of which 20 are owned. And I think it varies so much depending on what is going on in the occupancies of these various markets. So just to give you a sense Galla and Emiya are where we\u2019ve got really the toughest time for occupancy right now for our owned, leased hotels. And for that, if you think about the elegant acquisition where we had those hotels compared to a year ago in the first quarter, they obviously had a dramatic change in their profitability year-over-year in the first quarter and similarly in Europe. But at the same time, I think, in the U.S., what we\u2019re seeing is with the improved demand situation that those owned leased profits are in better shape. So broadly speaking, the other thing to remember is that, in the first quarter, we also had $17 million of termination fees, which actually helps owned and leased line. And that tends to be in a given year or something like, $45 million in that ballpark. So I think, if for better, for worse, is going to depend very much on what happens Galla as well as in Emiya to see these owned leased numbers rebound.\nThomas Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about when for the \u2013 in the U.S., for the group bookings and the corporate \u2013 maybe modest corporate pickup you\u2019ve seen so far. It sounds like no, because you mentioned higher rates. But just in general, do you think companies are concerned around increasing their travel budgets after having enjoyed a year of no travel and with high productivity evidently any kind of pushback or just kind of thoughts for getting around that?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So, I think, again \u2013 I think for all of us, we\u2019re all seeing that \u2013 the comfort people have around travel is now moving in the right direction. But there is still uncertainty. And as you\u2019ve got different vaccination rates in different part of the world and even within the U.S. at different rates in the U.S. there is still some concern around getting everyone together in a large group. But interestingly, what we see is that by the time you get to 2022, we really aren\u2019t seeing cancellations there. And frankly, even when you look at the pace between Q3 and Q4, you\u2019d see a notable difference. And when you look at the ADR in the U.S. for example, for system-wide, you\u2019re actually looking at ADR for group pace being up versus 2019, starting in Q3 of 2021, all the way through 2022. And overall revenue being, from a group pace standpoint, 20 points better in Q4 than it is in Q3. So we do believe by the time we get to 2022, there is a lot of pent up demand. And that from all that we hear from our corporate clients and association clients, that people are very anxious to be back in the groups, but whether that feels comfortable exactly in Q3 or exactly in Q4 is, where we do sense hesitancy. But that once you get past 2021 that there is a full expectation that people will be getting back into doing their group business.\nTony Capuano: And I think just to build on Leeny\u2019s point, the statistics I gave you on rates for the front of 2022 and 2023, I think really speaks to your concern about reluctance. The fact that in the first quarter of 2022, our rates are 6% higher than they were two years ago, and 10% for 2023, I think underscores Leeny\u2019s point that reluctance is fading as folks crave the ability to meet face to face.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. Two clarifications, one is, just on the group business, I know you were talking about the rates ahead in \u2013 starting in Q3. Did you say that total group nights for 2022, how that compares to pre-pandemic levels just in terms of the volume of nights?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. It\u2019s total room nights at this point are down 16%. Now this is on group pace. This is not on the books. This is just group kind of the group pace that we\u2019re seeing. And they were down 16% compared to 2019 levels on rooms as compared to this year down 62%. But again, it\u2019s early days, right? We\u2019ve only seen Q1. So I think part of this is the uncertainty I was pointing out that people are looking for just a little bit more clarity around, is it August? Is it October, when people are more comfortable having these large group meetings where everybody can be together.\nRobin Farley: And then and you said the down 16% was group pace, but not group room nights on the books. Is that a number you could kind of ballpark for us that for 2022?\nLeeny Oberg: For group room nights on the books at this point, we\u2019ll get back to you. I don\u2019t have anything specifically in front of me. I would guess again, at this point, it\u2019s down a bit more than that. As again, you would expect in the year for the year. Jackie or Betsy, if you have it?\nJackie Burka McConagha: In the U.S. and Canada, room nights are down 16% in 2022, right.\nLeeny Oberg: Right, that\u2019s pace.\nJackie Burka McConagha: Right. And then revenue for coming quarters.\nRobin Farley: Okay. So I can circle back later. And then maybe just one other clarification when you\u2019re guiding for the growth and net for the year, and just kind of looking at where Q1 came in, is there anything we should be keeping in mind about gross and net changes in the next couple of quarters? In other words, clearly, there would have been maybe some construction delays in 2020 that. So just thinking about, is there \u2013 are there quarters where the gross and net will not be as kind of consistent with the full year?\nTony Capuano: That\u2019s a good question, Robin. And again, it\u2019s a little hard to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I think what I would say to you is, we continue to see some construction delays around the world. But it\u2019s part of the reason, we\u2019re so encouraged by the first quarter\u2019s volume of conversion activity. Conversions will have been and will continue to be a significant priority for our transaction teams around the world. And I think it\u2019s in many ways, the one silver bullet we have to offset the impact of ongoing construction delays.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Robin, just to circle back, on the books was the minus 16% of room nights that I gave you, when we talked earlier. In terms of bookings for next year, when we look at in the quarter, we also there \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that the room nights are down 30%. If you\u2019re again, looking solely at what was booked in Q1, but from the group that is on the books for the moment for next year, it was the 16% room nights that I described earlier.\nRobin Farley: Okay. And those are both versus 2019. Is that Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. They are. We find that to be a better comparison.\nRobin Farley: No, absolutely. I just want to make sure. Okay, great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: One concern that \u2013 good morning, one concern that I have been hearing from hotel owners, including a one or more hotel REITs is regarding the automatic rebooking tools. These owners and REITs are feeling that the brands aren\u2019t doing enough in developing technology to prevent it, and they see these rebooking tools as a real resistance to increasing rates. Is there anything that you folks on your end can be doing to help with that? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: So I\u2019ll make one comment. I guess, I think the first thing is to look at where we did talk about some of our March numbers, which was when you saw that occupancy rebound dramatically, you also saw a rate respond extremely well and very dynamically. So our revenue management system is designed to be that dynamic. And we\u2019ve spent a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve paid a lot of attention to making sure that we adjust it for what has happened to business over the last year and a half. And so I think from our perspective, we\u2019re very pleased with what we see in terms of rate discipline, the group numbers that we talked to you about, what we\u2019ve seen on the special corporate side, which is that this year rates stayed essentially flat. So it is something that we\u2019re paying really close attention to and market by market is right. This is very much something that happens depending on exactly what\u2019s going on for a particular tier in a particular market. So we are very careful to be looking to make sure that as we see the pickup in demand that we\u2019re adjusting for rates extremely quickly.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Grambling of Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Grambling: Hi. Good morning. I may have missed this in the opening, but can you remind us of your capital allocation priorities, including how you might consider reinstating the dividend or buyback? And how do you think the pandemic has altered your view longer-term on the right balance there?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So as we talked about before, we are working quickly to get our leverage ratios back in line. We are still not there. We have a ways to go, as you think about our EBITDA, still being in the ballpark of down 60% to where it was before. And we are determined to through both suspending the cost, the cash management, as well as obviously stimulating demand to getting back there as quickly as we can. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to get there and hopefully sooner rather than later. When we think about capital return, I\u2019ll also point out that we have worked hard to extend our weighted average maturities on our debt over the past year and a half, which I think does put us in good position to be thinking about capital return. Once we get our leverage ratios back where we want them to be, I can\u2019t predict exactly when that will be. And I think when you ask about the question of, will we be keeping them at a different level? I think a lot of this does depend on how we see business coming back and the stability of it. So we will see when we get there, obviously discussions with our Board on that topic and continue to look forward to that conversation. But again, I\u2019m confident that we will be there before too long.\nSteven Grambling: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the notion around perspective inflation. Two-fold, one being the degree to which that may play into construction costs and have some impact on new constructions starting up again. And secondarily, we have an awful lot of discussions about labor costs across our coverage and the degree to which that is factoring into your thoughts today. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: So I\u2019ll start on the hotel margin side, and then Tony can talk about the development side. On the hotel margin side, as you\u2019ve heard us talk about before so much of how we hold onto these margins depends on how fast demand comes back, because we do believe that there\u2019s some work that we\u2019ve done that will permanently help keep some of this margin improvement. But obviously, depending on how long it takes for demand and ADR to come back, you\u2019ve obviously got annual wage inflation risks that start to cut against some of the savings that we\u2019ve come up with. So from that respect, we do watch really carefully. I\u2019d say roughly 50% of a full service cost structure is related to labor. And we are watching that very carefully. As we see demand come back and look at all the things that we\u2019ve done on the productivity side, but the pace there is very much around how quickly demand comes back. So far from what we can tell, we do like what we see in terms of the pop back on rate and feel good about our ability to hold on to some of these savings in a more permanent way. But obviously, wage inflation is something that we see. And frankly, it is typically been the case that when you have inflation on wages, you often also have inflation on ADR, which helps to offset that. On the development side, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Yes. I think the point we need just made is an important one, which is our owner and franchisee community look at both sides of that coin. We are seeing increases in construction costs both on the labor and materials side. But as you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, our owner community doesn\u2019t necessarily try to time the market based on cost factors in a given quarter. They tend to be long-term holders of these assets. And to Leeny\u2019s point, while they are appropriately aware of potential impact of inflation on wage rates they also embrace the historical impact of inflation on ADR growth.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Bellisario of Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Good morning, everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nMichael Bellisario: I was hoping you could provide some details on RevPAR index performance during the quarter. I don\u2019t think you provided any numbers. And then also just bigger pictures, seeing a little bit further out, where do you think system-wide index could normalize compared to pre-pandemic levels?\nTony Capuano: Both great questions. The challenge obviously is in this environment, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen an environment where RevPAR index numbers are less relevant. We look anecdotally at the way our hotels are ramping up and the preference that our guests continue to have for our brands. But as you know, we\u2019ve essentially \u2013 we\u2019ve been pleased with the momentum we saw coming into 2020 on the improvements of index. And we think when we get beyond the pandemic, we expect to pick up essentially right where we left off in terms of improvements in index across the portfolio.\nLeeny Oberg: Just as a reminder, index has done as you know, at the local level. So right now the index numbers can very often have hotels that is either not open or it\u2019s just opened. And so while frankly, the numbers may overwhelmingly looks really good, they also frankly, are not really a good, steady state view of how the hotel is doing because the demand is so volatile. So at this point we just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a number that is reflective of the real state of play for our hotels and our brands, but look forward to them getting back that way.\nMichael Bellisario: Got it. And can you provide where 2019 was for the portfolio?\nLeeny Oberg: We don\u2019t talk about specific numbers, but except to tell you that they were going up steadily across all the brands. And frankly, as we moved into 2020, what we saw in January and February moving into with some really powerful momentum as the full integration of our loyalty program and all of the systems was complete and really a strong set of movement across all the brands around the world on RevPAR index.\nMichael Bellisario: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your last question will come from the line of Richard Clarke of Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to follow-up on the 6% to 10% ADR uplift you were seeing in group. Is there anything behind that you called out in terms of mix? Is that helping? Is the U.S. recovering quicker there or different types of group? Or is this what you\u2019re charging? Are you charging up for this because of some of the new technology the clean promises that are being put in there? And then maybe any commentary on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of rates for business transient, as that comes back?\nTony Capuano: Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll take the group question and let Leeny take the BT question. Nothing particularly remarkable, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any dramatic difference in trends from region to region. I think as Leeny alluded to earlier, the strengths of our revenue management infrastructure really is allowing us to drive rate in the face of what is really encouraging upticks in demand for group. And that really \u2013 the demand for group is really kind of tracking the overall recovery REIT trends we\u2019ve seen by region across leisure NBT.\nLeeny Oberg: And on business transient, this again gets to \u2013 it\u2019s very market specific. So if somebody frankly needed to go and do business in Miami in the month of March or April, frankly, they were paying really strong rates. But in many markets, it\u2019s more of a reflection like a New York City or Chicago, where it was obviously lower. Special corporate kind of rates overall, though, in terms of our contracted rates with our corporate \u2013 large corporate clients, as you probably know, they actually rolled over in 2021 from 2020. So you see a pretty steady sort of pricing, while if you look at the last recession, they actually went down by 6%. So we\u2019ve been pleased to see them hold steady. I think obviously as we get into this fall, we\u2019ll see where that goes for 2022 because that\u2019s typically when we go out and renegotiate these rates for next year. But for this year, they\u2019ve held pretty steady.\nRichard Clarke: Wonderful. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nTony Capuano: Well, I want to thank you all again for joining us this morning and your continued interest in Marriott. As we said at the outset, we continue to be encouraged at the pace of recovery around the world and look forward to hopefully sharing more good news a quarter from now. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie. As I enter my 26th year with Marriott, I'm honored and humbled to be here this morning for my first earnings call as CEO. The senior leadership team and I have worked together for many years. We are all committed to building on our legacy and advancing the strategy we've put in place to navigate the pandemic, drive towards recovery and grow our business. Global RevPAR is currently still substantially below pre-pandemic levels, and certain countries continue to experience concerning levels of COVID cases. Yet more and more people are getting vaccinated every day and demand is rebounding rapidly in some of our largest regions. Over 95% of our hotels are opened globally and we've seen overall worldwide occupancy improve every month this year. In March, we saw the largest month over month sequential increase in global occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy reached over 45% up 9 percentage points from occupancy in February. March global RevPAR was down 53% compared to March of 2019, 8 percentage points better than February's decline. Global occupancy in April rose again to around 48%. RevPAR for April declined roughly 50% compared to the same month in 2019. We remained very encouraged by the strong recovery in Mainland China, while several markets were impacted by strict government mandated lockdowns in January and February of this year. Demand recovered quickly once COVID cases were under control and restrictions were relaxed. Occupancy in March was 66%, almost flat to the same time in 2019. Importantly, despite limited international travel into Mainland China, we saw robust demand from both leisure and business guests in March. Leisure transient room nights were above pre-pandemic levels for the third quarter in a row. Business transient room nights surpassed pre-pandemic levels in March, up 5% versus March 2019. While group room nights in March still trailed the same month in 2019 demand in this segment stepped up significantly after restrictions on large gatherings were lifted mid-month. Seeing these trends in Mainland China, running near pre-pandemic levels gives us confidence in strong full recoveries across all customer segments in other regions as conditions improve. We've seen demand pick up quickly and meaningfully in countries with early and swift vaccine rollouts like the U.S., the UAE and Qatar, and in places where airlift has improved or travel restrictions have been relaxed like Mexico, Macau and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While room nights overall are still heavily weighted to leisure, the resilience of demand is clear, and whether it's from conversations with business leaders, customers, friends or family, we know there is a significant amount of pent-up demand for all types of travel given that so many trips had to be put on hold over the past year. For example, when the EU recently announced that they expect to be open to vaccinated U.S. travelers this summer, our reservation center saw an immediate surge in call volume. In the U.S., occupancy has increased swiftly this year with the acceleration of vaccine rollouts. In March, the U.S. and Canada region had the second highest occupancy behind Greater China at 49%. The domestic rebound is still being primarily led by leisure, transient demand. Special corporate and group bookings in the U.S. and Canada remain meaningfully below pre-pandemic levels, but are slowly recovering. In March, special corporate bookings for all future stays exceeded February's bookings by 25%, the largest sequential monthly increase in this customer segments since the pandemic began. And special corporate bookings took another nice leg up in April, improving 13% over March. Group bookings for the U.S. and Canada also continue to pick up as meeting planners are increasingly optimistic about the recovery and are feeling more confident that they can plan events, especially in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the first quarter, group revenue on the books for 2022 was down less than 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels as compared to group revenue on the books as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 for 2020. Perhaps more importantly, rates for group room nights booked in the first quarter for 2022 and 2023 are currently 6% and 10% respectively above pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating that we are not trading rate for occupancy. Turning to other regions. Demand continues to improve in the Middle East and Africa. March occupancy reached 45% driven primarily by local leisure staycations, sporting events and room blocks for medical personnel related to vaccine rollouts. The recoveries across Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC, and the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA had been more uneven. In APAC, strong demand in Australia and the Maldives has been offset by rising COVID cases in other countries like India and Japan. In CALA, while many resort properties are enjoying strong demand, especially from U.S. leisure travelers, urban markets remain challenged. In Europe, given rising COVID cases and strict restrictions in many countries, 25% of the region's hotels are currently closed, and the recovery has been much more muted. Our marketing teams are employing localized and personalized marketing strategies that utilize our direct channels to help capture more leisure as well as leisure travel as the lines between work and home blur. We are especially focused on leveraging our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and on enhancing the platform through new expanded collaborations that help make the program even stickier for 150 million members. Interacting with our members who are not yet ready to stay in a hotel has been a priority for us through the pandemic. Our co-branded credit card holders have been particularly engaged and new card holder acquisitions are improving as well. Helped by popular spending incentives, first quarter global credit card spending was down just 5% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to grow our global co-brand portfolio with the recent introduction of new cards in South Korea and in Mexico, bringing the total number of countries with co-brand cards to seven. The early results from these recent launches have been excellent and are a strong testament to the power of our brands and the Bonvoy platform in markets around the world. Another way Bonvoy members have been engaging with us is through the whole home rental platform Homes & Villas by Marriott International or HVMI. While HVMI does not have a material impact on our financials, it is complementary to our portfolio of hotel brands. With roughly 30,000 listings it continues to grow and is a popular way for members to earn and redeem points. We also recently announced a new program with Uber, allowing members in the U.S. to earn loyalty points in high-frequency activities like ride hailing and food delivery. Early engagement for this program has been quite strong. The health and safety of our guests and associates is extremely important to us. We first rolled out our elevated cleanliness standards over a year ago. Since then, we've continued to evolve our contactless experience and leverage technologies such as mobile and web check-in and mobile key to help meet the changing needs of our guests, while also driving productivity. We are currently testing contactless arrival kiosks and contactless grab and go marketplaces at several select service properties across the U.S. as part of our efforts to further streamline our operations and enhance the guest experience. Over the past year, we've ramped up engagement with our owner and franchisee community through multiple channels of communication. We've worked very hard to help owners lower their costs and maximize hotel operating margins in this low occupancy environment. We continue to work closely to align on priorities as we navigate the recovery Together. Turning to development. Our pace of signings has picked up and is dramatically better than it was for much of last year. Our conversion activity was particularly strong in the quarter. As we talked about on our last call, in February we signed a conversion deal in CALA for approximately 7,000 all-inclusive rooms, positioning us to be a top 10 player in the popular and fast growing all-inclusive space. Given our impressive roster of conversion friendly brands and the meaningful benefits associated with being part of the Marriott system, we expect our momentum around conversions will continue. We added over 23,500 rooms to our system in the first quarter, 60% more than the first quarter of last year. 31% of the rooms added were from conversions, the highest percent in any quarter over the last six years. Looking ahead to the full year, we still expect gross rooms growth could accelerate to approximately 6% and net rooms growth could be roughly 3% to 3.5%. While we and the industry are still seeing some delays in construction starts, 45% of our industry leading pipeline of approximately 491,000 rooms is already under construction. Our net rooms growth expectation includes a one-time 100 basis points headwind from the 88 Service Properties Trust or SVC hotels that left our system in the first quarter. We look forward to replacing the mostly limited-service first-generation SVC hotels with newer product, and are already in active discussions for new deals in nearly three quarters of the portfolios markets. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to talk about our financials in more detail, I want to say that our hearts are with everyone who has lost colleagues, friends, or family, because of COVID-19. We have all witnessed the devastation caused by this pandemic. And it's hard to see the alarmingly high number of COVID cases in too many countries today. I also want to recognize our amazing team of associates around the world, who have worked tirelessly through these uncertain times. I couldn't be prouder of their dedication, determination, and resilience during this crisis. They have redefined what it means to truly take care of each other and our guests. I do believe that Marriott will continue to see improving global trends and that we can all look ahead with real optimism. We are seeing wonderful signs that demand for travel is undeniably resilient. While some regions will recover faster than others, based on the progress we've seen to date, I am confident that it is not a question of if demand will return to pre-COVID levels. It is really only a question of when? Leeny? Sure. Thanks, Joe. Well, as we've said for a while, the fluidity at the markets makes it pretty tough for us to look much beyond the end of 2021. We continue to feel confident in the forecast we've given you for 6% gross rooms growth through the end of 2021 and 3% to 3.5% net rooms growth, 4% to 4.5% percent, if you back out the one-time headwind from SVC. On the mix of full service versus limited service, maybe I would point to the current pipeline. So if you look at the current pipeline today, interestingly about 40% of the global pipeline is full service. And even within that 40%, 25% of those full service rooms are in the luxury tier. And I think that's quite encouraging for us. As you know, the fees coming out of a new luxury hotel can easily be 10 times that of a limited service hotel. And so I think we continue to focus certainly on the metric of gross and net rooms, because that's an important metric. But as you've heard me, Joe say four years, looking at the composition of those rooms is every bit as important. And I think just to build on Leeny's point, the statistics I gave you on rates for the front of 2022 and 2023, I think really speaks to your concern about reluctance. The fact that in the first quarter of 2022, our rates are 6% higher than they were two years ago, and 10% for 2023, I think underscores Leeny's point that reluctance is fading as folks crave the ability to meet face to face. That's a good question, Robin. And again, it's a little hard to forecast quarter-to-quarter. I think what I would say to you is, we continue to see some construction delays around the world. But it's part of the reason, we're so encouraged by the first quarter's volume of conversion activity. Conversions will have been and will continue to be a significant priority for our transaction teams around the world. And I think it's in many ways, the one silver bullet we have to offset the impact of ongoing construction delays. Thanks, Robin. Good morning. Yes. I think the point we need just made is an important one, which is our owner and franchisee community look at both sides of that coin. We are seeing increases in construction costs both on the labor and materials side. But as you've heard from us in the past, our owner community doesn't necessarily try to time the market based on cost factors in a given quarter. They tend to be long-term holders of these assets. And to Leeny's point, while they are appropriately aware of potential impact of inflation on wage rates they also embrace the historical impact of inflation on ADR growth. Good morning. Both great questions. The challenge obviously is in this environment, I'm not sure I've ever seen an environment where RevPAR index numbers are less relevant. We look anecdotally at the way our hotels are ramping up and the preference that our guests continue to have for our brands. But as you know, we've essentially \u2013 we've been pleased with the momentum we saw coming into 2020 on the improvements of index. And we think when we get beyond the pandemic, we expect to pick up essentially right where we left off in terms of improvements in index across the portfolio. Yes. Maybe I'll take the group question and let Leeny take the BT question. Nothing particularly remarkable, I don't think we're seeing any dramatic difference in trends from region to region. I think as Leeny alluded to earlier, the strengths of our revenue management infrastructure really is allowing us to drive rate in the face of what is really encouraging upticks in demand for group. And that really \u2013 the demand for group is really kind of tracking the overall recovery REIT trends we've seen by region across leisure NBT. Well, I want to thank you all again for joining us this morning and your continued interest in Marriott. As we said at the outset, we continue to be encouraged at the pace of recovery around the world and look forward to hopefully sharing more good news a quarter from now. Thank you."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. We were pleased with the pace of continued recovery in our business during the first quarter, particularly in the U.S. In the first quarter, global occupancy was 38% and RevPAR declined 59% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and 46% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our gross fee revenues totaled $445 million for the quarter, down 29% compared to the year ago quarter. Franchise fees of $306 million declined only 26% year-over-year with our non-RevPAR related franchise fees proving to be particularly steady. They totaled $141 million in the first quarter, up slightly over the year ago quarter. Credit card branding fees were $81 million down only 12% year-over-year. We are also seeing strong performance in our branded residences business, where fees were $11 million higher than a year ago. Incentive management fees or IMS were $33 million in the quarter, around 45% of our IMS were earned in Asia Pacific, mostly from hotels in Greater China. In the first quarter, which has traditionally been the seasonally lowest quarter of the year, adjusted EBITDA was $296 million. G&A improved by 22% versus the first quarter of last year, primarily due to $50 million of lower bad debt expense, and $14 million of lower guarantee reserves. Expenses in the 2021 first quarter included $14 million of additional non-recurring executive compensation related to leadership changes. As Tony mentioned, we've been working closely with our hotel owners to write five costs that our hotels given their low occupancy level. We are pleased that we've been able to reduce hotel breakeven occupancy level significantly. Many of our initiatives to streamline operations and improve productivity such as more efficient management staffing levels at many of our managed hotels will remain in place after the pandemic and should help offset wage inflation. Additionally, we are currently assessing post-COVID renovation and brand standards with a view towards finding more ways to improve hotel profitability, while preserving the quality and experiences guests expect of our brands when they stay with us. While the operating environment has been quite challenging for more than a year, we've been pleased that the vast majority of our hotels continue to pay their bills. We have even seen the number of hotels on payment plans come down meaningfully over the last several months, as occupancy has improved. Turning to our cash flow, even in this low RevPAR environment, cash provided by operating activities was $27 million in the quarter. That amount reflects in part the impact of roughly $90 million of reduced cash payment from the co-brand credit card companies. As you may remember, the company received $920 million of cash in May 2020 as part of amendments to our credit card agreement. And we will therefore see lower cash payments for the remainder of 2021 through 2023. If you add back that roughly $90 million and also deduct capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, and other investing activities of $39 million in the quarter. The company generated positive cash flows of around $78 million. We've been very pleased with the strength of our cash generation throughout the pandemic. It's a clear reflection of our ability to quickly and effectively adapt our business and a real testament to the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the first quarter, our net liquidity improved to approximately $4.7 billion representing $600 million in available cash balances, plus $4.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we increased our weighted average debt maturity with a 10-year $1.1 billion bond issuance that has a 2.85% coupon and we also retired $750 million of senior note. As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 assuming continued progress with vaccinations and an improving consumer and macroeconomic environment in many regions around the world, we believe that the pace of the global recovery will continue to accelerate. While trends will vary by region, we expect overall leisure demand will strengthen further into the summer months. In the U.S. and Canada, reservations that our resort hotels are particularly strong, booked transient room nights per stays 30 days out or more are now over 60% above 2019 level. And on top of that, rates are almost 20% higher than 2019 level. Occupancy on the books for our resorts in the region is higher, relative to the same time in 2019 for every month through the end of the year. We believe transient \u2013 business transient and group will continue to slowly improve for now. And then business demand could really accelerate in the fall as more businesses reopened. With business transient returning faster than group, given the lead time, it's generally required for booking group business. As we think about the cadence of RevPAR recovery ADR is also a key factor. It's encouraging to see that where demand has rebounded swiftly ADR has come back quickly as well. In March, Mainland, the popular resort market in China achieved occupancy of 79% driving ADR 40% above 2019 levels and resulting in March RevPAR over 1.5 times higher than 2019 level. Here in the U.S., occupancy across our 34 luxury resorts rose to 69% in March, leading to ADR up 26% over March of 2019. Similarly, certain resort properties in Caribbean destinations, such as the Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas and the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach in Puerto Rico saw record first quarter ADR as a result of sudden surges in occupancy. Well, we feel optimistic about the recovery trajectory ahead. There is still too much uncertainty about timing to be able to give specific RevPAR or earnings guidance. But I will again provide color on specific items where we do have some visibility. Starting with the top line at current RevPAR levels for full year 2021, we expect the sensitivity of a one point change in RevPAR versus 2019 RevPAR on our fees could be between $35 million and $40 million per year. Please note that given the nominal level of RevPAR in 2020, the impact of a one percentage point change in 2021 RevPAR compared to 2020 could be more like $15 million to $20 million. As we have seen the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For us to start earning meaningful levels of IMS in the U.S. and other markets where IMF stand aside to owner priorities, we still need to see significant improvement in RevPAR. We expect our non-RevPAR related fees to continue to show the impact of the improved credit card spending and strong fees from our branded residences. We now expect full year G&A to be at the top end of the range we shared last quarter are roughly $800 million primarily due to the additional non-recurring executive compensation associated with our recent changes in leadership and higher outside legal fees. This is significantly lower than G&A in 2019. And I'll also note that the cash component of G&A will be meaningfully below this range given non-cash stock compensation. Interest expense is still anticipated to be roughly $430 million for the full year. Full year cash taxes are now expected to be $300 million to $325 million. Another element related to our company's cash flow is the loyalty program. As leisure demand has accelerated and been particularly strong for our resort properties. We've seen loyalty redemption nights' pickup nicely. We expect this trend could continue as our Bonvoy members are excited travel again. Even if redemptions do increase, given our focus on carefully controlling program administrative costs, we anticipate that full year cash flows from the loyalty program could be positive before factoring in the reduced payments we will receive from the credit card companies. After factoring in these reduced payments, which are expected to effectively repay around one-third of the total $920 million we received in 2020, cash flows from loyalty could be modestly negative. Our expectation for 2021 investment spending has not changed. Full year investment spending excluding amounts expected to be reimbursed over time is anticipated to total $375 million to $450 million for the year. We anticipate another $200 million of investment spending that is expected to be reimbursed over time. This would lead to total investment spending of $575 million to $650 million as compared to $375 million in 2020. As a reminder, approximately $220 million of the total spending in 2021 is for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. Total investment spending includes capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities. In closing, we are pleased with our progress so far this year, and are increasingly confident that the pace of recovery will improve significantly from here. We hear from so many people who are eager to get back on the road and we look forward to welcoming more and more guests at our hotel. We'll now open the line for questions. Next question. Sure, absolutely. You're right. And this is obviously a pretty fluid situation. So the kind of the first part of this is around the dramatic changes that we made last year, which obviously cut down to the very bare bone of what we needed to do at hotel to manage with extraordinarily low levels of occupancy. But then as you've seen demand pick back up, particularly in the resort hotels, we've obviously added back meaningfully more in the way of services for our guests. But to your point, we've also got the reality that guests also have their own views on what they feel comfortable with as it relates to housekeeping. And so we have made sure that there are choices for them to be able to \u2013 for example, in a luxury hotel, we continue to have daily housekeeping while if they are not comfortable with somebody coming in with their stay, then they can have that too. Our view is that we will continue to be looking at this really with an eye towards the occupancy in a variety of markets, where we are going to need to be flexible. But I do think by the end of the year, Shaun that we will have been able to make some decisions as we look forward about how we'll manage this \u2013 as occupancy really gets back closer to being normal. And in that regard, we do believe that there are some things that we can do to improve the productivity of the hotels. It obviously varies a lot by the tier. What is expected at a select service hotel is very different from a beach luxury hotel. But I do expect as we get into 2022 that we will have reestablished where we are on the brand standards. As you know, renovation is also a whole another topic. And there, we've got to make sure that we're taking into consideration that dramatically lower cash reserves that the hotel owners have and picking our spots and making sure that we're picking the renovation work that is critical to the customer experience. Sure. You're right on the money in terms of the question about the variability there, Thomas. Just as a quick reminder, we've got 66 owned or leased hotels of which 20 are owned. And I think it varies so much depending on what is going on in the occupancies of these various markets. So just to give you a sense Galla and Emiya are where we've got really the toughest time for occupancy right now for our owned, leased hotels. And for that, if you think about the elegant acquisition where we had those hotels compared to a year ago in the first quarter, they obviously had a dramatic change in their profitability year-over-year in the first quarter and similarly in Europe. But at the same time, I think, in the U.S., what we're seeing is with the improved demand situation that those owned leased profits are in better shape. So broadly speaking, the other thing to remember is that, in the first quarter, we also had $17 million of termination fees, which actually helps owned and leased line. And that tends to be in a given year or something like, $45 million in that ballpark. So I think, if for better, for worse, is going to depend very much on what happens Galla as well as in Emiya to see these owned leased numbers rebound. Yes. So, I think, again \u2013 I think for all of us, we're all seeing that \u2013 the comfort people have around travel is now moving in the right direction. But there is still uncertainty. And as you've got different vaccination rates in different part of the world and even within the U.S. at different rates in the U.S. there is still some concern around getting everyone together in a large group. But interestingly, what we see is that by the time you get to 2022, we really aren't seeing cancellations there. And frankly, even when you look at the pace between Q3 and Q4, you'd see a notable difference. And when you look at the ADR in the U.S. for example, for system-wide, you're actually looking at ADR for group pace being up versus 2019, starting in Q3 of 2021, all the way through 2022. And overall revenue being, from a group pace standpoint, 20 points better in Q4 than it is in Q3. So we do believe by the time we get to 2022, there is a lot of pent up demand. And that from all that we hear from our corporate clients and association clients, that people are very anxious to be back in the groups, but whether that feels comfortable exactly in Q3 or exactly in Q4 is, where we do sense hesitancy. But that once you get past 2021 that there is a full expectation that people will be getting back into doing their group business. Yes. It's total room nights at this point are down 16%. Now this is on group pace. This is not on the books. This is just group kind of the group pace that we're seeing. And they were down 16% compared to 2019 levels on rooms as compared to this year down 62%. But again, it's early days, right? We've only seen Q1. So I think part of this is the uncertainty I was pointing out that people are looking for just a little bit more clarity around, is it August? Is it October, when people are more comfortable having these large group meetings where everybody can be together. For group room nights on the books at this point, we'll get back to you. I don't have anything specifically in front of me. I would guess again, at this point, it's down a bit more than that. As again, you would expect in the year for the year. Jackie or Betsy, if you have it? Right, that's pace. Robin, just to circle back, on the books was the minus 16% of room nights that I gave you, when we talked earlier. In terms of bookings for next year, when we look at in the quarter, we also there \u2013 we're seeing that the room nights are down 30%. If you're again, looking solely at what was booked in Q1, but from the group that is on the books for the moment for next year, it was the 16% room nights that I described earlier. Yes. They are. We find that to be a better comparison. So I'll make one comment. I guess, I think the first thing is to look at where we did talk about some of our March numbers, which was when you saw that occupancy rebound dramatically, you also saw a rate respond extremely well and very dynamically. So our revenue management system is designed to be that dynamic. And we've spent a lot \u2013 we've paid a lot of attention to making sure that we adjust it for what has happened to business over the last year and a half. And so I think from our perspective, we're very pleased with what we see in terms of rate discipline, the group numbers that we talked to you about, what we've seen on the special corporate side, which is that this year rates stayed essentially flat. So it is something that we're paying really close attention to and market by market is right. This is very much something that happens depending on exactly what's going on for a particular tier in a particular market. So we are very careful to be looking to make sure that as we see the pickup in demand that we're adjusting for rates extremely quickly. Sure. So as we talked about before, we are working quickly to get our leverage ratios back in line. We are still not there. We have a ways to go, as you think about our EBITDA, still being in the ballpark of down 60% to where it was before. And we are determined to through both suspending the cost, the cash management, as well as obviously stimulating demand to getting back there as quickly as we can. And we're confident that we're going to get there and hopefully sooner rather than later. When we think about capital return, I'll also point out that we have worked hard to extend our weighted average maturities on our debt over the past year and a half, which I think does put us in good position to be thinking about capital return. Once we get our leverage ratios back where we want them to be, I can't predict exactly when that will be. And I think when you ask about the question of, will we be keeping them at a different level? I think a lot of this does depend on how we see business coming back and the stability of it. So we will see when we get there, obviously discussions with our Board on that topic and continue to look forward to that conversation. But again, I'm confident that we will be there before too long. So I'll start on the hotel margin side, and then Tony can talk about the development side. On the hotel margin side, as you've heard us talk about before so much of how we hold onto these margins depends on how fast demand comes back, because we do believe that there's some work that we've done that will permanently help keep some of this margin improvement. But obviously, depending on how long it takes for demand and ADR to come back, you've obviously got annual wage inflation risks that start to cut against some of the savings that we've come up with. So from that respect, we do watch really carefully. I'd say roughly 50% of a full service cost structure is related to labor. And we are watching that very carefully. As we see demand come back and look at all the things that we've done on the productivity side, but the pace there is very much around how quickly demand comes back. So far from what we can tell, we do like what we see in terms of the pop back on rate and feel good about our ability to hold on to some of these savings in a more permanent way. But obviously, wage inflation is something that we see. And frankly, it is typically been the case that when you have inflation on wages, you often also have inflation on ADR, which helps to offset that. On the development side, I'll turn it over to Tony. Good morning. Just as a reminder, index has done as you know, at the local level. So right now the index numbers can very often have hotels that is either not open or it's just opened. And so while frankly, the numbers may overwhelmingly looks really good, they also frankly, are not really a good, steady state view of how the hotel is doing because the demand is so volatile. So at this point we just don't believe it's a number that is reflective of the real state of play for our hotels and our brands, but look forward to them getting back that way. We don't talk about specific numbers, but except to tell you that they were going up steadily across all the brands. And frankly, as we moved into 2020, what we saw in January and February moving into with some really powerful momentum as the full integration of our loyalty program and all of the systems was complete and really a strong set of movement across all the brands around the world on RevPAR index. And on business transient, this again gets to \u2013 it's very market specific. So if somebody frankly needed to go and do business in Miami in the month of March or April, frankly, they were paying really strong rates. But in many markets, it's more of a reflection like a New York City or Chicago, where it was obviously lower. Special corporate kind of rates overall, though, in terms of our contracted rates with our corporate \u2013 large corporate clients, as you probably know, they actually rolled over in 2021 from 2020. So you see a pretty steady sort of pricing, while if you look at the last recession, they actually went down by 6%. So we've been pleased to see them hold steady. I think obviously as we get into this fall, we'll see where that goes for 2022 because that's typically when we go out and renegotiate these rates for next year. But for this year, they've held pretty steady. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Ms. Jackie Burka.\nJackie Burka: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Marriott\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that, unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of December 31, 2022, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for Marriott. After achieving global RevPAR recovery in June, we finished the year on a real high note, with RevPAR versus 2019, up 7% in December and up 5% in the fourth quarter. Each quarter saw sequential improvement in global occupancy and ADR compared to 2019. We ended the year with fourth quarter occupancy down just 5 percentage points and ADR up 13%. With Asia-Pacific, excluding China, or APAC surpassing pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, all regions, except Greater China, have now more than fully recovered. It is abundantly clear that people love to travel. Globally, leisure demand has remained robust. In the fourth quarter, leisure transient room nights increased 7% versus 2019. And we continued driving leisure ADR, which rose 22%. Our group business experienced the most meaningful improvement in 2022. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter group revenues increased 10% above the same quarter in 2019. Group revenue for 2023 is already pacing up 20% year-over-year, with room night and rate gains each quarter. Given strong lead generation and increased rate quotes, especially for in-the-year, for-the-year bookings, we expect group revenues this year to strengthen further. In 2022, around half of group room nights were booked in the year compared to just one-third in 2019. U.S. and Canada business transient demand remained steady from the third to the fourth quarter at around 90% recovery. For 2023, we are pleased to have negotiated special corporate rate growth in the high single-digits after holding these rates steady the last 2 years. Our day-of-the-week trends in the U.S. and Canada continue to point to the blending of business and leisure trips. In the fourth quarter, midweek occupancy was still down mid single-digit percentage points versus 2019, while occupancy on shoulder and weekend nights was down the low single-digits. Additionally, the average length of a business transient trip in the U.S. has risen by more than 20% versus 2019. Rising cross-border travel also helped spur overall demand growth during the quarter, though we believe there is still further upside in 2023, especially now that China\u2019s borders have reopened. Guests traveling outside their home country accounted for 16% of transient room nights globally in the 2022 fourth quarter, 1 percentage point higher than the prior quarter, yet still 3 percentage points lower than 2019. With more than 177 million members, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program has also been a key driver of demand for our hotels and other lodging offerings and for adjacent products like our Bonvoy co-branded credit cards. Our growing portfolio of credit cards, now in 9 countries following our November card launch in Saudi Arabia, had record global card member acquisitions and card spend last year. Product innovation and engagement with our members remain key focus areas, especially through investments in our Marriott Bonvoy app and other digital products. We have made great gains in contributions from our digital platforms, which are highly profitable channels for our owners and anticipate many additional enhancements over the next couple of years. In 2022, our mobile app users were up 32% year-over-year, digital room nights rose 27%, and digital revenues climbed 41%. The financing environment for new projects and hotel sales remains challenging, especially here in the U.S. given higher interest rates and uncertainties surrounding a potential economic downturn. However, other industry headwinds like supply chain disruptions, construction costs and availability of labor have improved. Given strong local operating trends, overall developer sentiment improved in 2022 and we had another year of strong signing activity. Our global development team signed franchise and management agreements for nearly 108,000 rooms last year. In addition, upon the anticipated closing of the transaction, the City Express portfolio should add around 17,000 rooms in the moderately priced mid-scale space. We are excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region as well as in other locations around the world. We also recently announced Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, a new 1 to 3-bedroom serviced apartment brand that we plan to launch in the upper-upscale and luxury segments. We have already received a great deal of initial interests from owners and developers. Momentum in conversions continues, including in multi-property opportunities, thanks to the breadth of our roster of convergent-friendly brands across the chain scales. The meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our portfolio make these brands very attractive to owners. Conversions represented nearly 20% of room signings and 27% of room additions in 2022. We added a total of 394 properties last year, representing more than 65,000 rooms and grew our industry leading system 4.4% on a gross basis or 3.1% net year-over-year. Excluding the impact from our exit of Russia, our net rooms growth was 3.6%. For 2023, we are forecasting gross rooms growth of around 5.5%, including around 1 percentage point from the anticipated addition of the City Express rooms to our franchise system. Assuming deletions of 1% to 1.5%, net rooms could grow 4% to 4.5%. I\u2019d like to pivot now and share a few highlights of our recent ESG efforts. ESG is an integral part of our company\u2019s culture and strategy, and our company is dedicated to making a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. In June, we committed $50 million to support historically underrepresented groups in the journey to hotel ownership through our new program here in North America called Marriott\u2019s Bridging The Gap. This program should help us reach our goal of having at least 3,000 diverse and women-owned hotels in our system by 2025. In December, we announced that over 1 million Marriott associates have taken our human trafficking training, which we have also donated to the wider hospitality industries. In terms of workforce diversity and inclusion, our aim is to achieve global gender parity in the company\u2019s leadership by 2023 and have people of color hold 25% of U.S. executive positions by 2025. We also continue our work to set science-based emissions reduction targets, with more details expected to come later this year. I am proud of these accomplishments and all that we have achieved in 2022. As we look ahead to full year 2023, there is meaningful uncertainty about global economic growth. Lodging is a cyclical business and it\u2019s not immune to downturns in the macroeconomic environment. To-date, however, we have not seen signs of demand softening. Certainly, trends could change relatively quickly given our average transient booking window is around 3 weeks. But 1.5 months into 2023, booking demand and pricing remains strong. As Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we are optimistic that global RevPAR will grow year-over-year even if the global economy softens in the back half of this year. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I\u2019d like to thank our associates around the world for their hard work and commitment in navigating the last few challenging years and in helping the company achieve these record financial results. I also want to make a couple of statements regarding two of my senior team members. I am sure you saw the news in December that Stephanie Linnartz has been appointed Under Armour\u2019s new President and CEO, a role that she will assume at the end of this month. Also, after a 35-year career with Marriott that has spanned the globe, Craig Smith, our Group President, International, has informed me of his decision to retire from the company later this month. Craig has developed and mentored hundreds of hotel general managers and above property leaders around the world and has helped us meaningfully accelerate the growth of our international business. I want to thank both Stephanie and Craig for their decades of dedication and countless contributions to Marriott. While I will personally miss these two excellent senior executives, I am proud that we have such an incredibly deep management bench. I look forward to sharing more details about new leadership appointments soon. Now, let me turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. With sustained momentum in global RevPAR growth, we reported an outstanding quarter. Gross fees rose 16% and adjusted EBITDA climbed 21% over the 2019 fourth quarter. For the full year, we posted record fees, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, despite the Omicron variant causing a slow start to the year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR versus 2019 accelerated nicely from the third quarter in every region, except Greater China. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 5%, aided by 11% growth in ADR. RevPAR in the region versus 2019 improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter across all market types, from primary to tertiary and all brand tiers, from luxury to select service. International RevPAR rose 3% above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, driven by improvements in the comparison to 2019 for both rate and occupancy. In the Middle East and Africa, or MEA, RevPAR grew 44%, boosted by the World Cup in Qatar. RevPAR increased 28% in CALA, 7% in Europe and 6% in Asia-Pacific, except for China. While results in Greater China were, again, impacted by lockdowns in the fourth quarter, the region reached a major milestone with the new open border policy and the lifting of quarantine requirements in January. It could take time to increase airline capacity and work-through passport and visa requests, but we are optimistic about meaningful RevPAR recovery in the region as these issues abate. We saw a huge demand surge in January during the Chinese New Year holiday, with RevPAR for the holiday period nearly in line with 2019. Other regions are also anticipated to benefit from an increase in outbound China travel, especially APAC, where over 40% of room nights in 2019 came from Chinese travelers. In the fourth quarter, total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. Those fees rose 16% year-over-year to $215 million, driven largely by our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, rose impressively in the quarter, reaching $186 million. IMF surpassed the fourth quarter of 2019 with IMF in the U.S. and Canada, up nearly 30%. At the hotel level, we remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while containing operating costs. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter were again higher for the same period of \u201819 despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend scores in the U.S. improved for the tenth consecutive month and are now generally in line with 2019 scores. Hiring challenges have moderated and the number of open positions in the U.S. is now below 2019 levels. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash during 2022, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $2.4 billion, double the amount in 2021. Our loyalty program, with a modest source of cash before factoring in the reduced payments, received from the credit card companies. In 2023, we expect the loyalty to again be modestly cash positive before the impact of the final year of reduced payments. Now, let\u2019s talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our press release. Note that all RevPAR comparisons will be to 2022. More than 1 in 4 hotels that are currently comparable in both \u201822 and \u201823 or opened for the full year were not open in 2019, making comparisons to that year not really meaningful. I will start with the first quarter, which we anticipate will benefit from continued strong underlying trends. There is also a meaningfully easier comparison to the year ago quarter when the Omicron variant depressed lodging demand. Halfway through the quarter, bookings across customer segments and geographies are excellent. Momentum is being driven by rising cross-border travel and strong group revenues due to demand and ADR gains. Additionally, business transient revenues are benefiting from higher volumes and our successful special corporate rate negotiations. January global RevPAR rose 52%, with the U.S. and Canada up 43%. We anticipate that first quarter RevPAR could increase 25% to 27% in the U.S. and Canada, 47% to 49% in international markets and 30% to 32% worldwide. Given short-term booking windows and a significant level of macroeconomic uncertainty, there is less visibility in forecasting the company\u2019s financial performance for full year 2023. As a result, we are providing a broad range for full year RevPAR and other key metrics. The high end of the range reflects a relatively steady global economic picture throughout 2023. With continued resilience of travel demand across customer segments and markets, the low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy, beginning in the second quarter with worldwide RevPAR roughly flat compared to 22% in the second half of the year. So for the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could increase 5% to 9% and international RevPAR could rise 12% to 18%, leading to a global RevPAR gain of 6% to 11%. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2023 RevPAR versus 2022 could be around $40 million to $45 million of RevPAR-related fees. Total fees for the full year could rise between 6% and 12%, with the non-RevPAR-related component anticipated to rise 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 12% and adjusted EPS could rise 8% to 18% above 2022. After 3 years of meaningfully reduced investment spending, we anticipate 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million for the expected acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio and around $160 million of renovation spending on our own W Union Square Hotel in New York and the elegant hotel portfolio in Barbados. These hotels will be terrific representations of our W and all-inclusive brands when completed. We expect to recycle our capital investment in these hotels by selling them with long-term agreements. Spending in 2023 also incorporates higher than typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In 2022, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage was at the low end of investment grade targets. For 2023, capital returns to shareholders could be between $2.7 billion and $3.6 billion. Before we open the line, I too would like to express my gratitude to our incredible team of global associates around the world for their resilience and dedication. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nStephen Grambling: I wanted to start off on capital allocation actually. I guess given the moving parts within the rate environment, how are you thinking about the right leverage ratio? And how rate may actually dictate the outcome in terms of that capital allocation that you were referencing or returning cash to shareholders?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So overall, Stephen, as I stated in my comments, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we ended the year in terrific shape. I think you can tell from the range that we gave on RevPAR that we see ourselves being in really good shape this year from a cash flow perspective and earnings perspective that does give us great flexibility in how we think about our investing and our capital return. But from an interest rate environment, I think it\u2019s more about the overall macroeconomic activity and global growth picture than it is about a specific interest rate. Obviously, we need to see how it plays out. But being at the very low end of our credit ratio metrics, I think, gives us plenty of flexibility to deal with whatever may come.\nStephen Grambling: Great. And then maybe a little bit of a different follow-up. We've been seeing some volatility in the corporate booking data on our end. And I guess I'm wondering if you could discuss what you're seeing across large corporate demand versus small and medium-sized business, perhaps tie this into how it might influence the strong IMF that we\u2019ve been seeing?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the recovery for business transient broadly is still at about 90%. Interestingly for small and medium-sized companies, which represent about 60% ish of our total business transient, they were actually up 6% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. So that continues to be strong. We\u2019ve seen slower albeit steady recovery from larger companies, but they have got a bit of a ways to go to get back to pre-pandemic levels.\nLeeny Oberg: Stephen, the other thing I\u2019ll add is I hesitate to call that a trend yet, but it\u2019s just worth mentioning that in January, we saw our top special corporate accounts improve another 9 points relative to \u201819. So in the classic areas of accounting and consulting or defense or healthcare, we are continuing to see good progress there. but we are only a month into \u201823 so far.\nTony Capuano: And maybe the last point I would make, Stephen, is just reiterating what I said earlier in the call, and that is, for the last couple of years, we\u2019ve rolled over our special corporate rates. And so as we went into the negotiating season this year, we felt like we were in a pretty good place. And that really materialized as we saw negotiated special corporate rates in the high single digits.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nShaun Kelley: Tony, when you \u2013 good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about sort of the demand side. So obviously, we know the visibility is a little short in the industry from time to time. But obviously, it looks like everything you\u2019re seeing coincidentally is pretty strong. So could you help us just unpack a little bit? Your January trends look well above STR averages, even in North America. And then \u2013 so what\u2019s kind of powering that? And then specifically, as we kind of work our way through the year, could you just talk about \u2013 a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on maybe the lead generation side group and how you\u2019re underwriting China, just to help us kind of bridge the full year outlook?\nTony Capuano: Yes. Of course, Shaun, maybe I\u2019ll start with the group just because that\u2019s such a terrific story. You heard the numbers about where we were in the quarter with group revenue for group in the U.S. and Canada, about 10% ahead of where we were pre-pandemic. When we look into 2023, there is two things I would point to that are really compelling. Number one, we\u2019re currently pacing up about 20% year-over-year. And interestingly, that\u2019s not just a quarter one phenomenon, given the favorable comparisons. We\u2019re seeing pretty steady pacing across all quarters in 2023. Secondly, I would remind you that the shorter booking window is not specific to transient. We\u2019re seeing a little more compressed booking window in group as well. And so we think there is still meaningful upside to group as we launch in the year for the year bookings materialize during the balance of 2023.\nLeeny Oberg: And I\u2019ll jump in on China, Shaun, and that is \u2013 well, two things. One, to your point about January being particularly strong, if you remember, Omicron was particularly pronounced, right, as we got into January. And obviously, there is a significantly water degree of comfort this year as we moved into Q1. So I think you saw the momentum that was building in Q4 and really all throughout \u201822 continue into January as we saw all parts of the business firing on all cylinders. And then when you think about China, we saw tremendous leisure demand associated with the Chinese New Year, but we are really pleased with the overall pace of demand that we\u2019re seeing there. And just to give you a rough sense, we could see \u2013 in Greater China, we could see that RevPAR for the year \u201823 over \u201822 is over 30% increase. And obviously, the biggest increase will be in the first quarter.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Shaun.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nJoe Greff: Tony, can you talk about what\u2019s going on with pipeline signings in China presently? And how much of a, I guess, of a disruption, whether it be in the first quarter given what\u2019s been going on there? And then when you look back at the fourth quarter, and the development pipeline was down a little bit sequentially. There have been quarters in the last 4 years, where it\u2019s down sequentially. It doesn\u2019t mean anything necessarily. How much of the sequential pipeline in the fourth quarter was explained by disruption in China signings?\nTony Capuano: Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take the second question first. The pipeline tends, as you well know, to ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter. The statistic I look at related to pipeline that I think is a bit more telling is the 2% year-over-year increase in the pipeline. Obviously, deals come in and out of the pipeline in a year where nearly 30% of our openings were conversions. We\u2019ve talked in the past about the fact that some conversions never even make it into the pipeline. They get signed and opened quite quickly. On your first question about China signings, China signings last year were down about 15% from where we were in \u201821. And they were down a little more than third from where we were in \u201819. As the borders open, we expect to see meaningful positive impact certainly on demand patterns, but also on the health and the outlook of our development partners. And so we would expect an acceleration in deal volume.\nLeeny Oberg: And Joe, the only thing that I\u2019ll add is there was the obvious challenges for opening hotels in China tied to the shutdown in China that impacted permits and getting the teams trained and up and running. And so from that respect, we certainly saw a few drift from where we had expected them opened in Q4 to open in Q1. And I think that was clearly to be expected as they saw the shutdown continue. But again, as things open up, we look forward to them increasing.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thanks. Joe.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. My question is on the unit growth outlook, and there is some acceleration embedded in there. You mentioned China, obviously, is one of the drivers of that. And I guess the City Express acquisition. So just wondering if you have any other acquisitions in that unit growth guidance, just to clarify that?\nTony Capuano: We do not.\nRobin Farley: And then \u2013 okay. Great. Perfect. Thank you. And then my other question was on City Express because you\u2019ve talked about using that to grow in other regions. And I\u2019m curious you haven\u2019t mentioned potentially using it in the U.S. There are others out there sort of looking to grow units in the more limited service segments in the mid-scale and economy segments, and that hasn\u2019t been a big focus for Marriott. I\u2019m just curious if you have any thoughts on those segments, and then also sort of why or why not use of this new brand that is more \u2013 is further down the chain scale and some of your other brands in the U.S. market as well? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Of course. So we are very excited to get over the finish line with City Express. As we outlined, when we announced our intent to acquire Citi, it represents our entry into the mid-scale segment, which is very exciting. It increases our portfolio significantly in the important and growing CALA region. We expect to grow that brand aggressively across CALA, and we are \u2013 as we move towards closing that transaction, evaluating the applicability of that brand in other markets around the world. We\u2019ve not made definitive decisions about when and if we will roll out City Express in other places, but you can rest assured those evaluations and discussions are going on as we speak. I do think if you look at our historical track record of acquisitions, many of those acquisitions initially either strengthened our leadership position or gave us a meaningful foothold in a region where we weren\u2019t growing as quickly as we\u2019d like organically. And then over the passage of time, we look for opportunities to grow that platform more broadly. And I think the same strategy will apply to City Express.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up, if I could. Just \u2013 is there anything you would call out with termination fees? Is it a big part of the growth in that line item? How is that compared to termination fees for pre-pandemic? Or just anything going on there that you would call out? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. Nothing in particular. They do vary. They can be something related to one hotel or a particular transaction, but they vary. We\u2019ve talked about them before, Robin. It\u2019s kind of varying anywhere from $20 million to $40 million in a particular year. And as you saw from our deletions number, apart from Russia, we\u2019re really absolutely quite where we typically are. So there is nothing particular in that number.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nRichard Clarke: The first one is on the incentive fees. The incentive management fees seem to have recovered about 10% quicker than the base management fees. And in the past, you\u2019ve talked about whether that\u2019s a small number of hotels paying a lot of incentive fees or whether that\u2019s becoming a sort of more broad-based increase in profitability. So just wondering maybe you could comment on what\u2019s sort of supporting the outperformance of the incentive fee?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure, absolutely. So just \u2013 while Q4 was spectacular, and we really had a wonderful performance in our incentive fees. The reality is they are still meaningfully lower than they were in 2019, while the rest of our fees have grown quite nicely, our basin franchise fees as rooms have grown, RevPAR has recovered as well as the non-RevPAR fee growth has increased. So when you look at IMF as a percentage of total fees compared to \u201819, they have actually gone down. And we would expect them to continue to be a little bit lower than they have historically been. And they do, obviously, reflect a little bit riskier fee stream for us than comparing to the classic base in franchise fees. But when you look at kind of where we are in terms of hotel\u2019s earning incentive fees, I think there are a couple of interesting statistics. And that is that in \u201822, 61% of our managed hotels earned an incentive fee that compares to 72% in 2019. And in the U.S., 39% of our full-service hotels earned an incentive fee versus 45% in 2019. And I break \u2013 I don\u2019t include MSB because there is a very big difference in the managed limited service hotel portfolio between \u201822 and \u201819, so it\u2019s not as relevant a number. And as you know, many of our Asia Pacific incentive fees are not back to \u201819 levels as a result of their RevPAR recovering a bit later than the U.S. So I think we\u2019re thrilled with the performance of our operating team, very proud of the work that they have done, especially given wage increases. And I think to one point that you\u2019re raising; we\u2019re excited about what we see in \u201823 and the years ahead for the IMF potential for our hotels.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. That\u2019s great. Just a quick follow-up to someone\u2019s question earlier, they refer to acceleration in the net unit growth. If I did the math right, it looks like you did 3.6% ex-Russia exit in 2022, and that drops down to 3.5% ex-City Express in 2023. So is that correct? And if you\u2019ve got some China hotels moving into this year, where is that slowdown coming from?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, again, I want to make sure we certainly include City Express. When we think about our rooms growth, that\u2019s a very important component of how we think strategically about how we\u2019re growing around the world. So when I think about accelerating rooms growth that is a part of it. And then when I think of the timing, we\u2019ve clearly got the reality that construction starts over the past couple of years in the U.S. are having an impact in \u201823, in particular, in the U.S. for room openings. But again, otherwise, with the signings that you heard Tony talking about, we\u2019re very enthused about what we see going forward and then conversions have been a big component as well.\nRichard Clarke: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the capital spending in 2023. I know you broke out a couple of the line items. Are you thinking any differently about the way that you allocate, I guess, key money, either for conversions or for developers who are considering their brand options? Or anything different there than maybe you\u2019ve done in the past?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. No, Smedes, I thought you might ask this question. So I definitely think it would be helpful to break it down. So if you use, kind of roughly speaking, a midpoint of what I talked about, about $900 million and you take out the renovation projects at the W Union Square and Barbados as well as the $100 million for City Express, you\u2019re down to $650 million. Then you\u2019ve got higher spend on tech systems that will overwhelmingly be reimbursed to us from the system of, call it, another $150 million in \u201823 that\u2019s higher than typical. That then gets you down to $500 million, which is quite similar to this year\u2019s $500 million. I think when you think about key money being, again, in the ballpark of perhaps $200 million, $225 million in \u201823, that actually lines up quite well with our historical kinds of numbers for the growth of the system. And as you know, many, many of the deals that we signed do not require any capital investment on the part of Marriott.\nTony Capuano: And I might just build on that, Smedes, by reminding you of an obvious fact, which is \u2013 and we\u2019ve shared this in prior Analyst Days. The deals that we determine we may deploy some measure of Marriott capital, even in the form of key money, tend to drive premium valuations and premium fees. And they tend to be much more heavily weighted to our leading luxury portfolio and some of the upper upscale projects as well.\nSmedes Rose: Thanks. And can I just follow-up on Robin\u2019s question about City Express or just in general? With your largest, I guess U.S. competitor making a move on what\u2019s being termed, premium economy, do you feel that it\u2019s important for Marriott to also be in that segment in terms of sort of capturing, I guess, a wider range of customers? I mean traditionally, you haven\u2019t really dipped down below, I guess we call it like upper-mid scale. I mean I guess sort of thinking strategically, is that something that you need to be more attentive to or maybe not so much?\nTony Capuano: Yes, I won\u2019t comment on our competitors. What I will tell you is our growth strategy broadly is driven by what we hear from the two constituents that are most directly impacted, obviously, our guests and our owners and franchisees. And what we hear from them loudly and clearly is at the right quality level, entry into mid-scale is of great appeal. An alternative lodging product like Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy is equally appealing to both of those constituents, and that\u2019s where our focus lies right now in terms of expanding the portfolio.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTony Capuano: Sure.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Good morning. First question, I apologize if I missed this. But on your international RevPAR guidance for the first quarter and full year, can you just give us a little more quantification of how you would expect the various international markets to perform regarding \u2013 or versus those RevPAR ranges you gave, such as Europe and Asia Pacific? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So, broadly, you heard us talk about 47% to 49% for international in the first quarter. And as you think about kind of around the world, I would expect Asia Pacific, both APAC, in particular, outside of China to be meaningfully above that, Greater China, probably somewhere in that ballpark. You clearly saw that EMEA will also be kind of in that very high sort of range. With particularly Europe being a real outlier, very high given where they were a year ago in the first quarter. So, I think the easiest way to think about it is where Omicron was having the greatest impact is where you will see these outsized performances, because for example, a year ago, EMEA, the Middle East was not as impacted by Omicron. So, their year-over-year increase will not be as strong. I think one of the messages that we want you to hear is that in this current environment, when you think about kind of moving from Q4 into Q1, we are still seeing good opportunities for continued strength and growth in occupancy and rate apart from any normal seasonal variation.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up question, more of an operational issue. There is a bit of a debate out there whether housekeeping will be coming back. I was at Allison, I talked to some of the large managers, and they are at the belief that housekeeping will be coming back eventually on a daily type of service, I am curious what your thoughts are on that amenity? Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Of course, I might repeat myself a little bit in the comment I made earlier about City Express. When we make these sort of operating protocol decisions, we are guided by both the evolving expectations of our guests and the economic realities of our owners and franchisees weighing both of those sets of expectations and needs. What we have said is we will have modified housekeeping protocols by quality tier. So, in our luxury portfolio, we are essentially back to pre-pandemic full daily housekeeping. In the upper upscale tier, we have daily tidy, so not a full cleaning, but making the bed, changing the tearing [ph], cleaning the trash, etcetera. And in our select service, or MSB portfolio, we have every other day tidy. What we hear from our guests, if you give us optionality, which we do both in the booking path and a check-in. And if you give us something we can count on consistently, you will meet our needs. And this blended approach captures a lot of the economics that we created during the pandemic for our owners and franchisees.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nTony Capuano: Sure.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo.\nDori Kesten: Thanks. Good morning Tony and Leeny.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nDori Kesten: You mentioned higher technology costs this year. We have heard that you have some pretty interesting plans on that front that owners are looking forward to. Can you just walk through what the changes are that we may see over the next several years?\nLeeny Oberg: I will start and give you the investment perspective, and then I am sure Tony will jump in. So, I guess first, I would say this is not what I would call one thing. This is really a recognition that we view that the digital experience and the experience for our customers and for our associates on the systems that they interact with the company as being of critical importance over the next few years or really forever. And so in that regard, we are very excited about the work that we are doing on our tech systems that really will transform the experience for the mobile app and for our guests as they plan and execute their stays with us. It will also transform the experience for our associates, which is critically important as well as we think about how they take care of our guests, most particularly, as they are able to interact with our Bonvoy guests to really address their specific needs. So, as we look at rolling it out, you have probably seen our announcements of working with several third-party service providers to really transform several of our systems. But I also think it\u2019s worth noting that we have already done incredible things on our app and the experience from the digital communications and platform with our customers and our ability to really address their specific wants and needs has already improved meaningfully, and we expect to build on that.\nDori Kesten: Prefect. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to just look into the owned and leased profit within the guidance versus what you just reported. It looks like it is flattish or down a bit. And I just wondered was there something in \u201822 that lifted it up, or are there some \u2013 if you could help us unpack that a little bit.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. Absolutely. So, a couple of things. David, I would say, first of all, we do have two really important innovation \u2013 renovation projects going on in \u201823. No surprise, Barbados was crushing it over the past year as you think about leisure demand. And as we really do a very full renovation of these properties, that will have an impact on un-leased profits. I would expect termination fees to be a bit lower as we look at \u201823 versus \u201822. We had a couple of other things that are close to offsetting. If you remember, in Q1, in particular, of \u201822, we had the German subsidies. So, they hit in Q1 of \u201822, and we, obviously, will not have them in Q1 of \u201823. We also had an agreement on a pack of leased U.S. hotels that involved a charge later in the year in \u201822. And obviously, we won\u2019t have that in \u201823. So, there will be a little bit between the quarters that moves thing around. Those two things largely offset each other. So, I really would look to both termination fees as well as the issue around renovation.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And as my follow-up, I wanted to just touch on deletions quickly, because I \u2013 and I apologize if it sounds like a negative question. There has just been a lot of discussion about the NUG. But this 1 to 1.5 deletions going forward, is that what we should think about as kind of a normal course number?\nTony Capuano: It\u2019s a good question. I would suggest to you that the 1 to 1.5 range is more reflective of some of the uncertainty that Leeny described in her remarks, and it resulted ultimately in us providing forward guidance on RevPAR in a wider range than we might historically have offered.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nTony Capuano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Hey. Good morning. I might as well follow-up on the NUG question. Assuming no large acquisition repeats in 2023, should we assume that 2024 is back in that kind of 3.5% range?\nTony Capuano: Well, Bill, we were excited to be able to give you some visibility into \u201823. \u201824 is probably a little ambitious. What I will tell you though is, notwithstanding some of the constriction in the debt markets, we are encouraged that we are seeing incremental acceleration of construction starts, albeit not back to where we were in 2019. We are encouraged by what we experienced both on the signings and openings front in 2022 with conversions and expect that momentum to continue to build both on an individual asset basis and a portfolio basis.\nBill Crow: Okay. And then my follow-up question would be on just the operating expense environment in the U.S. If you could just kind of give us a little bit of details on what you are seeing on the labor front, kind of year-over-year increase and then maybe all other expenses or the total expense growth expectation for this year? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. As you have seen in our numbers, we have given you the expectation of 3% to 5% on the year. And that really, as you think about it, reflects just continuing to be more and more back-end business. So, whether it is higher travel expenses or a little bit more annualization of positions that we added in \u201821 and \u201822. But really, other than that, I would say, really quite normal. The wage pressures have moderated, Bill. And we are seeing a more normalized environment, both at the property level as well as above property.\nBill Crow: Great. Thanks Leeny.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: Hey. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you so much. So, maybe starting with you, Lenny, if you could. You mentioned non-RevPAR fees growing \u2013 could grow 4% to 7%. I was wondering if you would be willing to break that out a little bit and talk about the credit card fee portion, at least in relation to RevPAR growth? And then what that would imply for residential fees and other?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So, as you know, residential branding fees are bumpy. They really do vary depending on the timing of the opening of when a building is complete and people can actually move in and close their sales. So, they tend to vary. They have gone anywhere from $40 million to $70 million within the space of 2 years. As you have heard us say, we have a really robust pipeline of residential projects. And so while I would expect the residential branding fees to be more flattish compared to \u201822, that\u2019s really just a reflection of timing. When I think about credit card fees, we expect them to increase both as a combination of a higher number of cardholders, and that\u2019s partly in the U.S. and partly from the fact that we have added a bunch of other countries as well as increased spend. I do think the average spend for an existing cardholder, that growth will moderate in \u201823 as compared to \u201822. Those are tied into how, I think generally we are seeing the economic view. So, for example, that might look more like inflation, while the wonderful terrific increase comes from more and more cardholders.\nBrandt Montour: That\u2019s hugely helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up on the development outlook and discussion from earlier. Obviously, signings sound like they are really strong, Tony had talked about. I am curious if you could talk a little bit about the segment of the pipeline that\u2019s in the planning phases, not just signed, but maybe had been there for a little bit? And not necessarily stale, but just curious if there is a dynamic in that pipeline that you are seeing that\u2019s any different than history?\nTony Capuano: No, I don\u2019t think so. I mean maybe the best empirical metric to answer your question is fall-out from the pipeline, which would be canceled projects, and that\u2019s running interestingly kind of on pace with what we have experienced historically over a long period of time and with what we were experiencing prior to the pandemic. As Leeny pointed out in response to an earlier question, the move from sign to getting a shovel on the ground has not accelerated as much as we would like. But again, we are seeing the number of construction starts, particularly in the U.S., moving meaningfully from the bottom of the trough, albeit not quite back to where we were prior to pandemic.\nBrandt Montour: Prefect. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask about group pace. Tony, you talked about kind of the movement to \u2013 in the year, for the year. And kind of how that\u2019s changed over the past couple of years? So, as we look out to like \u201824, what percentage of rooms are on the books now versus what would normally be on the books this early? And does that kind of affect how you think about RevPAR outlooks? Thanks \nTony Capuano: Sure. So, as I mentioned earlier, the group has been a real bright spot for us and not just looking backwards, but even forward. If you look at what we have on the books for \u201824 on January 1, \u201823, that\u2019s about 5% ahead in gross revenue from where we were a year prior, meaning comparing that to what was on the books for \u201823 on January 1, 2022. And so we are pacing ahead of where we were a year ago. And we are enthused at the prospect of those numbers continuing to expand because of the in the year, for the year phenomenon that you described.\nChad Beynon: Okay. Great. And then something that we will probably talk a lot more about as we get through \u201823, Congress has talked about a reduction in what they call surprise fees. So, I guess these would \u2013 in your industry, they could potentially hit some of the resorts on the back-end. Can you talk about how your partners are thinking about what would happen if these below-the-line fees kind of move to above-the-line? If those would just be included in the rate or if there could be a difficult transition period if they are banned? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Well, as you would expect, we listened with great interest to the President\u2019s comments during the State of the Union. It appeared, if you listen to what he actually said, his concern was \u201chidden fees.\u201d And the manner in which we disclose resort fees or destination fees, combined with the rigorous process we have to approve the implementation of one of those fees and the requirements for a meaningful value proposition before those fees are approved, give us comfort that we have the right strategy. The other thing I would remind you across our 8,300 hotel portfolio, I think we have got less than 300 hotels that have those sorts of fees. So, in terms of materiality, it\u2019s quite impactful for those individual owners, but less impactful on a portfolio-wide basis.\nChad Beynon: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Capuano: Well, I want to thank you again. These calls are a lot more fun to engage with you as we continue to see empirical evidence of the resilience of travel. We appreciate your thoughtful questions and look forward to seeing you on the road. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for Marriott. After achieving global RevPAR recovery in June, we finished the year on a real high note, with RevPAR versus 2019, up 7% in December and up 5% in the fourth quarter. Each quarter saw sequential improvement in global occupancy and ADR compared to 2019. We ended the year with fourth quarter occupancy down just 5 percentage points and ADR up 13%. With Asia-Pacific, excluding China, or APAC surpassing pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, all regions, except Greater China, have now more than fully recovered. It is abundantly clear that people love to travel. Globally, leisure demand has remained robust. In the fourth quarter, leisure transient room nights increased 7% versus 2019. And we continued driving leisure ADR, which rose 22%. Our group business experienced the most meaningful improvement in 2022. In the U.S. and Canada, fourth quarter group revenues increased 10% above the same quarter in 2019. Group revenue for 2023 is already pacing up 20% year-over-year, with room night and rate gains each quarter. Given strong lead generation and increased rate quotes, especially for in-the-year, for-the-year bookings, we expect group revenues this year to strengthen further. In 2022, around half of group room nights were booked in the year compared to just one-third in 2019. U.S. and Canada business transient demand remained steady from the third to the fourth quarter at around 90% recovery. For 2023, we are pleased to have negotiated special corporate rate growth in the high single-digits after holding these rates steady the last 2 years. Our day-of-the-week trends in the U.S. and Canada continue to point to the blending of business and leisure trips. In the fourth quarter, midweek occupancy was still down mid single-digit percentage points versus 2019, while occupancy on shoulder and weekend nights was down the low single-digits. Additionally, the average length of a business transient trip in the U.S. has risen by more than 20% versus 2019. Rising cross-border travel also helped spur overall demand growth during the quarter, though we believe there is still further upside in 2023, especially now that China's borders have reopened. Guests traveling outside their home country accounted for 16% of transient room nights globally in the 2022 fourth quarter, 1 percentage point higher than the prior quarter, yet still 3 percentage points lower than 2019. With more than 177 million members, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program has also been a key driver of demand for our hotels and other lodging offerings and for adjacent products like our Bonvoy co-branded credit cards. Our growing portfolio of credit cards, now in 9 countries following our November card launch in Saudi Arabia, had record global card member acquisitions and card spend last year. Product innovation and engagement with our members remain key focus areas, especially through investments in our Marriott Bonvoy app and other digital products. We have made great gains in contributions from our digital platforms, which are highly profitable channels for our owners and anticipate many additional enhancements over the next couple of years. In 2022, our mobile app users were up 32% year-over-year, digital room nights rose 27%, and digital revenues climbed 41%. The financing environment for new projects and hotel sales remains challenging, especially here in the U.S. given higher interest rates and uncertainties surrounding a potential economic downturn. However, other industry headwinds like supply chain disruptions, construction costs and availability of labor have improved. Given strong local operating trends, overall developer sentiment improved in 2022 and we had another year of strong signing activity. Our global development team signed franchise and management agreements for nearly 108,000 rooms last year. In addition, upon the anticipated closing of the transaction, the City Express portfolio should add around 17,000 rooms in the moderately priced mid-scale space. We are excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region as well as in other locations around the world. We also recently announced Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy, a new 1 to 3-bedroom serviced apartment brand that we plan to launch in the upper-upscale and luxury segments. We have already received a great deal of initial interests from owners and developers. Momentum in conversions continues, including in multi-property opportunities, thanks to the breadth of our roster of convergent-friendly brands across the chain scales. The meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our portfolio make these brands very attractive to owners. Conversions represented nearly 20% of room signings and 27% of room additions in 2022. We added a total of 394 properties last year, representing more than 65,000 rooms and grew our industry leading system 4.4% on a gross basis or 3.1% net year-over-year. Excluding the impact from our exit of Russia, our net rooms growth was 3.6%. For 2023, we are forecasting gross rooms growth of around 5.5%, including around 1 percentage point from the anticipated addition of the City Express rooms to our franchise system. Assuming deletions of 1% to 1.5%, net rooms could grow 4% to 4.5%. I'd like to pivot now and share a few highlights of our recent ESG efforts. ESG is an integral part of our company's culture and strategy, and our company is dedicated to making a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. In June, we committed $50 million to support historically underrepresented groups in the journey to hotel ownership through our new program here in North America called Marriott's Bridging The Gap. This program should help us reach our goal of having at least 3,000 diverse and women-owned hotels in our system by 2025. In December, we announced that over 1 million Marriott associates have taken our human trafficking training, which we have also donated to the wider hospitality industries. In terms of workforce diversity and inclusion, our aim is to achieve global gender parity in the company's leadership by 2023 and have people of color hold 25% of U.S. executive positions by 2025. We also continue our work to set science-based emissions reduction targets, with more details expected to come later this year. I am proud of these accomplishments and all that we have achieved in 2022. As we look ahead to full year 2023, there is meaningful uncertainty about global economic growth. Lodging is a cyclical business and it's not immune to downturns in the macroeconomic environment. To-date, however, we have not seen signs of demand softening. Certainly, trends could change relatively quickly given our average transient booking window is around 3 weeks. But 1.5 months into 2023, booking demand and pricing remains strong. As Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we are optimistic that global RevPAR will grow year-over-year even if the global economy softens in the back half of this year. Before I turn the call over to Leeny, I'd like to thank our associates around the world for their hard work and commitment in navigating the last few challenging years and in helping the company achieve these record financial results. I also want to make a couple of statements regarding two of my senior team members. I am sure you saw the news in December that Stephanie Linnartz has been appointed Under Armour's new President and CEO, a role that she will assume at the end of this month. Also, after a 35-year career with Marriott that has spanned the globe, Craig Smith, our Group President, International, has informed me of his decision to retire from the company later this month. Craig has developed and mentored hundreds of hotel general managers and above property leaders around the world and has helped us meaningfully accelerate the growth of our international business. I want to thank both Stephanie and Craig for their decades of dedication and countless contributions to Marriott. While I will personally miss these two excellent senior executives, I am proud that we have such an incredibly deep management bench. I look forward to sharing more details about new leadership appointments soon. Now, let me turn the call over to Leeny. Leeny? Good morning. Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the recovery for business transient broadly is still at about 90%. Interestingly for small and medium-sized companies, which represent about 60% ish of our total business transient, they were actually up 6% quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. So that continues to be strong. We've seen slower albeit steady recovery from larger companies, but they have got a bit of a ways to go to get back to pre-pandemic levels. And maybe the last point I would make, Stephen, is just reiterating what I said earlier in the call, and that is, for the last couple of years, we've rolled over our special corporate rates. And so as we went into the negotiating season this year, we felt like we were in a pretty good place. And that really materialized as we saw negotiated special corporate rates in the high single digits. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Of course, Shaun, maybe I'll start with the group just because that's such a terrific story. You heard the numbers about where we were in the quarter with group revenue for group in the U.S. and Canada, about 10% ahead of where we were pre-pandemic. When we look into 2023, there is two things I would point to that are really compelling. Number one, we're currently pacing up about 20% year-over-year. And interestingly, that's not just a quarter one phenomenon, given the favorable comparisons. We're seeing pretty steady pacing across all quarters in 2023. Secondly, I would remind you that the shorter booking window is not specific to transient. We're seeing a little more compressed booking window in group as well. And so we think there is still meaningful upside to group as we launch in the year for the year bookings materialize during the balance of 2023. Thanks, Shaun. Good morning. Sure. Maybe I'll take the second question first. The pipeline tends, as you well know, to ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter. The statistic I look at related to pipeline that I think is a bit more telling is the 2% year-over-year increase in the pipeline. Obviously, deals come in and out of the pipeline in a year where nearly 30% of our openings were conversions. We've talked in the past about the fact that some conversions never even make it into the pipeline. They get signed and opened quite quickly. On your first question about China signings, China signings last year were down about 15% from where we were in \u201821. And they were down a little more than third from where we were in \u201819. As the borders open, we expect to see meaningful positive impact certainly on demand patterns, but also on the health and the outlook of our development partners. And so we would expect an acceleration in deal volume. Thanks. Joe. We do not. Of course. So we are very excited to get over the finish line with City Express. As we outlined, when we announced our intent to acquire Citi, it represents our entry into the mid-scale segment, which is very exciting. It increases our portfolio significantly in the important and growing CALA region. We expect to grow that brand aggressively across CALA, and we are \u2013 as we move towards closing that transaction, evaluating the applicability of that brand in other markets around the world. We've not made definitive decisions about when and if we will roll out City Express in other places, but you can rest assured those evaluations and discussions are going on as we speak. I do think if you look at our historical track record of acquisitions, many of those acquisitions initially either strengthened our leadership position or gave us a meaningful foothold in a region where we weren't growing as quickly as we'd like organically. And then over the passage of time, we look for opportunities to grow that platform more broadly. And I think the same strategy will apply to City Express. Thanks. Good morning. And I might just build on that, Smedes, by reminding you of an obvious fact, which is \u2013 and we've shared this in prior Analyst Days. The deals that we determine we may deploy some measure of Marriott capital, even in the form of key money, tend to drive premium valuations and premium fees. And they tend to be much more heavily weighted to our leading luxury portfolio and some of the upper upscale projects as well. Yes, I won't comment on our competitors. What I will tell you is our growth strategy broadly is driven by what we hear from the two constituents that are most directly impacted, obviously, our guests and our owners and franchisees. And what we hear from them loudly and clearly is at the right quality level, entry into mid-scale is of great appeal. An alternative lodging product like Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy is equally appealing to both of those constituents, and that's where our focus lies right now in terms of expanding the portfolio. Sure. Good morning. Of course, I might repeat myself a little bit in the comment I made earlier about City Express. When we make these sort of operating protocol decisions, we are guided by both the evolving expectations of our guests and the economic realities of our owners and franchisees weighing both of those sets of expectations and needs. What we have said is we will have modified housekeeping protocols by quality tier. So, in our luxury portfolio, we are essentially back to pre-pandemic full daily housekeeping. In the upper upscale tier, we have daily tidy, so not a full cleaning, but making the bed, changing the tearing [ph], cleaning the trash, etcetera. And in our select service, or MSB portfolio, we have every other day tidy. What we hear from our guests, if you give us optionality, which we do both in the booking path and a check-in. And if you give us something we can count on consistently, you will meet our needs. And this blended approach captures a lot of the economics that we created during the pandemic for our owners and franchisees. Sure. It's a good question. I would suggest to you that the 1 to 1.5 range is more reflective of some of the uncertainty that Leeny described in her remarks, and it resulted ultimately in us providing forward guidance on RevPAR in a wider range than we might historically have offered. You're welcome. Well, Bill, we were excited to be able to give you some visibility into \u201823. \u201824 is probably a little ambitious. What I will tell you though is, notwithstanding some of the constriction in the debt markets, we are encouraged that we are seeing incremental acceleration of construction starts, albeit not back to where we were in 2019. We are encouraged by what we experienced both on the signings and openings front in 2022 with conversions and expect that momentum to continue to build both on an individual asset basis and a portfolio basis. No, I don't think so. I mean maybe the best empirical metric to answer your question is fall-out from the pipeline, which would be canceled projects, and that's running interestingly kind of on pace with what we have experienced historically over a long period of time and with what we were experiencing prior to the pandemic. As Leeny pointed out in response to an earlier question, the move from sign to getting a shovel on the ground has not accelerated as much as we would like. But again, we are seeing the number of construction starts, particularly in the U.S., moving meaningfully from the bottom of the trough, albeit not quite back to where we were prior to pandemic. Sure. So, as I mentioned earlier, the group has been a real bright spot for us and not just looking backwards, but even forward. If you look at what we have on the books for \u201824 on January 1, \u201823, that's about 5% ahead in gross revenue from where we were a year prior, meaning comparing that to what was on the books for \u201823 on January 1, 2022. And so we are pacing ahead of where we were a year ago. And we are enthused at the prospect of those numbers continuing to expand because of the in the year, for the year phenomenon that you described. Well, as you would expect, we listened with great interest to the President's comments during the State of the Union. It appeared, if you listen to what he actually said, his concern was \u201chidden fees.\u201d And the manner in which we disclose resort fees or destination fees, combined with the rigorous process we have to approve the implementation of one of those fees and the requirements for a meaningful value proposition before those fees are approved, give us comfort that we have the right strategy. The other thing I would remind you across our 8,300 hotel portfolio, I think we have got less than 300 hotels that have those sorts of fees. So, in terms of materiality, it's quite impactful for those individual owners, but less impactful on a portfolio-wide basis. Well, I want to thank you again. These calls are a lot more fun to engage with you as we continue to see empirical evidence of the resilience of travel. We appreciate your thoughtful questions and look forward to seeing you on the road. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. With sustained momentum in global RevPAR growth, we reported an outstanding quarter. Gross fees rose 16% and adjusted EBITDA climbed 21% over the 2019 fourth quarter. For the full year, we posted record fees, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, despite the Omicron variant causing a slow start to the year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR versus 2019 accelerated nicely from the third quarter in every region, except Greater China. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, fourth quarter U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 5%, aided by 11% growth in ADR. RevPAR in the region versus 2019 improved sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter across all market types, from primary to tertiary and all brand tiers, from luxury to select service. International RevPAR rose 3% above pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, driven by improvements in the comparison to 2019 for both rate and occupancy. In the Middle East and Africa, or MEA, RevPAR grew 44%, boosted by the World Cup in Qatar. RevPAR increased 28% in CALA, 7% in Europe and 6% in Asia-Pacific, except for China. While results in Greater China were, again, impacted by lockdowns in the fourth quarter, the region reached a major milestone with the new open border policy and the lifting of quarantine requirements in January. It could take time to increase airline capacity and work-through passport and visa requests, but we are optimistic about meaningful RevPAR recovery in the region as these issues abate. We saw a huge demand surge in January during the Chinese New Year holiday, with RevPAR for the holiday period nearly in line with 2019. Other regions are also anticipated to benefit from an increase in outbound China travel, especially APAC, where over 40% of room nights in 2019 came from Chinese travelers. In the fourth quarter, total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees. Those fees rose 16% year-over-year to $215 million, driven largely by our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, rose impressively in the quarter, reaching $186 million. IMF surpassed the fourth quarter of 2019 with IMF in the U.S. and Canada, up nearly 30%. At the hotel level, we remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while containing operating costs. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter were again higher for the same period of \u201819 despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend scores in the U.S. improved for the tenth consecutive month and are now generally in line with 2019 scores. Hiring challenges have moderated and the number of open positions in the U.S. is now below 2019 levels. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash during 2022, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $2.4 billion, double the amount in 2021. Our loyalty program, with a modest source of cash before factoring in the reduced payments, received from the credit card companies. In 2023, we expect the loyalty to again be modestly cash positive before the impact of the final year of reduced payments. Now, let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our press release. Note that all RevPAR comparisons will be to 2022. More than 1 in 4 hotels that are currently comparable in both \u201822 and \u201823 or opened for the full year were not open in 2019, making comparisons to that year not really meaningful. I will start with the first quarter, which we anticipate will benefit from continued strong underlying trends. There is also a meaningfully easier comparison to the year ago quarter when the Omicron variant depressed lodging demand. Halfway through the quarter, bookings across customer segments and geographies are excellent. Momentum is being driven by rising cross-border travel and strong group revenues due to demand and ADR gains. Additionally, business transient revenues are benefiting from higher volumes and our successful special corporate rate negotiations. January global RevPAR rose 52%, with the U.S. and Canada up 43%. We anticipate that first quarter RevPAR could increase 25% to 27% in the U.S. and Canada, 47% to 49% in international markets and 30% to 32% worldwide. Given short-term booking windows and a significant level of macroeconomic uncertainty, there is less visibility in forecasting the company's financial performance for full year 2023. As a result, we are providing a broad range for full year RevPAR and other key metrics. The high end of the range reflects a relatively steady global economic picture throughout 2023. With continued resilience of travel demand across customer segments and markets, the low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy, beginning in the second quarter with worldwide RevPAR roughly flat compared to 22% in the second half of the year. So for the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could increase 5% to 9% and international RevPAR could rise 12% to 18%, leading to a global RevPAR gain of 6% to 11%. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2023 RevPAR versus 2022 could be around $40 million to $45 million of RevPAR-related fees. Total fees for the full year could rise between 6% and 12%, with the non-RevPAR-related component anticipated to rise 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 12% and adjusted EPS could rise 8% to 18% above 2022. After 3 years of meaningfully reduced investment spending, we anticipate 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million for the expected acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio and around $160 million of renovation spending on our own W Union Square Hotel in New York and the elegant hotel portfolio in Barbados. These hotels will be terrific representations of our W and all-inclusive brands when completed. We expect to recycle our capital investment in these hotels by selling them with long-term agreements. Spending in 2023 also incorporates higher than typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In 2022, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders. At the end of the fourth quarter, our leverage was at the low end of investment grade targets. For 2023, capital returns to shareholders could be between $2.7 billion and $3.6 billion. Before we open the line, I too would like to express my gratitude to our incredible team of global associates around the world for their resilience and dedication. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Good morning. Sure. So overall, Stephen, as I stated in my comments, we are committed to a strong investment-grade credit rating. And we ended the year in terrific shape. I think you can tell from the range that we gave on RevPAR that we see ourselves being in really good shape this year from a cash flow perspective and earnings perspective that does give us great flexibility in how we think about our investing and our capital return. But from an interest rate environment, I think it's more about the overall macroeconomic activity and global growth picture than it is about a specific interest rate. Obviously, we need to see how it plays out. But being at the very low end of our credit ratio metrics, I think, gives us plenty of flexibility to deal with whatever may come. Stephen, the other thing I'll add is I hesitate to call that a trend yet, but it's just worth mentioning that in January, we saw our top special corporate accounts improve another 9 points relative to \u201819. So in the classic areas of accounting and consulting or defense or healthcare, we are continuing to see good progress there. but we are only a month into \u201823 so far. Good morning. And I'll jump in on China, Shaun, and that is \u2013 well, two things. One, to your point about January being particularly strong, if you remember, Omicron was particularly pronounced, right, as we got into January. And obviously, there is a significantly water degree of comfort this year as we moved into Q1. So I think you saw the momentum that was building in Q4 and really all throughout \u201822 continue into January as we saw all parts of the business firing on all cylinders. And then when you think about China, we saw tremendous leisure demand associated with the Chinese New Year, but we are really pleased with the overall pace of demand that we're seeing there. And just to give you a rough sense, we could see \u2013 in Greater China, we could see that RevPAR for the year \u201823 over \u201822 is over 30% increase. And obviously, the biggest increase will be in the first quarter. And Joe, the only thing that I'll add is there was the obvious challenges for opening hotels in China tied to the shutdown in China that impacted permits and getting the teams trained and up and running. And so from that respect, we certainly saw a few drift from where we had expected them opened in Q4 to open in Q1. And I think that was clearly to be expected as they saw the shutdown continue. But again, as things open up, we look forward to them increasing. Sure. Nothing in particular. They do vary. They can be something related to one hotel or a particular transaction, but they vary. We've talked about them before, Robin. It's kind of varying anywhere from $20 million to $40 million in a particular year. And as you saw from our deletions number, apart from Russia, we're really absolutely quite where we typically are. So there is nothing particular in that number. Yes, sure, absolutely. So just \u2013 while Q4 was spectacular, and we really had a wonderful performance in our incentive fees. The reality is they are still meaningfully lower than they were in 2019, while the rest of our fees have grown quite nicely, our basin franchise fees as rooms have grown, RevPAR has recovered as well as the non-RevPAR fee growth has increased. So when you look at IMF as a percentage of total fees compared to \u201819, they have actually gone down. And we would expect them to continue to be a little bit lower than they have historically been. And they do, obviously, reflect a little bit riskier fee stream for us than comparing to the classic base in franchise fees. But when you look at kind of where we are in terms of hotel's earning incentive fees, I think there are a couple of interesting statistics. And that is that in \u201822, 61% of our managed hotels earned an incentive fee that compares to 72% in 2019. And in the U.S., 39% of our full-service hotels earned an incentive fee versus 45% in 2019. And I break \u2013 I don't include MSB because there is a very big difference in the managed limited service hotel portfolio between \u201822 and \u201819, so it's not as relevant a number. And as you know, many of our Asia Pacific incentive fees are not back to \u201819 levels as a result of their RevPAR recovering a bit later than the U.S. So I think we're thrilled with the performance of our operating team, very proud of the work that they have done, especially given wage increases. And I think to one point that you're raising; we're excited about what we see in \u201823 and the years ahead for the IMF potential for our hotels. Well, again, I want to make sure we certainly include City Express. When we think about our rooms growth, that's a very important component of how we think strategically about how we're growing around the world. So when I think about accelerating rooms growth that is a part of it. And then when I think of the timing, we've clearly got the reality that construction starts over the past couple of years in the U.S. are having an impact in \u201823, in particular, in the U.S. for room openings. But again, otherwise, with the signings that you heard Tony talking about, we're very enthused about what we see going forward and then conversions have been a big component as well. Yes. No, Smedes, I thought you might ask this question. So I definitely think it would be helpful to break it down. So if you use, kind of roughly speaking, a midpoint of what I talked about, about $900 million and you take out the renovation projects at the W Union Square and Barbados as well as the $100 million for City Express, you're down to $650 million. Then you've got higher spend on tech systems that will overwhelmingly be reimbursed to us from the system of, call it, another $150 million in \u201823 that's higher than typical. That then gets you down to $500 million, which is quite similar to this year's $500 million. I think when you think about key money being, again, in the ballpark of perhaps $200 million, $225 million in \u201823, that actually lines up quite well with our historical kinds of numbers for the growth of the system. And as you know, many, many of the deals that we signed do not require any capital investment on the part of Marriott. Yes. So, broadly, you heard us talk about 47% to 49% for international in the first quarter. And as you think about kind of around the world, I would expect Asia Pacific, both APAC, in particular, outside of China to be meaningfully above that, Greater China, probably somewhere in that ballpark. You clearly saw that EMEA will also be kind of in that very high sort of range. With particularly Europe being a real outlier, very high given where they were a year ago in the first quarter. So, I think the easiest way to think about it is where Omicron was having the greatest impact is where you will see these outsized performances, because for example, a year ago, EMEA, the Middle East was not as impacted by Omicron. So, their year-over-year increase will not be as strong. I think one of the messages that we want you to hear is that in this current environment, when you think about kind of moving from Q4 into Q1, we are still seeing good opportunities for continued strength and growth in occupancy and rate apart from any normal seasonal variation. Good morning. I will start and give you the investment perspective, and then I am sure Tony will jump in. So, I guess first, I would say this is not what I would call one thing. This is really a recognition that we view that the digital experience and the experience for our customers and for our associates on the systems that they interact with the company as being of critical importance over the next few years or really forever. And so in that regard, we are very excited about the work that we are doing on our tech systems that really will transform the experience for the mobile app and for our guests as they plan and execute their stays with us. It will also transform the experience for our associates, which is critically important as well as we think about how they take care of our guests, most particularly, as they are able to interact with our Bonvoy guests to really address their specific needs. So, as we look at rolling it out, you have probably seen our announcements of working with several third-party service providers to really transform several of our systems. But I also think it's worth noting that we have already done incredible things on our app and the experience from the digital communications and platform with our customers and our ability to really address their specific wants and needs has already improved meaningfully, and we expect to build on that. Sure. Absolutely. So, a couple of things. David, I would say, first of all, we do have two really important innovation \u2013 renovation projects going on in \u201823. No surprise, Barbados was crushing it over the past year as you think about leisure demand. And as we really do a very full renovation of these properties, that will have an impact on un-leased profits. I would expect termination fees to be a bit lower as we look at \u201823 versus \u201822. We had a couple of other things that are close to offsetting. If you remember, in Q1, in particular, of \u201822, we had the German subsidies. So, they hit in Q1 of \u201822, and we, obviously, will not have them in Q1 of \u201823. We also had an agreement on a pack of leased U.S. hotels that involved a charge later in the year in \u201822. And obviously, we won't have that in \u201823. So, there will be a little bit between the quarters that moves thing around. Those two things largely offset each other. So, I really would look to both termination fees as well as the issue around renovation. Sure. As you have seen in our numbers, we have given you the expectation of 3% to 5% on the year. And that really, as you think about it, reflects just continuing to be more and more back-end business. So, whether it is higher travel expenses or a little bit more annualization of positions that we added in \u201821 and \u201822. But really, other than that, I would say, really quite normal. The wage pressures have moderated, Bill. And we are seeing a more normalized environment, both at the property level as well as above property. Sure. So, as you know, residential branding fees are bumpy. They really do vary depending on the timing of the opening of when a building is complete and people can actually move in and close their sales. So, they tend to vary. They have gone anywhere from $40 million to $70 million within the space of 2 years. As you have heard us say, we have a really robust pipeline of residential projects. And so while I would expect the residential branding fees to be more flattish compared to \u201822, that's really just a reflection of timing. When I think about credit card fees, we expect them to increase both as a combination of a higher number of cardholders, and that's partly in the U.S. and partly from the fact that we have added a bunch of other countries as well as increased spend. I do think the average spend for an existing cardholder, that growth will moderate in \u201823 as compared to \u201822. Those are tied into how, I think generally we are seeing the economic view. So, for example, that might look more like inflation, while the wonderful terrific increase comes from more and more cardholders. Thank you."

It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Jackie Burka, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJackie McConagha: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and average daily rate comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporary closed due to COVID-19.  RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflect properties that are defined as comparable as of September 30, 2022, even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to prepandemic for 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony.\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had an outstanding third quarter. Quarter rose above 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began, up nearly 2%. RevPAR compared to 2019 improved sequentially from the second quarter in every region around the world. Global occupancy rose to 69% while ADR outpaced by 2019, excuse me, by a remarkable 10%. Compared to prepandemic levels, worldwide RevPAR in September reached a new monthly high watermark, increasing more than 4% or nearly 7%, excluding Greater China.  During the quarter, leisure demand remained strong, well above 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, Full-Service group revenue for the quarter showed continued growth, ending up 3% over the same quarter in 2019. Fourth quarter Full-Service group revenue is currently pacing up 4%, but is likely to improve further given the strong last-minute group bookings that we've seen all year. The trend towards last-minute bookings has led to meaningful compression in pricing power, helping group ADR for new bookings rise each quarter this year.  At our managed hotels in the U.S., ADR for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings made in the third quarter rose 17% compared to same year bookings made in the 2019, 3rd quarter. A significant jump from the 6% increase we saw in the first quarter. ADR for group bookings made in the third quarter for 2023 outpaced 2019, 3rd quarter bookings for events in 2000 by 24%. Business transient demand also continued to improve during the quarter, although it still lags 2019 levels. Third quarter business transient room nights in the U.S. and Canada were 11% below 2019. We are currently in the midst of our special corporate negotiations for 2023 and are very pleased with how they're progressing. After 2 years of holding rates steady, the early results look positive for at least high single-digit year-over-year rate growth. Third quarter day-of-the-week trends continue to suggest that travelers are combining leisure and business trips. In fact, the average length of a transient business trip has increased meaningfully, and year-to-date is up more than 15% compared to 2019. With borders reopened in most countries around the world, rising cross-border travel helped spur demand during the quarter, especially in Europe and in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region. Cross-border guests accounted for 15% of our global room nights in the third quarter, an uptick from 12% in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, 18% of travel to our properties was from cross-border guests. So we anticipate additional upside from international travel especially from Greater China once stringent travel restrictions are relaxed.  Given rapidly rising interest rates and growing concerns about a possible global recession, we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends. There is no doubt that the hospitality industry is impacted by economic cycles. And with transient booking windows averaging only about 3 weeks, trends could change relatively quickly. However, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. In fact, we've seen just the opposite. Booking trends remain very healthy. Given sustained high levels of employment, consumer trends prioritizing experiences versus goods, pent-up travel demand and a high level of consumer savings, travel spending has been incredibly resilient.  In October, demand remained strong across our regions, with the exception of Greater China, where trends are still low. Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program grew to 173 million members at the end of the third quarter. The program achieved record penetration levels in the quarter reaching 60% in the U.S. and Canada and 53% globally. Members also continued to engage with our co-brand credit cards, which had another solid quarter. After recently making significant enhancements by adding new benefits to many of our U.S. cards, sign-ups have well exceeded expectations.  This led to record new cardholder acquisitions as well as record spending for the first 9 months of this year. We also introduced 2 mid-tier cards at the end of September, which should help drive strong growth going forward. While much smaller fee contributors that are U.S. co-brand cards, we have similarly seen record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spend. This has been particularly driven by China, where we've had great traction after launching our first cards there in July. Our Bonvoy members have been increasingly interacting with the platform through our direct digital channels, which helps boost owner and franchisee profitability. Since 2019, our share of room nights booked through direct digital channels has increased more than 5 percentage points to 38% while our distribution through OTAs has risen by less than 1 percentage point to 12%.  The power of Bonvoy in our direct channels has also been evident in our latest offering, the Ritz-Carlton Yacht which made its inaugural voyage from Barcelona last month. Remarkably, around 2/3 of all bookings for this incredible brand extension have been through direct channels, which is many times above the rates most cruise companies experience. Additionally, Bonvoy members account for more than half of the Yacht bookings. We look forward to more ships joining the portfolio in the future.  Shifting to the development front, our pipeline grew for the fourth quarter in a row, totaling more than 502,000 rooms by the end of the third quarter. Signing activity in the quarter remained healthy in most regions of the world. Our development team continues to be laser focused on conversions, a particularly bright spot in the development story. Conversions represented 21% of room signings and 27% of room openings in the quarter. We are very enthusiastic about the level of conversations on conversions, including for multiunit conversion opportunities.  Outside the Greater China, we were pleased to see new construction starts pick up nicely in the third quarter. While not yet back to 2019 levels, new construction starts in the U.S. reached the highest quarterly level since the pandemic began. For full year 2022, we now expect gross rooms growth of approximately 4.5% compared to our prior expectation of closer to 5%. The change is primarily a result of fewer expected openings in Greater China as the lockdowns there have extended construction time lines. The good news is that we have not seen deals in Greater China or in any of our regions falling out of the pipeline at a higher than usual rate. With just 2 months left in the year, we now expect deletions at the bottom end of our prior guidance. Deletions could be about 1.5% for 2022 or 1%, excluding the 50 basis point impact from our exit from Russia.  So our net rooms growth for 2022 is likely to be around 3% or 3.5% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We're always looking at opportunities that help broaden the offering for our guests as well as our owners and franchisees. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the City Express brand portfolio. which is currently comprised of 152 hotels with over 17,000 rooms in the CALA region. We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential. Upon closing this transaction, we will immediately gain a significant foothold in this high-growth segment in CALA, while also becoming the largest hotel company in the region.  We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in CALA as well as other locations around the world. If the transaction closes before year-end, our 2022 gross rooms growth could be around 5.5%, and our net rooms growth could be approximately 4%. We really look forward to working with the City Express team. We expect solid rooms growth going forward, given the attractiveness of our portfolio of global brands, our powerful loyalty program, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline. While the exact timing will depend on how new construction starts trend from here, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth.  Now before I turn it over to Leeny, I just want to recognize and thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment, passion and resilience. Leeny?\nKathleen Oberg: Thank you, Tony. We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global RevPAR growth. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5%, above pre-pandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPAR for all market types; primary, secondary and tertiary and all brand types from luxury through extended stay was more fully recovered for the first time. With the exception of Asia Pacific, our international regions posted incredibly strong RevPAR growth as restrictions across most countries fully lifted. Europe, in particular, benefited from a large increase in U.S. leisure demand, thanks to the strong dollar.  Compared to 2019, third quarter RevPAR rose 6% in Europe, nearly 19% in the Middle East and Africa and nearly 18% in CALA. RevPAR is still lagging behind 2019 levels in Greater China and in our Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC region. Greater China improved the most in the quarter with RevPAR 23% below 2019, 30 percentage points better than a quarter ago. However, the recovery there remains uneven given China's renewed commitment to its strict 0 COVID policy. The good news is that we continue to see that when a market reopens for domestic travel after a lockdown, lodging demand rebounds very quickly.  In APAC, South Korea joined India and Australia in crossing the full recovery mark, but this was offset by Japan's borders remaining closed until the end of the quarter. Third quarter RevPAR in APAC was 14% below pre-pandemic levels, an 8 percentage point improvement from a quarter ago. As we move through the fourth quarter, APAC is benefiting from a recovery in airlift in Japan's now open orders. Three quarter -- third quarter total gross fees of $1.1 billion rose 11% compared to 2019, exceeding the top end of our guidance.  Growth was driven by RevPAR improvement and room additions as well as another quarter of strong non-RevPAR related fees. Those fees totaled $192 million in the third quarter, largely aided by ongoing growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose 22% year-over-year. The strength of our industry-leading luxury portfolio also contributed significantly to fee growth in the quarter. Gross fees from our luxury properties were up 13% versus the same quarter in 2019, even with Greater China's weaker performance. While our luxury properties account for 21% of our managed rooms, they contributed 34% of our total incentive management fees in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA also exceeded the high end of our guidance, outpacing the same quarter in 2019 by 9%. With the strong U.S. dollar, foreign exchange net of hedging, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $22 million in the quarter, some of which was included in our guidance a quarter ago. This negative currency translation was more than made up for by the positive impact from increased U.S. leisure travel abroad. We estimate net of our hedges, a 100 basis point change in the U.S. dollar could affect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA by less than $10 million.  G&A and other expenses totaled $216 million in the third quarter, better than our guidance, largely reflecting lower-than-expected administrative costs and bad debt. At the hotel level, we remain focused on containing operating costs for our owners and franchisees while also delivering superior service to our guests. With ADR of 15% above 2019 and our significant productivity enhancements, third quarter profit margins at our U.S. and Canada managed hotels were 2 full percentage points above 2019 levels despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Wage and benefit growth while still high, continued to moderate in the third quarter.  Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance, the details of which are in our press release. As we headed into the end of the year, we're very pleased with the strong continued momentum in our business. Group's transient bookings are showing further gains against 2019. In both the U.S. and Canada and internationally, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR compared to pre-pandemic levels to accelerate from the third quarter, even with anticipated weaker demand in Greater China. Compared to 2019, fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 4% to 6% in the U.S. and Canada, be down 2% to flat internationally and increase 2% to 4% globally.  Worldwide fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 27% to 29% over fourth quarter 2021. We're still working through our 2023 budgets and recognize that there is heightened macro uncertainty. That said, we currently think 2023 global RevPAR could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison given the impact of the Omicron variant in early 2022. For full year 2022, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $880 million to $890 million, slightly better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower bad debt expense. We're also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA of around $3.79 billion at the midpoint of the range, which is 6% higher than our prior full peak year in 2019. Due to the timing of some capital expenditures for owned, leased hotels and corporate systems as well as key money payments, we now expect full year investment spending of closer to $500 million, assuming the City Express transaction does not close in 2022. Strong spending on our credit cards is expected to result in loyalty being a slight source of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. Year-to-date, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, a significant increase of nearly $1.2 billion compared to the first 3 quarters of last year, a strong reminder of the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was excellent at the low end of investment grade targets. With our solid financial results and cash flow generations, we have already returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through October 31, and we now expect to return more than $2.7 billion to shareholders this year. In closing, we're incredibly proud of how well our business is performing and how resilient our business has proven to be. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Tony, probably wanted to start with you, if we could. One thing that's been a bit of a theme, and you hit on it as well through your commentary was just how strong the development environment has held up and I'm wondering if you could unpack that for us a little bit, just given we continue to hear about rising financing costs, a little bit more stress in some of the commercial real estate markets, and that contrasts pretty greatly with what you kind of implied in your comments about just how well your signings are going and your activities going, so can you help us square that up a little bit and just talk about what you're seeing on the ground?\nAnthony Capuano: Of course. So on the signing side, we continue to see strong development committee volume. We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we're seeing in the debt markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S. is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shovels in the ground but we're quite encouraged about the consistency we've seen in the volume of under-construction projects in our pipeline. In fact, we were looking at it over the last few days. As you saw in our release, we continue to have a little over 200,000 rooms under construction.  It's actually the 20th straight quarter where we had more than 200,000 rooms under construction globally. The market in China is most certainly -- where we're seeing the most challenges. The disproportionate share of our projects in the pipeline in China, in fact, about 60% are in the luxury and upper -- upscale tier, principally in primary markets, which are -- well, the combination of those quality tiers in those markets caused those projects to be the most significant fee generators, but they are more complex development projects, and it takes a little longer for them to get open in a market like China. But broadly, we continue to see really powerful interest in our portfolio of brands. And we're maybe most encouraged by the volume both on signings and openings in the conversion tier.\nShaun Kelley: That's great. And then maybe as my follow-up, Leeny, you mentioned, I believe, as you're looking out to 2023 RevPAR that it could increase nicely and you said each quarter, positive versus this year. Could you just talk a little bit about again very high-level assumptions behind that. I know no one's got a crystal ball here, but just how did you kind of -- how do you consider the macro when you think about that outlook and maybe some of the pluses or minuses that could factor into that?\nKathleen Oberg: Yes, sure. Thanks, Shaun. As you say, there obviously continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about the possible recession given the Fed's continued rise in rates and economic headwinds that do continue to grow. But I think we've got some things in our business that really do lead us to confidence about 2023, although we are not predicting per se a recession. We clearly believe there does continue to be pent-up travel demand, particularly in parts of the world where the borders are just opening. We're also seeing just generally a desire for travel and services as compared to goods, which we do see strongly in leisure. Also see, as we think about kind of the overall macro environment that there is pent-up savings for the consumer.  So we'll have to see. But again, from where we sit right now and as we look into the booking trends moving into 2023, we continue to see strength across all the business segments, Shaun. And then the last thing I would say is the reality is our booking window is still short. So at roughly 3 weeks for transient bookings, things could change relatively quickly. But for the signs that we see right now, we feel good about 2023. Obviously, Q1 is a particularly hopeful item given we had Omicron in the first quarter of 2022.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff: I was hoping you could talk about 2023 group business on the books for next year? And maybe talk about it maybe a little bit differently than maybe how you've talked about it in the past. I was just wondering how much of group for 2023 is on the books for sure as a percentage of what you anticipate the total to be? And then maybe you can just talk about in segments in terms of when that was booked, so to get a sense of pricing, how much of '23 group was booked in '22? How much of it was booked in '21? How much it was booked prior to '21? And obviously, how much would you anticipate in the year, for the year, just given the relative strength of group of late?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, of course. So let me start macro and then I'll try to get a little more precise in reference to your specific question. 2023 group revenue on the book is currently pacing down about 11% relative to '19, although candidly, you heard Leeny's comments about the short booking window on transient, a similarly short booking window on group. And so I don't know that looking at that down 11% is particularly relevant. Even for Q4 this year, we're up 4%, and we think that will likely improve through the quarter, given the strength of short-term bookings and the trade that many of our customers are making for flexibility and they're willing to pay a higher rate.  When I look deeper into what's on the books for 2023, room nights are down in the high teens. ADR is actually up close to about 10%. And then I think your second question was really about when that business is being booked? I guess I'll try to give you some 2022 data that is hopefully indicative of the trends we're seeing. About 50% of the group business we've seen year-to-date in 2022 was booked in the year, for the year. That's about double what we saw pre-pandemic, where typically, we'd see about 25% of our total group volume being booked in the year, for the year.\nJoseph Greff: Great. And then, Leeny, we heard your comments, obviously, about broad expectations for 2023 RevPAR growth. How do you think non-RevPAR-related fees performed relative to that RevPAR growth expectation? Would you expect it to be similar? Would you expect it to be plus or minus? How do you think about that?\nKathleen Oberg: So we're in the middle of our budget process, Joe. So we obviously aren't getting to where we're talking about specifics on RevPAR growth of '23 over '22. I think what we've seen this year is credit card fees frankly being up over 20% year-to-date this year. And I think for the full year, obviously, our guidance implies the same. So I think you'll continue to see growth in the cardholders and then growth in spend. But whether it matches exactly RevPAR, we're not in a position to say specifically.  Obviously, when you look at compared to '19, those credit card fees have grown meaningfully more than hotel-related fees because of COVID and the steady growth in cardholders and credit card spend each and every year as we've moved through 2019. But I -- again, broadly speaking, we are looking at growth of non-RevPAR fees in 2023, both from credit cardholders as well as spend. But the relative array of growth compared to RevPAR, we will get closer to as we move through the budget process, but we're looking for healthy growth in both.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: I was curious about the acquisition that you made in October and you talked about expanding in the mid-scale segment in the CALA region with that brand. Do you have thoughts about the mid-scale segment in the U.S., not necessarily with that brand, but in some other brands that maybe we don't know about yet.\nAnthony Capuano: Yes. Of course. So as we mentioned in the release on the acquisition, and I think, I at least touched on this in my prepared remarks, the acquisition initially is focused on the CALA region. We are equally excited about the growth prospects for mid-scale across CALA and what this transaction does for us in terms of further strengthening our footprint across this really important region. As with many acquisitions that we've done over the years, once we close, once we start rolling in CALA, we will, of course, evaluate the applicability of this platform as to whether it makes sense to roll out some or all of the sub-brands under the City Express banner into other markets around the world. But right now, we're focused on getting the transaction closed.\nRobin Farley: But in general, is the mid-scale segment in the U.S., something whether it's that brand or not, that you kind of have your sight set on?\nAnthony Capuano: Well, as you know, we are not in the mid-scale segment in the U.S. Certainly, this acquisition gives us the opportunity to evaluate whether it makes sense to enter mid-scale in any other market inclusive of the U.S.\nRobin Farley: And then just 1 follow-up on the -- your comments about the pipeline growth in rooms under construction. And you mentioned that it's been a very steady sort of rooms under construction in the last few quarters, you're steadily above that 200,000 unit rate. Is there -- can you give us a little bit of insight into sort of new construction starts in the U.S. only because sort of the broader U.S. market seems to be a slowing number of new construction starts in the hotel space. So just wondering how that -- the sort of incremental hotel starts looks?\nAnthony Capuano: Of course. So again, outside of Greater China, which is quite a volatile environment, we're pretty encouraged about what we're seeing around the world in terms of new construction starts. We are certainly not back to the peak of 2019, but as I mentioned earlier, new construction starts in the U.S. and Canada reached the highest quarterly level we've seen since the start of the pandemic.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask a little bit about net unit growth as well going forward, just probably remains difficult for developers to kind of access capital. And I'm just wondering, do you see Marriott providing more of a backstop to developers either through loan guarantees or just direct financing?\nAnthony Capuano: Sure, of course. So as both Leeny and I referenced, the availability of debt, particularly for new construction here in our biggest market is a bit challenging. The good news is the pipeline continues to be strong. We continue to see fallout from the pipeline below our historical averages. As has always been the case in constricted debt markets, brand affiliation, track record of the developer, strength of the sponsorship are what -- are the factors that capture the construction debt that is, in fact, available. And so we see signs that the strength of our brands continue to capture a disproportionate share of what's out there.  A quarter or so ago, we announced closing on the financing for a $1.2 billion Gaylord Pacific Hotel in Chula Vista, California. This quarter, we announced the closing on financing for a new Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Papagayo, in Costa Rica. So we do feel like we are grabbing meaningful share of the dollars that are out there. And I'm sorry, Smedes, what was the second part of your question? Oh, on key money?\nKathleen Oberg: Well, yes.\nAnthony Capuano: Yes. Maybe I'll take a high-level shot at this, and Leeny can jump in with some more color. I don't see our tried-and-true philosophical approach to investment in projects changing even in this environment. Certainly, the competitive environment gets more competitive by the day, but we will use the say -- or apply the same disciplined lens that we've applied in the past. And among the long list of reasons, we'll continue to take that approach over the years when you look at the projects where we've leveraged the company's balance sheet to get to accelerate growth, those are projects that tend to generate outsized fee volumes.\nKathleen Oberg: The only thing I'd add is that we are not seeing that we are increasing our financing support or investment support in a meaningful way for deals. I think at the end of the day, the first mortgage loans that projects are looking for do not typically come from Marriott and that has not changed. In terms of debt service guarantees, operating profit guarantees and key money, I would say we continue to see them in the same kind of frequency and proportion as we've seen in the past.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nCharles Scholes: I know you sort of touched on this and made some implications for next year. When we think about the right net unit growth to model for next year, a number of considerations. Number one, you did see your pipeline tick up a bit from 2Q, but then again, the trajectory of year-over-year quarterly growth has been going down. Is it a fair assumption when we think about the organic number to use that similar to this year's 3% for next year at this point?\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, Patrick. Again, the -- some of the murkiness that's out there causes us to be reluctant to give you a hard number. What I will tell you is we are encouraged by deal volume. We are encouraged by the volume of under-construction projects. And maybe most notably in a debt constricted environment, we are particularly enthusiastic about the volume of conversion deals we're approving and signing, the volume of conversion deals that we're opening, and the volume of conversion discussions we're having, both on individual projects and multiunit opportunities.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: I wanted to ask about IMFs, the release says 2/3 of them were international. Can you just add a little color on what percentage of North American hotels are earning them today? And any qualitative commentary about how that curve might roll out into the future would be helpful.\nKathleen Oberg: Yes, sure. So let's talk about a couple of things. First of all, just from the dollar size, David, we were at $35 million of IMFs or about 1/3 from the U.S. and Canada, and that is pretty similar to what it was in Q3 '19. It was 39%. Now it was 26% of overall hotels in the U.S. and Canada earning incentive fees in Q3 and 56% in '19. But it's important to break out full service from limited service because the reality is that we had a large portfolio back in '19 of managed limited service hotels, which, as you know, left our system over a year ago.  So if you actually look at full service, we're actually at a slightly higher percentage of hotels earning IMFs in full service than we were in '19. And again, as we talked about before, in my comments that you saw house profit margins at our full-service hotels, up 200 basis points compared to '19 with our strong RevPAR performance and really strong efforts on the cost containment side. So I -- we feel good about what's going on. We've talked about -- hoped for expected growth in RevPAR in 2023, both U.S. and internationally, which should bode well for continued progress on incentive fees.  Obviously, wage and benefit growth is something we're keeping an eye on, which has moderated a bit, although it still reflects the fact that we're in an inflationary environment. And then the last thing I'll say is we've continued to see improvement in the large urban markets where we've got a number of managed Full-Service hotels in the U.S. And we've seen nice progress as we moved into Q3 in some of those urban markets, and we expect them to continue on as we move into 2023 with that recovery.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And as my follow-up, the discussions happened during COVID, early on about the fee structures and the interactions between owners and yourselves, around contracts and service delivery, et cetera. And interestingly, it came up with -- in a couple of places from investors recently about what's changed. Now that at least for most of us, COVID is kind of in the rearview mirror. Can you just talk about how that's different and how that's manifesting itself in the numbers?\nKathleen Oberg: So fundamentally, the fee structures have not changed. So I would say, while we did things that on a temporary basis like helped on the reducing reimbursable costs and helping with extensions on accounts receivable, they were all really overwhelmingly temporary things. And then also, if you remember, 85% of the things that we charge are based on top line revenues of the hotel. So they flex as the revenues go up and down, which is helpful to the hotel owners.  I think you see things like what we've talked about on our direct digital bookings, things like that, which do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs as an example, all the productivity efforts that we've done to help improve our productivity per room. We've obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels. But as far as structural changes in the contracts, there's nothing really to look for there.\nAnthony Capuano: And maybe the only thing I would add, we obviously have brought back all of our quality metrics, so our QA audits, our RAN standards, you might think that the owners would baulk at that, I think, quite the contrary. They care deeply about their neighbors within the portfolio and continue to encourage us to bring back and enforce those standards. And then similarly, we obviously gave our owners and franchisees a measure of relief on renovation cycle at the very bottom of the trough of the pandemic.  We're bringing those requirements back but with some pragmatic perspective on hotels that are doing a terrific job on service as evidenced by those quality metrics and giving them the ability to selectively extend some of those renovation cycles.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nWilliam Crow: Tony, we view hotel demand as kind of a lagging economic indicator, maybe 3 or 6 months. I'm curious whether you agree with that? And if so, what is the best, whether it's a consumer view or other economic data points to try and judge the macro change that, that may be a\u2026?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, it's a good question. I would revert -- maybe refer back to some comments that both Leeny and I have made this morning about this extraordinarily short booking window, so probably not as much of a lagging indicator as we might have experienced pre-pandemic. While we are encouraged and optimistic by the forward booking data we see, I think Leeny said it best. We also recognize that we work in an industry that is cyclical and subject to economic cycles.  And because of that short booking window, trends can change quickly. However, even if, in fact, we are in a recession or we fall into a recession, I think the company and travel more broadly are positioned a bit differently. Leeny, maybe you want to talk about that?\nKathleen Oberg: Yes. I think we definitely see that we could perform relatively better than we had in prior recessions. You've definitely got unemployment rates right now that are truly at historic lows. And while certainly what is happening with interest rates would be expected over time to influence that. We are a far cry from the 9.5% that we were in the great recession.  And similarly, when you think about pent-up savings and the desire for people to take and do travel to not assume that they can put it off that they really don't want to postpone it and that there is still both business and leisure trips that families and consumers want to make. And while consumer health is something that we will be watching extremely closely, for the moment, there does look to be some extra room there that could help as we go into a potential recession.\nWilliam Crow: That's helpful. If I could just ask my follow-up question. We understand that owners' meetings recently, the topic of consistency of brand has kind of come up. Is there some complaints about not removing enough rooms from the system, you talked about net unit growth, a low number of removals. Should we expect that to go up over the next couple of years as you get back to kind of enforcing capital spending?\nAnthony Capuano: So maybe I'll take the first part, and Leeny can take the second. As I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of our owners are quite pleased that we've brought back our quality metrics and quality requirements they care, as you point out, meaningfully about the quality of the overall portfolio.  While there may be some pockets of frustration, I think there's also a broad understanding that it was appropriate to suspend those processes during the depths of the pandemic and that it will take us a bit now that they are reinstated to get back to having enough empirical data to be a little firmer on enforcement.\nKathleen Oberg: The only part that I would add is that for the owners who did do some renovations during COVID, I think the results that they're seeing are powerful. And I think our good incentive for other owners to do the same. We did -- as Tony mentioned, we did give owners a bit of a pass in the heart of COVID to help everybody manage through the pandemic. But I think as we are coming out of it, I think the entire industry recognizes the importance of having both product and service up to where our consumers, our guests expect them to be given the prices that people are paying.  So we do expect there to be additional renovations and frankly, probably a pickup in renovations now that we're largely through that impact and believe that the returns on those renovations will be strong. For the time being, we certainly continue to see that our -- we expect our deletion rate to stay in this 1% to 1.5% rate that we've talked about for several years. We will, as we get into the new year, refine that a bit as we go through the entire budget process. But I think that sort of range should be your expectation.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: So maybe -- so when you think about corporate transient recovery and specifically focusing on your largest accounts, the larger corporates in the U.S., what is the tone that you kind of get back from them when you talk to them about how they're planning for the future. Obviously, we know that near term, you're seeing good trends, but we hear and see headlines regarding -- especially in tech some larger companies pulling back on expenses and things like that. I'm just curious how you feel about some of those things?\nAnthony Capuano: Sure. So at a macro level, we are, again, encouraged by the sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in business transient. You'll recall that in the U.S. and Canada, BT was down almost 25% in the first quarter. That dropped to 13% in Q2 and just down 11% in Q3. As we've discussed in the past, small- and medium-sized companies, which are about 60% of those BT room nights are fully recovered. And in fact, in Q3, their room nights were up about 10%.  When you pivot to the larger companies, your comments are right. Special corporate, which tends to be a lot of those big companies, their room nights were down about 17% in the quarter. And when you start to look at the specific tiers within special corporate, you brought up tech as an example. They were down about 23% in the quarter. Trying to respond more qualitatively in terms of what we're hearing from them. I think it's really embedded in the short booking window. They absolutely talk about the value of face-to-face interaction with each other, with their customers, with their clients.  But they are also, again, much like our group customers willing to trade a bit of pricing for flexibility. And then the last thing I would say to try to address your question, we are relatively early in the special corporate rate negotiations. But what we're seeing in terms of the pricing and our growing confidence that we're going to end up at least with high single-digit year-over-year rates is pretty encouraging as well.\nBrandt Montour: Great. I appreciate it. And then on conversion activity, which you guys did talk about and hoping to ask it in a slightly different way. But just given the sort of counter cyclicality of that activity in past cycles, and sort of one would think maybe that we're sort of at the tail end of conversion activity that was elevated because of COVID, but maybe that there's some -- a pickup -- there could be a pickup of conversion activity if we went into another -- if we went into a recession. Is that how you think about it at this point?\nAnthony Capuano: It's not. It's not. I think the reality is a couple of factors are in play here that give us even more confidence about the runway we have for conversions. I think number 1 for Marriott, we've never had a better stack of conversion-friendly brands and across multiple quality tiers, which is really encouraging for us. Number two, we talked a bit about the constriction in the debt markets. There is meaningfully, not meaningfully -- relatively more debt available for existing assets than there is new construction but the same lenses from the lender's perspective apply, brand affiliation, track record.  And so in order to source the debt that is available for existing assets, I think you see existing owners and buyers of assets thinking longer and harder about brand affiliation. And then I think third, I mentioned this in response to 1 of the earlier questions, the uptick we've seen in multiunit conversion discussions is a little different than what we've seen at the tail end of other cycles.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Nice to speak with you. On the business transient commentary, which I think you said down 11%, I wondered if you could provide some regional color. Where would you mark that recovery across the geographies that you touch? And then just as we think about the shape of that recovery curve, we've seen some nice sequential improvement here, but should we be thinking about a plateau through early next year when we have new sort of budget cycles? Or are there regions where you still think sort of sequential improvement into 4Q on BT is on the table?\nKathleen Oberg: Sure. So let's talk -- I'm going to reference back to Tony's comments about where roughly 60% of our BT in Q3 was from small- and medium-sized companies. And that, frankly, is sprinkled all over the country. So that's going to be everywhere from New York to Tulsa to smaller markets that are -- at limited-service hotels rather than -- the larger special corporate accounts obviously are more headquartered in the urban large cities.  The thing I will say is we've continued to see progress as we move too along. When you think of, for example, you think of New York City, which has moved quite nicely during the year, with the improvement in BT, where they were down 29% in Q1. Today New York City was actually 3% higher in Q3 than 2019. So I think you will continue to see the progress, the trends in BT are similar, both internationally as well as in the U.S. I do think as we move into 2023, a lot of this world depend on the state of the economy. So kind of having a prediction about exactly where BT will go, it is tough to pinpoint.  We do look for continued improvement and think it will ultimately get back to where it was, but the exact timing of that hard to say. And then the last thing I'll point out is just the reality that we have seen it moderate in terms of its rate of improvement as we've moved into Q3, and I would expect to see that moderation continue.\nOperator: And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back to Tony Capuano for any closing remarks.\nAnthony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you all again for joining us this morning. Thanks for your continued interest in Marriott. Get back on the road, we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day.\nKathleen Oberg: Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We had an outstanding third quarter. Quarter rose above 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began, up nearly 2%. RevPAR compared to 2019 improved sequentially from the second quarter in every region around the world. Global occupancy rose to 69% while ADR outpaced by 2019, excuse me, by a remarkable 10%. Compared to prepandemic levels, worldwide RevPAR in September reached a new monthly high watermark, increasing more than 4% or nearly 7%, excluding Greater China.  During the quarter, leisure demand remained strong, well above 2019 levels. In the U.S. and Canada, Full-Service group revenue for the quarter showed continued growth, ending up 3% over the same quarter in 2019. Fourth quarter Full-Service group revenue is currently pacing up 4%, but is likely to improve further given the strong last-minute group bookings that we've seen all year. The trend towards last-minute bookings has led to meaningful compression in pricing power, helping group ADR for new bookings rise each quarter this year.  At our managed hotels in the U.S., ADR for in-the-year, for-the-year group bookings made in the third quarter rose 17% compared to same year bookings made in the 2019, 3rd quarter. A significant jump from the 6% increase we saw in the first quarter. ADR for group bookings made in the third quarter for 2023 outpaced 2019, 3rd quarter bookings for events in 2000 by 24%. Business transient demand also continued to improve during the quarter, although it still lags 2019 levels. Third quarter business transient room nights in the U.S. and Canada were 11% below 2019. We are currently in the midst of our special corporate negotiations for 2023 and are very pleased with how they're progressing. After 2 years of holding rates steady, the early results look positive for at least high single-digit year-over-year rate growth. Third quarter day-of-the-week trends continue to suggest that travelers are combining leisure and business trips. In fact, the average length of a transient business trip has increased meaningfully, and year-to-date is up more than 15% compared to 2019. With borders reopened in most countries around the world, rising cross-border travel helped spur demand during the quarter, especially in Europe and in the Caribbean and Latin America or CALA region. Cross-border guests accounted for 15% of our global room nights in the third quarter, an uptick from 12% in the first quarter of this year. In 2019, 18% of travel to our properties was from cross-border guests. So we anticipate additional upside from international travel especially from Greater China once stringent travel restrictions are relaxed.  Given rapidly rising interest rates and growing concerns about a possible global recession, we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends. There is no doubt that the hospitality industry is impacted by economic cycles. And with transient booking windows averaging only about 3 weeks, trends could change relatively quickly. However, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. In fact, we've seen just the opposite. Booking trends remain very healthy. Given sustained high levels of employment, consumer trends prioritizing experiences versus goods, pent-up travel demand and a high level of consumer savings, travel spending has been incredibly resilient.  In October, demand remained strong across our regions, with the exception of Greater China, where trends are still low. Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy program grew to 173 million members at the end of the third quarter. The program achieved record penetration levels in the quarter reaching 60% in the U.S. and Canada and 53% globally. Members also continued to engage with our co-brand credit cards, which had another solid quarter. After recently making significant enhancements by adding new benefits to many of our U.S. cards, sign-ups have well exceeded expectations.  This led to record new cardholder acquisitions as well as record spending for the first 9 months of this year. We also introduced 2 mid-tier cards at the end of September, which should help drive strong growth going forward. While much smaller fee contributors that are U.S. co-brand cards, we have similarly seen record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spend. This has been particularly driven by China, where we've had great traction after launching our first cards there in July. Our Bonvoy members have been increasingly interacting with the platform through our direct digital channels, which helps boost owner and franchisee profitability. Since 2019, our share of room nights booked through direct digital channels has increased more than 5 percentage points to 38% while our distribution through OTAs has risen by less than 1 percentage point to 12%.  The power of Bonvoy in our direct channels has also been evident in our latest offering, the Ritz-Carlton Yacht which made its inaugural voyage from Barcelona last month. Remarkably, around 2/3 of all bookings for this incredible brand extension have been through direct channels, which is many times above the rates most cruise companies experience. Additionally, Bonvoy members account for more than half of the Yacht bookings. We look forward to more ships joining the portfolio in the future.  Shifting to the development front, our pipeline grew for the fourth quarter in a row, totaling more than 502,000 rooms by the end of the third quarter. Signing activity in the quarter remained healthy in most regions of the world. Our development team continues to be laser focused on conversions, a particularly bright spot in the development story. Conversions represented 21% of room signings and 27% of room openings in the quarter. We are very enthusiastic about the level of conversations on conversions, including for multiunit conversion opportunities.  Outside the Greater China, we were pleased to see new construction starts pick up nicely in the third quarter. While not yet back to 2019 levels, new construction starts in the U.S. reached the highest quarterly level since the pandemic began. For full year 2022, we now expect gross rooms growth of approximately 4.5% compared to our prior expectation of closer to 5%. The change is primarily a result of fewer expected openings in Greater China as the lockdowns there have extended construction time lines. The good news is that we have not seen deals in Greater China or in any of our regions falling out of the pipeline at a higher than usual rate. With just 2 months left in the year, we now expect deletions at the bottom end of our prior guidance. Deletions could be about 1.5% for 2022 or 1%, excluding the 50 basis point impact from our exit from Russia.  So our net rooms growth for 2022 is likely to be around 3% or 3.5% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We're always looking at opportunities that help broaden the offering for our guests as well as our owners and franchisees. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the City Express brand portfolio. which is currently comprised of 152 hotels with over 17,000 rooms in the CALA region. We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential. Upon closing this transaction, we will immediately gain a significant foothold in this high-growth segment in CALA, while also becoming the largest hotel company in the region.  We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to expand in this segment in CALA as well as other locations around the world. If the transaction closes before year-end, our 2022 gross rooms growth could be around 5.5%, and our net rooms growth could be approximately 4%. We really look forward to working with the City Express team. We expect solid rooms growth going forward, given the attractiveness of our portfolio of global brands, our powerful loyalty program, our momentum around conversions and our industry-leading pipeline. While the exact timing will depend on how new construction starts trend from here, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth.  Now before I turn it over to Leeny, I just want to recognize and thank our associates around the world for their continued commitment, passion and resilience. Leeny? Of course. So on the signing side, we continue to see strong development committee volume. We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we're seeing in the debt markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S. is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shovels in the ground but we're quite encouraged about the consistency we've seen in the volume of under-construction projects in our pipeline. In fact, we were looking at it over the last few days. As you saw in our release, we continue to have a little over 200,000 rooms under construction.  It's actually the 20th straight quarter where we had more than 200,000 rooms under construction globally. The market in China is most certainly -- where we're seeing the most challenges. The disproportionate share of our projects in the pipeline in China, in fact, about 60% are in the luxury and upper -- upscale tier, principally in primary markets, which are -- well, the combination of those quality tiers in those markets caused those projects to be the most significant fee generators, but they are more complex development projects, and it takes a little longer for them to get open in a market like China. But broadly, we continue to see really powerful interest in our portfolio of brands. And we're maybe most encouraged by the volume both on signings and openings in the conversion tier. Yes, of course. So let me start macro and then I'll try to get a little more precise in reference to your specific question. 2023 group revenue on the book is currently pacing down about 11% relative to '19, although candidly, you heard Leeny's comments about the short booking window on transient, a similarly short booking window on group. And so I don't know that looking at that down 11% is particularly relevant. Even for Q4 this year, we're up 4%, and we think that will likely improve through the quarter, given the strength of short-term bookings and the trade that many of our customers are making for flexibility and they're willing to pay a higher rate.  When I look deeper into what's on the books for 2023, room nights are down in the high teens. ADR is actually up close to about 10%. And then I think your second question was really about when that business is being booked? I guess I'll try to give you some 2022 data that is hopefully indicative of the trends we're seeing. About 50% of the group business we've seen year-to-date in 2022 was booked in the year, for the year. That's about double what we saw pre-pandemic, where typically, we'd see about 25% of our total group volume being booked in the year, for the year. Yes. Of course. So as we mentioned in the release on the acquisition, and I think, I at least touched on this in my prepared remarks, the acquisition initially is focused on the CALA region. We are equally excited about the growth prospects for mid-scale across CALA and what this transaction does for us in terms of further strengthening our footprint across this really important region. As with many acquisitions that we've done over the years, once we close, once we start rolling in CALA, we will, of course, evaluate the applicability of this platform as to whether it makes sense to roll out some or all of the sub-brands under the City Express banner into other markets around the world. But right now, we're focused on getting the transaction closed. Well, as you know, we are not in the mid-scale segment in the U.S. Certainly, this acquisition gives us the opportunity to evaluate whether it makes sense to enter mid-scale in any other market inclusive of the U.S. Of course. So again, outside of Greater China, which is quite a volatile environment, we're pretty encouraged about what we're seeing around the world in terms of new construction starts. We are certainly not back to the peak of 2019, but as I mentioned earlier, new construction starts in the U.S. and Canada reached the highest quarterly level we've seen since the start of the pandemic. Sure, of course. So as both Leeny and I referenced, the availability of debt, particularly for new construction here in our biggest market is a bit challenging. The good news is the pipeline continues to be strong. We continue to see fallout from the pipeline below our historical averages. As has always been the case in constricted debt markets, brand affiliation, track record of the developer, strength of the sponsorship are what -- are the factors that capture the construction debt that is, in fact, available. And so we see signs that the strength of our brands continue to capture a disproportionate share of what's out there.  A quarter or so ago, we announced closing on the financing for a $1.2 billion Gaylord Pacific Hotel in Chula Vista, California. This quarter, we announced the closing on financing for a new Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Papagayo, in Costa Rica. So we do feel like we are grabbing meaningful share of the dollars that are out there. And I'm sorry, Smedes, what was the second part of your question? Oh, on key money? Yes. Maybe I'll take a high-level shot at this, and Leeny can jump in with some more color. I don't see our tried-and-true philosophical approach to investment in projects changing even in this environment. Certainly, the competitive environment gets more competitive by the day, but we will use the say -- or apply the same disciplined lens that we've applied in the past. And among the long list of reasons, we'll continue to take that approach over the years when you look at the projects where we've leveraged the company's balance sheet to get to accelerate growth, those are projects that tend to generate outsized fee volumes. Thank you, Patrick. Again, the -- some of the murkiness that's out there causes us to be reluctant to give you a hard number. What I will tell you is we are encouraged by deal volume. We are encouraged by the volume of under-construction projects. And maybe most notably in a debt constricted environment, we are particularly enthusiastic about the volume of conversion deals we're approving and signing, the volume of conversion deals that we're opening, and the volume of conversion discussions we're having, both on individual projects and multiunit opportunities. And maybe the only thing I would add, we obviously have brought back all of our quality metrics, so our QA audits, our RAN standards, you might think that the owners would baulk at that, I think, quite the contrary. They care deeply about their neighbors within the portfolio and continue to encourage us to bring back and enforce those standards. And then similarly, we obviously gave our owners and franchisees a measure of relief on renovation cycle at the very bottom of the trough of the pandemic.  We're bringing those requirements back but with some pragmatic perspective on hotels that are doing a terrific job on service as evidenced by those quality metrics and giving them the ability to selectively extend some of those renovation cycles. Yes, it's a good question. I would revert -- maybe refer back to some comments that both Leeny and I have made this morning about this extraordinarily short booking window, so probably not as much of a lagging indicator as we might have experienced pre-pandemic. While we are encouraged and optimistic by the forward booking data we see, I think Leeny said it best. We also recognize that we work in an industry that is cyclical and subject to economic cycles.  And because of that short booking window, trends can change quickly. However, even if, in fact, we are in a recession or we fall into a recession, I think the company and travel more broadly are positioned a bit differently. Leeny, maybe you want to talk about that? So maybe I'll take the first part, and Leeny can take the second. As I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of our owners are quite pleased that we've brought back our quality metrics and quality requirements they care, as you point out, meaningfully about the quality of the overall portfolio.  While there may be some pockets of frustration, I think there's also a broad understanding that it was appropriate to suspend those processes during the depths of the pandemic and that it will take us a bit now that they are reinstated to get back to having enough empirical data to be a little firmer on enforcement. Sure. So at a macro level, we are, again, encouraged by the sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement in business transient. You'll recall that in the U.S. and Canada, BT was down almost 25% in the first quarter. That dropped to 13% in Q2 and just down 11% in Q3. As we've discussed in the past, small- and medium-sized companies, which are about 60% of those BT room nights are fully recovered. And in fact, in Q3, their room nights were up about 10%.  When you pivot to the larger companies, your comments are right. Special corporate, which tends to be a lot of those big companies, their room nights were down about 17% in the quarter. And when you start to look at the specific tiers within special corporate, you brought up tech as an example. They were down about 23% in the quarter. Trying to respond more qualitatively in terms of what we're hearing from them. I think it's really embedded in the short booking window.

But they are also, again, much like our group customers willing to trade a bit of pricing for flexibility. And then the last thing I would say to try to address your question, we are relatively early in the special corporate rate negotiations. But what we're seeing in terms of the pricing and our growing confidence that we're going to end up at least with high single-digit year-over-year rates is pretty encouraging as well. It's not. It's not. I think the reality is a couple of factors are in play here that give us even more confidence about the runway we have for conversions. I think number 1 for Marriott, we've never had a better stack of conversion-friendly brands and across multiple quality tiers, which is really encouraging for us. Number two, we talked a bit about the constriction in the debt markets. There is meaningfully, not meaningfully -- relatively more debt available for existing assets than there is new construction but the same lenses from the lender's perspective apply, brand affiliation, track record.  And so in order to source the debt that is available for existing assets, I think you see existing owners and buyers of assets thinking longer and harder about brand affiliation. And then I think third, I mentioned this in response to 1 of the earlier questions, the uptick we've seen in multiunit conversion discussions is a little different than what we've seen at the tail end of other cycles. Great. Well, thank you all again for joining us this morning. Thanks for your continued interest in Marriott. Get back on the road, we look forward to seeing you in our hotels in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. We had excellent financial performance again this quarter, driven by continued momentum in global RevPAR growth. In the U.S. and Canada, third quarter RevPAR was 3.5%, above pre-pandemic levels with ADR surpassing 2019 by more than 10%. RevPAR for all market types; primary, secondary and tertiary and all brand types from luxury through extended stay was more fully recovered for the first time. With the exception of Asia Pacific, our international regions posted incredibly strong RevPAR growth as restrictions across most countries fully lifted. Europe, in particular, benefited from a large increase in U.S. leisure demand, thanks to the strong dollar.  Compared to 2019, third quarter RevPAR rose 6% in Europe, nearly 19% in the Middle East and Africa and nearly 18% in CALA. RevPAR is still lagging behind 2019 levels in Greater China and in our Asia Pacific, excluding China or APAC region. Greater China improved the most in the quarter with RevPAR 23% below 2019, 30 percentage points better than a quarter ago. However, the recovery there remains uneven given China's renewed commitment to its strict 0 COVID policy. The good news is that we continue to see that when a market reopens for domestic travel after a lockdown, lodging demand rebounds very quickly.  In APAC, South Korea joined India and Australia in crossing the full recovery mark, but this was offset by Japan's borders remaining closed until the end of the quarter. Third quarter RevPAR in APAC was 14% below pre-pandemic levels, an 8 percentage point improvement from a quarter ago. As we move through the fourth quarter, APAC is benefiting from a recovery in airlift in Japan's now open orders. Three quarter -- third quarter total gross fees of $1.1 billion rose 11% compared to 2019, exceeding the top end of our guidance.  Growth was driven by RevPAR improvement and room additions as well as another quarter of strong non-RevPAR related fees. Those fees totaled $192 million in the third quarter, largely aided by ongoing growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose 22% year-over-year. The strength of our industry-leading luxury portfolio also contributed significantly to fee growth in the quarter. Gross fees from our luxury properties were up 13% versus the same quarter in 2019, even with Greater China's weaker performance. While our luxury properties account for 21% of our managed rooms, they contributed 34% of our total incentive management fees in the third quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA also exceeded the high end of our guidance, outpacing the same quarter in 2019 by 9%. With the strong U.S. dollar, foreign exchange net of hedging, negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $22 million in the quarter, some of which was included in our guidance a quarter ago. This negative currency translation was more than made up for by the positive impact from increased U.S. leisure travel abroad. We estimate net of our hedges, a 100 basis point change in the U.S. dollar could affect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA by less than $10 million.  G&A and other expenses totaled $216 million in the third quarter, better than our guidance, largely reflecting lower-than-expected administrative costs and bad debt. At the hotel level, we remain focused on containing operating costs for our owners and franchisees while also delivering superior service to our guests. With ADR of 15% above 2019 and our significant productivity enhancements, third quarter profit margins at our U.S. and Canada managed hotels were 2 full percentage points above 2019 levels despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. Wage and benefit growth while still high, continued to moderate in the third quarter.  Let me now turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance, the details of which are in our press release. As we headed into the end of the year, we're very pleased with the strong continued momentum in our business. Group's transient bookings are showing further gains against 2019. In both the U.S. and Canada and internationally, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR compared to pre-pandemic levels to accelerate from the third quarter, even with anticipated weaker demand in Greater China. Compared to 2019, fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 4% to 6% in the U.S. and Canada, be down 2% to flat internationally and increase 2% to 4% globally.  Worldwide fourth quarter RevPAR could increase 27% to 29% over fourth quarter 2021. We're still working through our 2023 budgets and recognize that there is heightened macro uncertainty. That said, we currently think 2023 global RevPAR could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison given the impact of the Omicron variant in early 2022. For full year 2022, we're now anticipating G&A expenses of $880 million to $890 million, slightly better than our prior guidance, primarily due to lower bad debt expense. We're also raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect adjusted EBITDA of around $3.79 billion at the midpoint of the range, which is 6% higher than our prior full peak year in 2019. Due to the timing of some capital expenditures for owned, leased hotels and corporate systems as well as key money payments, we now expect full year investment spending of closer to $500 million, assuming the City Express transaction does not close in 2022. Strong spending on our credit cards is expected to result in loyalty being a slight source of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. Year-to-date, our net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion, a significant increase of nearly $1.2 billion compared to the first 3 quarters of last year, a strong reminder of the power of our asset-light business model. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was excellent at the low end of investment grade targets. With our solid financial results and cash flow generations, we have already returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends through October 31, and we now expect to return more than $2.7 billion to shareholders this year. In closing, we're incredibly proud of how well our business is performing and how resilient our business has proven to be. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes, sure. Thanks, Shaun. As you say, there obviously continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty about the possible recession given the Fed's continued rise in rates and economic headwinds that do continue to grow. But I think we've got some things in our business that really do lead us to confidence about 2023, although we are not predicting per se a recession. We clearly believe there does continue to be pent-up travel demand, particularly in parts of the world where the borders are just opening. We're also seeing just generally a desire for travel and services as compared to goods, which we do see strongly in leisure. Also see, as we think about kind of the overall macro environment that there is pent-up savings for the consumer.  So we'll have to see. But again, from where we sit right now and as we look into the booking trends moving into 2023, we continue to see strength across all the business segments, Shaun. And then the last thing I would say is the reality is our booking window is still short. So at roughly 3 weeks for transient bookings, things could change relatively quickly. But for the signs that we see right now, we feel good about 2023. Obviously, Q1 is a particularly hopeful item given we had Omicron in the first quarter of 2022. So we're in the middle of our budget process, Joe. So we obviously aren't getting to where we're talking about specifics on RevPAR growth of '23 over '22. I think what we've seen this year is credit card fees frankly being up over 20% year-to-date this year. And I think for the full year, obviously, our guidance implies the same. So I think you'll continue to see growth in the cardholders and then growth in spend. But whether it matches exactly RevPAR, we're not in a position to say specifically.  Obviously, when you look at compared to '19, those credit card fees have grown meaningfully more than hotel-related fees because of COVID and the steady growth in cardholders and credit card spend each and every year as we've moved through 2019. But I -- again, broadly speaking, we are looking at growth of non-RevPAR fees in 2023, both from credit cardholders as well as spend. But the relative array of growth compared to RevPAR, we will get closer to as we move through the budget process, but we're looking for healthy growth in both. Well, yes. The only thing I'd add is that we are not seeing that we are increasing our financing support or investment support in a meaningful way for deals. I think at the end of the day, the first mortgage loans that projects are looking for do not typically come from Marriott and that has not changed. In terms of debt service guarantees, operating profit guarantees and key money, I would say we continue to see them in the same kind of frequency and proportion as we've seen in the past. Yes, sure. So let's talk about a couple of things. First of all, just from the dollar size, David, we were at $35 million of IMFs or about 1/3 from the U.S. and Canada, and that is pretty similar to what it was in Q3 '19. It was 39%. Now it was 26% of overall hotels in the U.S. and Canada earning incentive fees in Q3 and 56% in '19. But it's important to break out full service from limited service because the reality is that we had a large portfolio back in '19 of managed limited service hotels, which, as you know, left our system over a year ago.  So if you actually look at full service, we're actually at a slightly higher percentage of hotels earning IMFs in full service than we were in '19. And again, as we talked about before, in my comments that you saw house profit margins at our full-service hotels, up 200 basis points compared to '19 with our strong RevPAR performance and really strong efforts on the cost containment side. So I -- we feel good about what's going on. We've talked about -- hoped for expected growth in RevPAR in 2023, both U.S. and internationally, which should bode well for continued progress on incentive fees.  Obviously, wage and benefit growth is something we're keeping an eye on, which has moderated a bit, although it still reflects the fact that we're in an inflationary environment. And then the last thing I'll say is we've continued to see improvement in the large urban markets where we've got a number of managed Full-Service hotels in the U.S. And we've seen nice progress as we moved into Q3 in some of those urban markets, and we expect them to continue on as we move into 2023 with that recovery. So fundamentally, the fee structures have not changed. So I would say, while we did things that on a temporary basis like helped on the reducing reimbursable costs and helping with extensions on accounts receivable, they were all really overwhelmingly temporary things. And then also, if you remember, 85% of the things that we charge are based on top line revenues of the hotel. So they flex as the revenues go up and down, which is helpful to the hotel owners.  I think you see things like what we've talked about on our direct digital bookings, things like that, which do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs as an example, all the productivity efforts that we've done to help improve our productivity per room. We've obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels. But as far as structural changes in the contracts, there's nothing really to look for there. Yes. I think we definitely see that we could perform relatively better than we had in prior recessions. You've definitely got unemployment rates right now that are truly at historic lows. And while certainly what is happening with interest rates would be expected over time to influence that. We are a far cry from the 9.5% that we were in the great recession.  And similarly, when you think about pent-up savings and the desire for people to take and do travel to not assume that they can put it off that they really don't want to postpone it and that there is still both business and leisure trips that families and consumers want to make. And while consumer health is something that we will be watching extremely closely, for the moment, there does look to be some extra room there that could help as we go into a potential recession. The only part that I would add is that for the owners who did do some renovations during COVID, I think the results that they're seeing are powerful. And I think our good incentive for other owners to do the same. We did -- as Tony mentioned, we did give owners a bit of a pass in the heart of COVID to help everybody manage through the pandemic. But I think as we are coming out of it, I think the entire industry recognizes the importance of having both product and service up to where our consumers, our guests expect them to be given the prices that people are paying.  So we do expect there to be additional renovations and frankly, probably a pickup in renovations now that we're largely through that impact and believe that the returns on those renovations will be strong. For the time being, we certainly continue to see that our -- we expect our deletion rate to stay in this 1% to 1.5% rate that we've talked about for several years. We will, as we get into the new year, refine that a bit as we go through the entire budget process. But I think that sort of range should be your expectation. Sure. So let's talk -- I'm going to reference back to Tony's comments about where roughly 60% of our BT in Q3 was from small- and medium-sized companies. And that, frankly, is sprinkled all over the country. So that's going to be everywhere from New York to Tulsa to smaller markets that are -- at limited-service hotels rather than -- the larger special corporate accounts obviously are more headquartered in the urban large cities.  The thing I will say is we've continued to see progress as we move too along. When you think of, for example, you think of New York City, which has moved quite nicely during the year, with the improvement in BT, where they were down 29% in Q1. Today New York City was actually 3% higher in Q3 than 2019. So I think you will continue to see the progress, the trends in BT are similar, both internationally as well as in the U.S. I do think as we move into 2023, a lot of this world depend on the state of the economy. So kind of having a prediction about exactly where BT will go, it is tough to pinpoint.  We do look for continued improvement and think it will ultimately get back to where it was, but the exact timing of that hard to say. And then the last thing I'll point out is just the reality that we have seen it moderate in terms of its rate of improvement as we've moved into Q3, and I would expect to see that moderation continue. Thank you."

It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Jackie Burka. Please go ahead.\nJackie Burka: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Marriott\u2019s second quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Business Operations; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. I will remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws.

Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. Please also note that, unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy and ADR comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and include hotels temporarily closed due to COVID-19. RevPAR occupancy and ADR comparisons between 2022 and 2019 reflects properties that are defined as comparable as of June 30, 2022 even if they were not open and operating for the full year 2019 or they did not meet all the other criteria for comparable in 2019. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons to pre-pandemic or 2019 are comparing the same time period in each year. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thank you, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of Asia-Pacific had more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, leading to June global RevPAR 1% above 2019. Worldwide occupancy for the month rose to 71%, just 5 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels, with global ADR an impressive 8% over the same month in 2019. Demand across all customer segments improved during the quarter. Record leisure demand strengthened further with second quarter global leisure transient room nights 14% above the 2019 second quarter. Group demand experienced the greatest acceleration. In the U.S. and Canada, group RevPAR had nearly fully recovered in June, down just 1% to 2019 compared to down 17% in March. Group revenue pace for the back half of the year has also continued to improve. June in the year, for the year, new bookings were up 50% compared to those bookings in June of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group RevPAR for the remainder of 2022 was pacing just a few percentage points down to 2019. We expect additional short-term bookings will further bolster group revenues, which could lead to second half group RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada being even to even up slightly compared to 2019. Our sales team remains focused on driving group average rate, which has been steadily rising for new bookings. At our hotels in the U.S. and Canada, ADR for in the year, for the year group bookings made in January, was just above 2019 levels. But by June, the rate had risen to up 16%. Business transient demand also strengthened, albeit at a more moderate pace as workers returned to the office in greater numbers. In the U.S. June business transient room nights were 9% below the same month in 2019 versus down about 20% in the first quarter. Day of the week trends in the U.S. and Canada suggest that travelers are continuing to combine leisure and business trips. While occupancy midweek has continued to recover, in June, Monday through Wednesday occupancy was still around 10 percentage points below 2019. Occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was fully recovered and occupancy on Thursdays and Sundays, typically known as shoulder nights, was close to 2019 levels. With nearly all major countries around the world having opened their borders, rising cross-border travel was another key driver of the solid recovery during the quarter. However, cross-border travel is still not fully back to pre-pandemic levels. So, there is still additional upside, especially from Greater China, where stringent travel restrictions remain in place. While we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. On the contrary, the pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment and the lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders in most markets around the world are fueling travel. And as Leeny will discuss, we expect to see continued RevPAR recovery through the end of the year. As travelers get back on the road in increasing numbers, our 169 million Bonvoy members are more actively engaging with our powerful loyalty platform. Monthly active users of our app, digital visits and direct digital bookings, which help drive the owner and franchisee profitability, all reached new highs in June. Additionally, more members are earning and using points outside of a hotel stay as a result of our focus on enhancing the platform through numerous collaborations. The number of Bonvoy co-brand credit card holders is climbing globally, with card acquisitions and total card spend both hitting record levels in the second quarter. Remarkably, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from the end of 2019 through the end of the second quarter this year. In July, we introduced a new credit card in China and the initial response has been tremendous. Turning to the development front. The pace of deal activity continues to pick up. In the second quarter, we signed another 135 deals, a second quarter record following a record first quarter. Additionally, despite supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and rising interest rates, the number of deals falling out of the pipeline remains below historical levels. Interest in conversions remains particularly strong given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales as owners continue to seek out the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott portfolio. Conversions represented 30% of room signings in the quarter. One win to highlight is a recent landmark agreement for 8 hotels in Vietnam with Vinpearl, a new owner to our system. The deal includes 6 conversion hotels that are expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. Conversions also represented 25% of the roughly 17,000 rooms added to our system in the quarter. While construction timelines have lengthened a bit this year in most markets due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we still expect the number of room additions to ramp in the second half of the year. For the full year, gross additions are still anticipated to approach 5%. Given our announcement several weeks ago that we are suspending all operations in Russia, we now expect a 1.5% to 2% deletion rate for 2022. While our expectation for deletions outside of Russia remains at 1% to 1.5%, the deletion of 6,500 rooms in the country represents almost 0.5 percentage point. Now as a reminder, fees from Russia represented well under 0.5% of global fees in 2019. We have not been recognizing fees from Russia for many months now and the financial impact of these rooms leaving is de minimis. So, our net rooms growth for 2022 could now be 3% to 3.5% or 3.5% to 4% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid single-digit net rooms growth rate. The timing will largely depend on when new construction starts, which have trailed well below 2019 levels for the last 2 years really begin to accelerate, particularly here in the U.S. Construction timelines in the U.S. are currently just over 2 years for a limited service hotel and longer for full-service properties. Looking ahead with the largest footprint in the industry, strong builder affinity for our brands and the improving global travel environment, I am bullish about the company\u2019s future growth prospects for development and for the company overall. I want to take a moment and thank all of our associates around the world. Their commitment to taking care of our guests has helped produce our outstanding results and I am so very proud of their dedication and resilience. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global RevPAR was down only 3% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Looking at the regions, in the U.S. and Canada, RevPAR came in ahead of our expectations largely due to stronger than anticipated growth in ADR and group demand. Compared to 2019, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was up 1% in the quarter and up 3% in June. ADR has improved each month this year, reaching 9% above pre-pandemic levels in June. Occupancy further strengthened from the first to the second quarter on both an absolute basis and versus pre-pandemic levels. June occupancy of 76% was within 4 percentage points of the same month in 2019. In June, U.S. and Canada RevPAR more than fully recovered across all market types, primary, secondary and tertiary, for the first time since the pandemic began. It has been very encouraging to see demand come back so powerfully in major cities like New York, where RevPAR increased 7% versus June 2019. With orders opened in Europe, the room nights from international guests more than doubled in the region from the first quarter to the second. With this strong return of international travel, Europe has experienced the swiftest RevPAR recovery of all of our regions this year. RevPAR in Europe topped 2019 levels in June a remarkable 57 percentage point increase from January. Cross-border travel also helped drive strong second quarter results in the Middle East and Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America area. Second quarter RevPAR rose 16% in EMEA and 13% in CALA compared to 2019. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, saw rapid RevPAR improvement during the second quarter as the region is now mostly open with India and Australia more than fully recovered. Second quarter RevPAR was down 22% compared to 2019 given the lack of travelers from Greater China and the fact that rigorous travel restrictions remain in place in Japan, one of our largest markets in the region. Greater China continues to lag the recovery of other regions due to its strict zero COVID policy. RevPAR during the quarter declined more than 50% compared to 2019 as a result of the lockdowns in many cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter driven by higher RevPAR rooms growth and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Those fees totaled $204 million in the second quarter driven largely by growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose a remarkable 38% year-over-year. Incentive management fees, or IMF, increased meaningfully in the quarter, reaching $135 million. Over half of our IMFs came from U.S. and Canada, where we earned more IMFs than we did in the second quarter of 2019. At the hotel level working closely with our owners and franchisees to contain operating costs while delivering superior customer service remains a key area of focus. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels were 3 percentage points higher than 2019 levels in the second quarter despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. We are keeping an eye on wages and benefits as industry staffing challenges persist in certain markets. Yet we remain optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. G&A and other expenses totaled $231 million in the second quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals as well as increased travel expense. With COVID now essentially endemic, global borders overwhelmingly open and business somewhat more predictable, we are providing guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The full details are in our press release. There is still a higher than usual degree of uncertainty in our outlook, especially as it relates to Greater China, but we are encouraged by the positive momentum in demand across customer segments and robust ADRs in the vast majority of markets around the world. We expect the global RevPAR recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and ADR compared to 2019 in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. On a worldwide basis compared to 2019, we could see RevPAR flat to up 3% in the third quarter and down 6% to down 3% for the full year. Compared to 2021, global RevPAR in the third quarter could be up in the mid-30% range, and for the full year, it could be up around 50%. For the full year, we are now anticipating G&A expenses of $890 million to $900 million due to higher compensation accruals as well as travel expenses, but still well below [Technical Difficulty]. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, above our prior full year peak in 2019. We now expect full year investment spending of $600 million to $650 million. Our guidance now includes roughly $200 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. Loyalty is still expected to be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was in the low-end of our targeted range of 3x to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter and have already bought 448 million of stock as of July 29 in addition to paying our dividend in the second quarter at $0.30 per share. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will make investments that enhance our growth and increase shareholder value, while returning any excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to our investment grade rating. Given our outlook for further global recovery and our powerful business model that is generating significant cash beyond our investment needs, we expect to return more than $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This level of capital returns is included in the guidance we have provided today. Looking ahead, I am very optimistic about our future. Marriott is incredibly well positioned given the breadth and depth of our unparalleled global portfolio, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, and the best team in the business. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nShaun Kelley: I wanted to start off pretty much where you left off, Leeny, on the capital return program. I feel like once every 10 years or so, we get this quarter where everything kind of comes together on that. And obviously, it\u2019s a major increase from where we found ourselves at just a quarter ago. Could you talk about the levers there? And then sort of where does this take you as it would relate to your longer term goals around your leverage range? Does this keep you solidly in the middle of that? Do you \u2013 or where would it put you relative to that kind of at the end of the year and maybe give us a little teaser for what this could mean for 2023 as well?\nLeeny Oberg: Sean, I think you said it best in your question that it really is back to where we were in terms of the way the model fundamentally works. As I said in my statement, we are at the low-end of the 3x to 3.5x adjusted debt to EBITDAR at the end of Q2 and we have given you a model that keeps us squarely and comfortably in that range. And we obviously want to keep our flexibility both in terms of investment opportunities as well as taking advantage of excess available cash. So, I think you will continue to see us move forward with the exact same approach that we have taken for some time.\nShaun Kelley: Great. And maybe just as a very quick follow-up, Tony, you have a lot of great color just kind of walking us through group, leisure and a little bit on the business transient side, particularly the day of the week\u2019s commentary. Could you just talk specifically around leisure, there is a lot of fear out there around the ability to lap some of the incredible rate gains that have occurred? So just what are you seeing maybe across some of the resort properties or areas where you know that the recovery happened a little faster and consumer demand patterns have changed? Any signs of weakness or softness that would concern you at all at this stage?\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Sean. The short answer is not really. The already robust leisure demand that we have seen in the last couple of quarters, continue to improve. Leisure room nights were up 14% to 2019 in the quarter and they were only up 11% in the first quarter. So, we continue to see acceleration and we continue to see more and more of this blended trip purpose. In my remarks, I talked a little bit about day-of-the-week patterns. And so I think that\u2019s quite encouraging to us as well. And then, finally, we have not talked a lot about international cross-border travel. While we are seeing improvement, we are not back to where we were pre-pandemic and we think that represents some upside on the leisure segment as well. And then the last thing I would say is all of those are comments about demand levels. We continue to see really encouraging pricing power on the leisure side as well. It\u2019s a little early to talk about the winter holidays. But as we look at Labor Day, for instance, we continue to see double-digit increases in ADR relative to where we were pre-pandemic.\nShaun Kelley: Very helpful. Thank you, both.\nTony Capuano: Thank you, Shaun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Hi, good morning, everybody.\nTony Capuano: Hi, Joe.\nLeeny Oberg: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Tony, I was hoping maybe you could give us a sense of corporate rate negotiations for 2023 corporate rates. I know the last couple of years, they have been sort of non-events because corporate demand has been relatively low. How are you thinking of corporate pricing? And maybe how are those negotiations different now versus what they have been in the past?\nTony Capuano: Of course. So as you know, for business transient, we rolled over special corporate rates since the beginning of the pandemic. We\u2019re just now starting the negotiation process for 2023. And so again, it\u2019s early, but we can certainly imagine those rates being up high single digits year-over-year in 2023.\nJoe Greff: Great. And then, Tony, just switching topics, you mentioned about net rooms growth accelerating, and this is before the impact of Russia, which I\u2019m looking at it as sort of a one-time thing. But when you look at 2023, 2024, 2025 net rooms growth and during some periods seeing it accelerate from where you are now, does that require more meaningful financial assistance for Marriott to third-party hotel owners or is that just a function of kind of getting through sort of a longer construction time table?\nTony Capuano: I think, much more the latter. Now I was quite thrilled with our conversion volume both on signings and openings in the second quarter. It is a competitive market for conversions. I\u2019m quite pleased that we had more conversion openings than any of our peers in the quarter, and we will continue to try to do smart conversions, which means we will use the same capital discipline you\u2019ve come to know us for even pre pandemic. I think to really see acceleration, and this is an industry comment as much as a Marriott comment, particularly in the U.S., you have seen a slowing in construction starts. Just over the last quarter, we have seen that start to tick up, although not to levels we saw in 2019. But I think we will do our best to continue to drive conversion volume and do everything we can to get shovels in the ground. You may know that I had the privilege to spend a little time with the administration last week, and one of the things that we spoke to the administration about was seeking assistance to resolve some of the supply chain issues that continue to slow some of the construction starts.\nLeeny Oberg: And Joe, just one follow-on, we talked about two record quarters of signings so far this year. And to your specific question, they did not involve a greater-than-usual element of capital from Marriott for those signings?\nTony Capuano: And then maybe just to put a fine point on your question, Joe, our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single-digit net unit growth, there is a couple of things in the release. The fact that we had quarter-over-quarter growth in the pipeline, the fact that we continue to have more than 200,000 rooms globally under construction and that we continue to see accelerated volume in both signings and openings on the conversion front combined to strengthen that confidence.\nJoe Greff: Excellent color. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi, good morning, everyone. Question for you on the back half guidance or implied back half guidance. Would you say that is higher, same \u2013 higher or the same than your internal assumptions as of last May, last earnings?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, it is. There is no doubt that the recovery has accelerated faster than we had originally anticipated. And I think it\u2019s both in rate and occ in varying parts of the world. I think the cross-border has been obviously incredibly encouraging to see that topped Europe as an example, meaningfully faster than expected. But yes, I think it is stronger than our expectations both a quarter ago. And then frankly, a quarter ago was better than we expected a quarter before that.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, great. Then a follow-up question, this goes back to the lingering one about what percentage of business travel may be permanently gone. And in my data research, for the higher-end customer, it looks like down 20% to 25%. But my question with that is how much do you think that higher-end customer has shifted to Thursday and Sunday nights. And how much has the smaller and medium-sized businesses offset that perhaps loss from the higher corporate customer?\nTony Capuano: Well, there is no question that the rapid improvement in occupancies in the shoulder days has been maybe a bit of a surprising but encouraging development. When we think about business transient demand, the small and medium-sized businesses, they are back. They are back above 2019 levels of volume. As you point out, the bigger corporate customers, they are not quite back yet. But even there, we continue to see steady improvement, albeit not necessarily as rapid as we might like.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: Thank you, Patrick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. Two questions. One is on group for 2023. Are you starting to see that? I think a quarter ago it may have been down 10% or 15% below group in 2019 at the time for 2020. Just wondering if you\u2019re starting to see the group sort of stepping up a little bit more because it seems intuitive at some point that, that could actually be higher than \u201819. But wondering how that is shaping up right now?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So maybe I can give you a couple of statistics, and Leeny may provide some color as well. When we look at bookings for \u201823 during 2022, we are down about 2% in revenue versus where we would have been for the bookings in 2019. But interestingly, ADR is up 16%. So we continue to see that strong pricing power. And we\u2019re even more optimistic, Robin, as you heard in our prepared remarks, because of the shorter booking window in group, even through the back half of this year and most certainly into \u201823, we expect those numbers to continue to improve as we see more and more short-term bookings.\nLeeny Oberg: So Robin, I\u2019ll add a couple of comments. I think the major theme we\u2019ve got is in the quarter, for the quarter, in the year, for the year. In June, the benefit of that really got us to where group RevPAR was only down 1% in the month. So when we look at the rest of this year, from what\u2019s on the books currently, we are seeing low single digits for the rest of the year in terms of group revenue, while next year, we\u2019re still kind of in the 15% down, but I think you need to continue to think about this booking pattern, which is much closer to the actual event that has been filling in really nicely. So it\u2019s not that different for \u201823 versus a quarter ago except from what we\u2019re seeing in the quarter for the quarter, and even in the back half of \u201822, we\u2019re seeing some really great fill-in business that has got us pretty close to \u201819 levels where we could end up actually exceeding \u201819 levels in the back half of this year.\nRobin Farley: And that\u2019s exceeding in terms of rate, not necessarily group room nights but just in terms of total group revenues?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, that\u2019s total \u2013 that is definitely total group revenue. Again, it\u2019s obviously where we are seeing it fill in. It\u2019s not just rate. It\u2019s also occ as we fill in the business. But you\u2019re right, the rate on group has been performing incredibly well.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great, thank you. And then just the other question was in terms of conversions, which seems to be doing really nicely, is this \u2013 I guess, how long do you think will the sort of the tail of conversions that are a result of the pandemic and the downturn? From what you\u2019ve seen historically, when there are downturns, kind of how much after? In other words, is it sort of a year of higher conversions, a year out or 2 years of higher? I guess, how should we think about what trajectory the conversion demand may follow. Thanks.\nTony Capuano: I continue to be quite bullish, Robin, on the trajectory of conversions for a few reasons. Number one, unlike some conventional downturns we\u2019ve experienced in the past, where early in the downturn, you saw a lot of distress, the impact to our business was so severe that you saw the lenders being much more creative than accommodating with owners. So you didn\u2019t necessarily see a flood of distressed assets changing hands in the market. As demand and performance have recovered, there is the potential that there may be more assets in play, number one. Number two, the portfolio of conversion-friendly brands we have, particularly our soft brands, Tribute, Autograph and Luxury Collection is more robust than we\u2019ve ever armed our transactors in any other recessionary environment. And I combine those two factors, and it drives my bullishness about that trajectory.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you sort of conceptually, as the recovery kind of continues, which so far has been driven by such strong rate, which we\u2019ve seen have great kind of flow-through to owners with lower occupancies, but as the world sort of continues to normalize, hopefully, next year, would you expect to see occupancies get back to pre-pandemic levels and potentially maybe a significant slowdown in rate in order to get there? Or do you think it\u2019s just sort of a structural change where owners are like we\u2019re going to charge higher rate, even if it means sacrificing occupancy to kind of simplify it?\nTony Capuano: Well, as Leeny mentioned in response to an earlier question, we do believe the recovery will continue to be driven by both occupancy and rate. You also heard her refer a bit to some of the murkiness beyond the end of the year. But we do expect both occupancy and rate continue to improve through the end of \u201822. And we continue to be pleased with the pace of rate recovery through the first half of this year.\nLeeny Oberg: So one other comment, Smedes and that is that \u2013 to remember that we\u2019re comparing to \u201819. So that on inflation adjusted numbers, rate has not kept up with kind of real rates. So in that regard, I think while it\u2019s fabulous and we\u2019re thrilled to see the consumers love travel and don\u2019t want to put it off, the reality is that there is inflation and that we are pricing these rooms on a very frequent basis and that, on a real rate basis, they are not back to 2019 levels.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to\u2026\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nDavid Katz: Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little deeper on for corporate travel. If you could color us in just a little bit, there is so much data and useful out there about certain cities versus others, urban versus non-urban corporate. Is there anything that you can share that you are picking up in your flow with respect to urban versus not in those various segments?\nTony Capuano: Well, what I can tell you, some of this may be a little more anecdotal, but the early days of the recovery were clearly dominated by leisure destinations, trailed significantly by what we saw in the urban core. In many of the major urban markets across the country and across the world, we continue to see a reasonably steady and encouraging improvement in terms of both occupancy and rate. And we hear anecdotally from our corporate clients. We\u2019re seeing more and more return to the office, which is driving business demand. And when we look at some of the big major markets that I think are decent indicators for us, you look at New York, for instance, that had an 86% occupancy in the quarter. You look at San Francisco, 78%; Washington, D.C., 76%; Los Angeles, 80%. You are seeing steady volumes of demand recovering in many of those markets that were trailing the leisure destinations.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And just as a quick follow-up. Leeny, in your comments you made, I think, kind of a passing comment about labor. And if you could go just a little bit farther as to whether you are still seeing wages continue to increase, whether they are flat or taking some other direction and, within that, the international element within the United States and the degree to which that labor force is starting to return or whether it hasn\u2019t yet and what those outcomes might be would be helpful.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. Yes. We are seeing \u2013 continuing to see hourly wages go up. And when I look at it compared to \u201819, the reality is, overall, and this comment is actually regarding U.S. and Canada, that it has kept up with inflation, if not just a teeny bit higher than that. It has slowed. The pace of increase has slowed. And one of the things that I think is interesting is to look at the positions that we\u2019re trying to fill if, for example, normal staffing levels were that we were trying to fill the final 95% to 100% of the positions we needed at the hotel level. Right now, we\u2019re at 93%. So it\u2019s definitely improved. It is not back to where we were in \u201819 in terms of the labor shortage, but we\u2019re definitely seeing steady improvement, and the wage increases have slowed. Outside the U.S., it\u2019s much more varied. It really depends on the particular market. And I would say Europe probably has seen some more similarities to the U.S., while in Asia Pacific, for example, there is really been far less of the kind of pressures that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.\nDavid Katz: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandt Montour from Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: Hello. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious if you could unpack leisure demand a little bit more, and maybe let us know if you are seeing greater dispersion and pricing elasticities between your luxury end and your more middle brands.\nLeeny Oberg: So a couple of things. One of the easiest ways to think about luxury is that rate has continued to stay very strong. But what we\u2019ve also seen is that the markets that were previously weaker, like a New York or San Francisco, the luxury hotels in those markets are now filling in. They, on average, are not necessarily quite as high as in some of the resort markets. So it actually makes it look, on a blended basis, like the gains in ADR and luxury are not as strong, while the reality is just the opposite, that they continue to be quite strong. I think one of the most encouraging things to see is that the overall luxury portfolio is continuing to gain in both occ and rate. And then as Tony was talking about earlier, I think it\u2019s also particularly encouraging to see the premium market, the Marriotts, the Sheratons, the Renaissances in kind of all markets really recovering now more in the second quarter meaningfully than they were in the first quarter. So we really don\u2019t expect that we are depending on continued additional ADR gains in luxury through the rest of this year, but we do continue to see really strong demand. So I think it is tide-floats-all-boats view of what we\u2019re seeing, which is demand across all segments continuing to strengthen.\nTony Capuano: And I think just to give some context to that, we still saw in the second quarter in the U.S. and Canada, luxury rate up 23% in the quarter versus \u201819. So lots of questions around how much runway we have for luxury but another really solid quarter in terms of the luxury pricing.\nBrandt Montour: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up on business travel, when you think about your large portfolio of corporate accounts, I was just curious if you could give us a sense of how much of your demand mix is earlier stage companies within technology, biotechnology and other slices of the corporate world that could potentially be reining in expenses faster than average?\nTony Capuano: Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll try. SMEs represent now about 60% to 65% of our business transient demand, which is a bit higher than what we experienced pre pandemic. The bigger corporate clients continue to steadily improve. And over time, we expect to get maybe not all the way back but closer to where we were in terms of the mix of SMEs versus large corporate clients. But right now, it\u2019s in the 60% to 65% range that is the category I think you\u2019re talking about.\nBrandt Montour: Okay. Thanks so much Tony. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario from Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning everyone. First, just a quick modeling question, I think you have given the sensitivity of $25 million to $30 million of fee revenue for 1 point change in RevPAR. What is that updated range? And then how might that ratio change looking out to 2023 in a more normalized growth environment?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. Sure. Comparing to \u201821, it\u2019s $25 million to $30 million per point of RevPAR in \u201822 versus \u201821. We are not in a position yet to talk about \u201823, all of that budgeting work. But I would expect it to continue to be somewhat similar. It varies, as you know, depending on what part of the world the improvements happen. It\u2019s obviously more per point of RevPAR compared to \u201819. You get into the weeds on differences in comp sets, etcetera. But it is probably closer to $40 million per point if you are comparing a point of RevPAR in \u201822 to a point of RevPAR in \u201819.\nMichael Bellisario: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on group, can you maybe provide some details on what group planners are asking for differently today and then maybe how booking patterns are either the same or different today versus pre-pandemic?\nTony Capuano: Sure. Again, this will maybe be a bit anecdotal. We just held an event called The Exchange, which was where we hosted about 500 corporate and association meeting planners. In general sessions and in some smaller executive forums, we had a chance to talk to them and essentially ask the question you just asked. And I would say the two themes I heard most notably. Number one, they gave us high marks for our flexibility on issues like attrition during the pandemic. And I think they are hopeful we would continue to show that level of flexibility into perpetuity, which, as demand improves, we are tightening up a bit. And they understand that intellectually. They are just wishing for the good old days where they had maximum flexibility. The other theme we heard loud and clear is an increasing focus on the company\u2019s efforts around all things ESG and an increasing number of our \u2013 both corporate and association booking contracts. They are asking for not only our publicly stated goals, but for reports on our progress against those goals.\nLeeny Oberg: And just one other interesting stat that I think is helpful is that length of stay for \u2013 up almost 25% compared to 2019, as is the average size for new bookings. So, again, I think this all continues to emphasize that associations, companies, organizations are wanting to get their people together.\nTony Capuano: And then one fine point that I forgot about from some of the conversations at The Exchange, they asked us from a technology perspective to do everything we can to make it easier for them to tack on a couple of leisure days to their reservation pre or post meeting, which was just another confirmation that this idea of blended trip purpose will likely endure well beyond the end of the pandemic.\nMichael Bellisario: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just the first one on China. To what extent is China a normal environment now for signings, but not a normal environment for construction? So, how much of that is the bridge back to your mid-single digit unit growth you are expecting to get back to?\nTony Capuano: So, there is a couple of questions embedded there. I think our deal volume and our openings are off peak, but they are steadily recovering. The vast majority of our operating hotels and the vast majority of the projects in our pipeline are domestically owned. And so those domestic entities continue to benefit from the Central Government encouraging domestic travel across China. And many of those hotels are benefiting from increased volumes of domestic travel, albeit some pauses when certain markets go into lockdown. And so our expectation is a steady improvement, but we have not embedded in our guidance any sort of wholesale lifting of zero COVID policy that we have seen over the last couple of quarters.\nRichard Clarke: Excellent guys. Thanks so much. Maybe just a quick follow-up, if I may. I noticed your kind of capital returns guidance says that depends on whether you do any disposals this year. I mean is that likely, are you looking at the owned portfolio again? Are there any potential disposals to come?\nLeeny Oberg: We are always looking, but the numbers that I gave do not assume any additional asset sales this year.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks. Really encouraging to see margins ahead, IMFs ahead. It sounds like cost reduction efforts are certainly helping to offset the labor wage pressure. But as you dig into that, I would be curious how you are thinking about the customer experience from the average Bonvoy guest. I know there has been some surveys out which can be lagging, talking about how the consumer feels about scaled-back breakfast offerings, changes in housekeeping. So, as you look at things more recently, how do you think the guest is feeling today versus summer of 2019?\nTony Capuano: I would say it\u2019s very much a work in progress, but we are really encouraged by the metrics that we monitor through guest satisfaction surveys and particularly the intent-to-return numbers. We are not quite back to where we were pre-pandemic, but we have made meaningful and steady progress on those metrics. As you may recall from some prior earnings calls, in the depths of the pandemic, we suspended some of those quality metrics. Those are all back in place now, brand, standard, audits, guest surveys. And the teams \u2013 we just went through our quarterly business reviews. All of our teams around the world are keenly focused on driving intent to return. And we are pretty encouraged. And I think it\u2019s reflected in the manner in which our most loyal Bonvoy customers continue to engage. Our top tier within Bonvoy, the ambassador tier, has remained very active. 96% of our ambassadors had at least one stay or points transaction in \u201821, they averaged about 100 nights, and we see those metrics improving as well. We have rolled out our new housekeeping protocols, and the early returns from our guests is they like the certainty that, that offers.\nVince Ciepiel: Thanks for all that color. And then, separately, on distribution, encouraging to see loyalty contribution exceed \u201819 levels, digital bookings hitting all-time high. Curious how you are thinking about kind of the next 12 months, that ideal distribution mix between corporate, group and leisure as some of those buckets are starting to recover more fully. I mean consider ADR differentials between those three and then maybe day of week occupancy needs, how are you planning the business over the next 12 months? And maybe within that, how are you thinking about OTA as a percentage of the mix going forward?\nTony Capuano: So, maybe I will go in reverse order, pre-pandemic, looking at a year like \u201819, we have seen steady reduction in the percentage of total room nights that came out of the OTAs. During the first 2 years with pandemic, as you might expect, we saw OTA volume rise, but direct bookings rose more rapidly. And I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect in the coming quarters that we would start to get back to the trend line we saw pre-pandemic of the total volume of OTA contribution moderating. I think your first question was really more around mix by segment. Back in \u201819 in round numbers, about 40% of our business was leisure. 37% was business transient. 20% was group and 4% was contract. In the second quarter, business transient had risen to about 32%. Leisure transient was 43%. Group was 21%, and contract was pretty steady at 4%. But remember, the Leisure segment was already our most rapidly growing segment even in 2019 before the pandemic did. And we continue to see \u2013 expect to see leisure to grow rapidly. And as I have said in some previous calls, this blending of trip purpose may make it that much tougher for us to tell you with absolute precision what that mix looks like.\nLeeny Oberg: And I think to your question about revenue management strategy, as we think about going forward, it has been very encouraging to see the strength of group and the strength of group rate. So, as we think about all the possible outcomes for the economy over the next couple of years, that strength in group is quite encouraging. And then obviously, on the transient side, the booking window there is about three weeks. So, that tends to \u2013 which is, frankly, back to about where it was in \u201819, and that will vary with customers\u2019 needs and wants as we see things unfold.\nVince Ciepiel: Thanks for all that detail. All make sense.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Crow \u2013 sorry, Dori Kesten from Wells Fargo.\nDori Kesten: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning Dori.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning Dori.\nDori Kesten: Okay. Can you provide more details on cross-border travel regionally, who is leading and lagging outside of Asia Pacific as compared to \u201819? And then just any changes you have noted in spend?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So, let\u2019s talk super high level at first, which is that if pre-pandemic, we were in the, call it, 18% to 19% sort of cross-border travel around the world that, that number fell and was down in the \u2013 a little bit north of 10% and then has clearly moved back up several hundred basis points, particularly as we got into Q2. But we are not back to the same level of cross-border travel. Obviously, particularly with Asia Pacific and Greater China still being very much domestic travel based. The thing I did find interesting in Q2 in the U.S. was that we were pretty close to being back to the number of international \u2013 the percentage of international nights. We were pre-pandemic at 5%. And in Q2, we were at 4% coming from cross-border travel. I think the biggest shift that you saw was obviously partly a function of opening kind of more comfort travel and then the strong dollar. And that had a massive impact on Europe in the summer, and you saw a very large influx of U.S. travelers coming into Europe, which helped their RevPAR tremendously.\nTony Capuano: And I might just add on that, Dori, it was just towards the tail end of the quarter where you saw the U.S. government rolled back the inbound international testing requirement, and we think that\u2019s going to be another accelerant for cross-border travel. In fact, right after that policy change was announced, the USTA came out and estimated that they thought that would drive 5.4 million incremental visitors to the U.S. in the back half of the year with about $9 billion of spend.\nDori Kesten: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Hi. Good morning everybody. You talked about the murkiness beyond the end of the year, but I am just curious, how much visibility do you actually have on the Labor Day?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, again, as we talked about before, you have got the short booking window on transient, but you have also got holiday bookings when you look at December, when you look at Thanksgiving, Columbus Day as well as Labor Day. And I think across all of those, we continue to be reminded that people are not willing to give up travel and that you are seeing it in the strong rate and strong early bookings for those periods. And they are obviously overwhelmingly leisure bookings and group also continuing to fill in very nicely. So, I think we \u2013 when we look at what\u2019s on the books, as we move into either even September and October, while you are right that the percentage that is on the books is still relatively low on the transient side. The pace of those bookings is very encouraging.\nBill Crow: Maybe if I could follow-up on that, on the holiday bookings, it\u2019s interesting, Wyndham talked about Florida RevPAR being down double digit compared to 2021 in July. And I am curious if we were to look at it on a 1-year basis instead of going back to 2019, what your thoughts are at holiday bookings?\nLeeny Oberg: I would have to \u2013 I can get Jackie and Betsy to get back to you on the specifics for December \u201822 versus December \u201821. I think again, the overall comment that I will make is that we continue to see really strong bookings for the end of the year. One of the things that I talked about in luxury is the reality that as you see some of the other luxury markets start to fill in that aren\u2019t necessarily as high ADR as some of the resorts that starts to muddy the waters a little bit, but that\u2019s a good issue. Remember that right now, the percentage that is on our books for that period is probably under 5%. So, it\u2019s really quite small and making big sweeping statements with that small amount on the books probably doesn\u2019t make sense. But when we think about the pace for the holiday periods, we continue to be really encouraged.\nBill Crow: That\u2019s perfect. If I could just ask one quick question on the development signings, any change in the composition of the signings, say, from full service to select service given construction costs and financing environment?\nTony Capuano: On the signings side, we have seen a bit of a slowing in select service here in the U.S., but some of that may be because of the high volume of conversions are disproportionately full service. What I can tell you is in terms of monthly approval volumes coming out of our development committees, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected, which is our large multi-unit long-term developers and owners of select-service hotels gearing their development organizations back up, and that\u2019s driving the sort of approval volume we have seen through the first half of the year.\nBill Crow: Perfect. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. And most have been asked. But just on group recovery, can you contrast the type of group events that happened in a month like June with group events that happened in a month like September? In a sense, business was competing with leisure this summer. And I think you threw out the June down two on group relative to \u201819. Would you expect that down two to kind of maintain, or would you expect that gap to hold or narrow as we get to a more business-dependent period like September? Thanks for taking my question.\nLeeny Oberg: So, I will just give you one comment. I think the shift won\u2019t be a massive shift. I think there is still going to be a lot of social group events going into the fall as well. When we look at what\u2019s on the books, it was only down 1% right now from Q3. And here we are barely into Q3. So, I think we \u2013 as we said before, we have got the possibility that actually group ends up higher than 2019 relative to Q2 when it was still down a little bit. So, we are seeing great demand on the part of corporate customers for getting their people together. And I think you are going to continue to see the social events as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily a huge swing based on your comment that it is more a business-oriented quarter. The only other thing I will point out is that August is typically a seasonally cleaver [ph] months for us in group just because of the realities of family vacations and people not being in school. So, I think August, you should expect what we have always seen, which is a relatively seasonally more light period on the group side.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks very much.\nOperator: And that is all the questions we have. I will now turn the conference back over to our speakers.\nTony Capuano: Well, thank you all for joining us. It\u2019s a compelling and exciting story about the resiliency of travel and the resilience of Marriott\u2019s business model. We look forward to seeing you all on the road soon, and thanks again for your interest.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which were driven by robust demand for our brands around the world. By the last month of the quarter, RevPAR in all regions outside of Asia-Pacific had more than fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, leading to June global RevPAR 1% above 2019. Worldwide occupancy for the month rose to 71%, just 5 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels, with global ADR an impressive 8% over the same month in 2019. Demand across all customer segments improved during the quarter. Record leisure demand strengthened further with second quarter global leisure transient room nights 14% above the 2019 second quarter. Group demand experienced the greatest acceleration. In the U.S. and Canada, group RevPAR had nearly fully recovered in June, down just 1% to 2019 compared to down 17% in March. Group revenue pace for the back half of the year has also continued to improve. June in the year, for the year, new bookings were up 50% compared to those bookings in June of 2019. At the end of the second quarter, group RevPAR for the remainder of 2022 was pacing just a few percentage points down to 2019. We expect additional short-term bookings will further bolster group revenues, which could lead to second half group RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada being even to even up slightly compared to 2019. Our sales team remains focused on driving group average rate, which has been steadily rising for new bookings. At our hotels in the U.S. and Canada, ADR for in the year, for the year group bookings made in January, was just above 2019 levels. But by June, the rate had risen to up 16%. Business transient demand also strengthened, albeit at a more moderate pace as workers returned to the office in greater numbers. In the U.S. June business transient room nights were 9% below the same month in 2019 versus down about 20% in the first quarter. Day of the week trends in the U.S. and Canada suggest that travelers are continuing to combine leisure and business trips. While occupancy midweek has continued to recover, in June, Monday through Wednesday occupancy was still around 10 percentage points below 2019. Occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was fully recovered and occupancy on Thursdays and Sundays, typically known as shoulder nights, was close to 2019 levels. With nearly all major countries around the world having opened their borders, rising cross-border travel was another key driver of the solid recovery during the quarter. However, cross-border travel is still not fully back to pre-pandemic levels. So, there is still additional upside, especially from Greater China, where stringent travel restrictions remain in place. While we are closely monitoring consumer and macroeconomic trends, we have yet to see signs of a slowdown in global lodging demand. On the contrary, the pent-up demand for all types of travel, the shift of spending towards experiences versus goods, sustained high levels of employment and the lifting of travel restrictions and opening borders in most markets around the world are fueling travel. And as Leeny will discuss, we expect to see continued RevPAR recovery through the end of the year. As travelers get back on the road in increasing numbers, our 169 million Bonvoy members are more actively engaging with our powerful loyalty platform. Monthly active users of our app, digital visits and direct digital bookings, which help drive the owner and franchisee profitability, all reached new highs in June. Additionally, more members are earning and using points outside of a hotel stay as a result of our focus on enhancing the platform through numerous collaborations. The number of Bonvoy co-brand credit card holders is climbing globally, with card acquisitions and total card spend both hitting record levels in the second quarter. Remarkably, the number of global card accounts rose 16% from the end of 2019 through the end of the second quarter this year. In July, we introduced a new credit card in China and the initial response has been tremendous. Turning to the development front. The pace of deal activity continues to pick up. In the second quarter, we signed another 135 deals, a second quarter record following a record first quarter. Additionally, despite supply chain issues, labor shortages, cost inflation and rising interest rates, the number of deals falling out of the pipeline remains below historical levels. Interest in conversions remains particularly strong given the breadth of our roster of conversion-friendly brands across chain scales as owners continue to seek out the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of the Marriott portfolio. Conversions represented 30% of room signings in the quarter. One win to highlight is a recent landmark agreement for 8 hotels in Vietnam with Vinpearl, a new owner to our system. The deal includes 6 conversion hotels that are expected to add 1,700 rooms to the system. Conversions also represented 25% of the roughly 17,000 rooms added to our system in the quarter. While construction timelines have lengthened a bit this year in most markets due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we still expect the number of room additions to ramp in the second half of the year. For the full year, gross additions are still anticipated to approach 5%. Given our announcement several weeks ago that we are suspending all operations in Russia, we now expect a 1.5% to 2% deletion rate for 2022. While our expectation for deletions outside of Russia remains at 1% to 1.5%, the deletion of 6,500 rooms in the country represents almost 0.5 percentage point. Now as a reminder, fees from Russia represented well under 0.5% of global fees in 2019. We have not been recognizing fees from Russia for many months now and the financial impact of these rooms leaving is de minimis. So, our net rooms growth for 2022 could now be 3% to 3.5% or 3.5% to 4% before factoring in the deletions in Russia. We remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid single-digit net rooms growth rate. The timing will largely depend on when new construction starts, which have trailed well below 2019 levels for the last 2 years really begin to accelerate, particularly here in the U.S. Construction timelines in the U.S. are currently just over 2 years for a limited service hotel and longer for full-service properties. Looking ahead with the largest footprint in the industry, strong builder affinity for our brands and the improving global travel environment, I am bullish about the company's future growth prospects for development and for the company overall. I want to take a moment and thank all of our associates around the world. Their commitment to taking care of our guests has helped produce our outstanding results and I am so very proud of their dedication and resilience. And now, I will turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Sean. The short answer is not really. The already robust leisure demand that we have seen in the last couple of quarters, continue to improve. Leisure room nights were up 14% to 2019 in the quarter and they were only up 11% in the first quarter. So, we continue to see acceleration and we continue to see more and more of this blended trip purpose. In my remarks, I talked a little bit about day-of-the-week patterns. And so I think that's quite encouraging to us as well. And then, finally, we have not talked a lot about international cross-border travel. While we are seeing improvement, we are not back to where we were pre-pandemic and we think that represents some upside on the leisure segment as well. And then the last thing I would say is all of those are comments about demand levels. We continue to see really encouraging pricing power on the leisure side as well. It's a little early to talk about the winter holidays. But as we look at Labor Day, for instance, we continue to see double-digit increases in ADR relative to where we were pre-pandemic. Thank you, Shaun. Hi, Joe. Of course. So as you know, for business transient, we rolled over special corporate rates since the beginning of the pandemic. We're just now starting the negotiation process for 2023. And so again, it's early, but we can certainly imagine those rates being up high single digits year-over-year in 2023. I think, much more the latter. Now I was quite thrilled with our conversion volume both on signings and openings in the second quarter. It is a competitive market for conversions. I'm quite pleased that we had more conversion openings than any of our peers in the quarter, and we will continue to try to do smart conversions, which means we will use the same capital discipline you've come to know us for even pre pandemic. I think to really see acceleration, and this is an industry comment as much as a Marriott comment, particularly in the U.S., you have seen a slowing in construction starts. Just over the last quarter, we have seen that start to tick up, although not to levels we saw in 2019. But I think we will do our best to continue to drive conversion volume and do everything we can to get shovels in the ground. You may know that I had the privilege to spend a little time with the administration last week, and one of the things that we spoke to the administration about was seeking assistance to resolve some of the supply chain issues that continue to slow some of the construction starts. And then maybe just to put a fine point on your question, Joe, our confidence in our ability to get back to that mid-single-digit net unit growth, there is a couple of things in the release. The fact that we had quarter-over-quarter growth in the pipeline, the fact that we continue to have more than 200,000 rooms globally under construction and that we continue to see accelerated volume in both signings and openings on the conversion front combined to strengthen that confidence. Thank you. Well, there is no question that the rapid improvement in occupancies in the shoulder days has been maybe a bit of a surprising but encouraging development. When we think about business transient demand, the small and medium-sized businesses, they are back. They are back above 2019 levels of volume. As you point out, the bigger corporate customers, they are not quite back yet. But even there, we continue to see steady improvement, albeit not necessarily as rapid as we might like. Thank you, Patrick. Sure. So maybe I can give you a couple of statistics, and Leeny may provide some color as well. When we look at bookings for \u201823 during 2022, we are down about 2% in revenue versus where we would have been for the bookings in 2019. But interestingly, ADR is up 16%. So we continue to see that strong pricing power. And we're even more optimistic, Robin, as you heard in our prepared remarks, because of the shorter booking window in group, even through the back half of this year and most certainly into \u201823, we expect those numbers to continue to improve as we see more and more short-term bookings. I continue to be quite bullish, Robin, on the trajectory of conversions for a few reasons. Number one, unlike some conventional downturns we've experienced in the past, where early in the downturn, you saw a lot of distress, the impact to our business was so severe that you saw the lenders being much more creative than accommodating with owners. So you didn't necessarily see a flood of distressed assets changing hands in the market. As demand and performance have recovered, there is the potential that there may be more assets in play, number one. Number two, the portfolio of conversion-friendly brands we have, particularly our soft brands, Tribute, Autograph and Luxury Collection is more robust than we've ever armed our transactors in any other recessionary environment. And I combine those two factors, and it drives my bullishness about that trajectory. Of course. Well, as Leeny mentioned in response to an earlier question, we do believe the recovery will continue to be driven by both occupancy and rate. You also heard her refer a bit to some of the murkiness beyond the end of the year. But we do expect both occupancy and rate continue to improve through the end of \u201822. And we continue to be pleased with the pace of rate recovery through the first half of this year. Thank you. Good morning. Well, what I can tell you, some of this may be a little more anecdotal, but the early days of the recovery were clearly dominated by leisure destinations, trailed significantly by what we saw in the urban core. In many of the major urban markets across the country and across the world, we continue to see a reasonably steady and encouraging improvement in terms of both occupancy and rate. And we hear anecdotally from our corporate clients. We're seeing more and more return to the office, which is driving business demand. And when we look at some of the big major markets that I think are decent indicators for us, you look at New York, for instance, that had an 86% occupancy in the quarter. You look at San Francisco, 78%; Washington, D.C., 76%; Los Angeles, 80%. You are seeing steady volumes of demand recovering in many of those markets that were trailing the leisure destinations. And I think just to give some context to that, we still saw in the second quarter in the U.S. and Canada, luxury rate up 23% in the quarter versus \u201819. So lots of questions around how much runway we have for luxury but another really solid quarter in terms of the luxury pricing. Yes. So maybe I'll try. SMEs represent now about 60% to 65% of our business transient demand, which is a bit higher than what we experienced pre pandemic. The bigger corporate clients continue to steadily improve. And over time, we expect to get maybe not all the way back but closer to where we were in terms of the mix of SMEs versus large corporate clients. But right now, it's in the 60% to 65% range that is the category I think you're talking about. Sure. Again, this will maybe be a bit anecdotal. We just held an event called The Exchange, which was where we hosted about 500 corporate and association meeting planners. In general sessions and in some smaller executive forums, we had a chance to talk to them and essentially ask the question you just asked. And I would say the two themes I heard most notably. Number one, they gave us high marks for our flexibility on issues like attrition during the pandemic. And I think they are hopeful we would continue to show that level of flexibility into perpetuity, which, as demand improves, we are tightening up a bit. And they understand that intellectually. They are just wishing for the good old days where they had maximum flexibility. The other theme we heard loud and clear is an increasing focus on the company's efforts around all things ESG and an increasing number of our \u2013 both corporate and association booking contracts. They are asking for not only our publicly stated goals, but for reports on our progress against those goals. And then one fine point that I forgot about from some of the conversations at The Exchange, they asked us from a technology perspective to do everything we can to make it easier for them to tack on a couple of leisure days to their reservation pre or post meeting, which was just another confirmation that this idea of blended trip purpose will likely endure well beyond the end of the pandemic. So, there is a couple of questions embedded there. I think our deal volume and our openings are off peak, but they are steadily recovering. The vast majority of our operating hotels and the vast majority of the projects in our pipeline are domestically owned. And so those domestic entities continue to benefit from the Central Government encouraging domestic travel across China. And many of those hotels are benefiting from increased volumes of domestic travel, albeit some pauses when certain markets go into lockdown. And so our expectation is a steady improvement, but we have not embedded in our guidance any sort of wholesale lifting of zero COVID policy that we have seen over the last couple of quarters. I would say it's very much a work in progress, but we are really encouraged by the metrics that we monitor through guest satisfaction surveys and particularly the intent-to-return numbers. We are not quite back to where we were pre-pandemic, but we have made meaningful and steady progress on those metrics. As you may recall from some prior earnings calls, in the depths of the pandemic, we suspended some of those quality metrics. Those are all back in place now, brand, standard, audits, guest surveys. And the teams \u2013 we just went through our quarterly business reviews. All of our teams around the world are keenly focused on driving intent to return. And we are pretty encouraged. And I think it's reflected in the manner in which our most loyal Bonvoy customers continue to engage. Our top tier within Bonvoy, the ambassador tier, has remained very active. 96% of our ambassadors had at least one stay or points transaction in \u201821, they averaged about 100 nights, and we see those metrics improving as well. We have rolled out our new housekeeping protocols, and the early returns from our guests is they like the certainty that, that offers. So, maybe I will go in reverse order, pre-pandemic, looking at a year like \u201819, we have seen steady reduction in the percentage of total room nights that came out of the OTAs. During the first 2 years with pandemic, as you might expect, we saw OTA volume rise, but direct bookings rose more rapidly. And I think it's reasonable to expect in the coming quarters that we would start to get back to the trend line we saw pre-pandemic of the total volume of OTA contribution moderating. I think your first question was really more around mix by segment. Back in \u201819 in round numbers, about 40% of our business was leisure. 37% was business transient. 20% was group and 4% was contract. In the second quarter, business transient had risen to about 32%. Leisure transient was 43%. Group was 21%, and contract was pretty steady at 4%. But remember, the Leisure segment was already our most rapidly growing segment even in 2019 before the pandemic did. And we continue to see \u2013 expect to see leisure to grow rapidly. And as I have said in some previous calls, this blending of trip purpose may make it that much tougher for us to tell you with absolute precision what that mix looks like. Good morning Dori. And I might just add on that, Dori, it was just towards the tail end of the quarter where you saw the U.S. government rolled back the inbound international testing requirement, and we think that's going to be another accelerant for cross-border travel. In fact, right after that policy change was announced, the USTA came out and estimated that they thought that would drive 5.4 million incremental visitors to the U.S. in the back half of the year with about $9 billion of spend. On the signings side, we have seen a bit of a slowing in select service here in the U.S., but some of that may be because of the high volume of conversions are disproportionately full service. What I can tell you is in terms of monthly approval volumes coming out of our development committees, we are seeing exactly what we would have expected, which is our large multi-unit long-term developers and owners of select-service hotels gearing their development organizations back up, and that's driving the sort of approval volume we have seen through the first half of the year. Well, thank you all for joining us. It's a compelling and exciting story about the resiliency of travel and the resilience of Marriott's business model. We look forward to seeing you all on the road soon, and thanks again for your interest."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Global RevPAR continued to rebound sharply and Marriott reported outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Record quarterly global fees and adjusted EBITDA were both 7% above the same quarter in 2019. Second quarter global RevPAR was down only 3% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Looking at the regions, in the U.S. and Canada, RevPAR came in ahead of our expectations largely due to stronger than anticipated growth in ADR and group demand. Compared to 2019, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada was up 1% in the quarter and up 3% in June. ADR has improved each month this year, reaching 9% above pre-pandemic levels in June. Occupancy further strengthened from the first to the second quarter on both an absolute basis and versus pre-pandemic levels. June occupancy of 76% was within 4 percentage points of the same month in 2019. In June, U.S. and Canada RevPAR more than fully recovered across all market types, primary, secondary and tertiary, for the first time since the pandemic began. It has been very encouraging to see demand come back so powerfully in major cities like New York, where RevPAR increased 7% versus June 2019. With orders opened in Europe, the room nights from international guests more than doubled in the region from the first quarter to the second. With this strong return of international travel, Europe has experienced the swiftest RevPAR recovery of all of our regions this year. RevPAR in Europe topped 2019 levels in June a remarkable 57 percentage point increase from January. Cross-border travel also helped drive strong second quarter results in the Middle East and Africa and in the Caribbean and Latin America area. Second quarter RevPAR rose 16% in EMEA and 13% in CALA compared to 2019. Asia-Pacific, excluding China, saw rapid RevPAR improvement during the second quarter as the region is now mostly open with India and Australia more than fully recovered. Second quarter RevPAR was down 22% compared to 2019 given the lack of travelers from Greater China and the fact that rigorous travel restrictions remain in place in Japan, one of our largest markets in the region. Greater China continues to lag the recovery of other regions due to its strict zero COVID policy. RevPAR during the quarter declined more than 50% compared to 2019 as a result of the lockdowns in many cities, including Shanghai and Beijing. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter driven by higher RevPAR rooms growth and another quarter of significant growth in our non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Those fees totaled $204 million in the second quarter driven largely by growth in our co-brand credit card fees, which rose a remarkable 38% year-over-year. Incentive management fees, or IMF, increased meaningfully in the quarter, reaching $135 million. Over half of our IMFs came from U.S. and Canada, where we earned more IMFs than we did in the second quarter of 2019. At the hotel level working closely with our owners and franchisees to contain operating costs while delivering superior customer service remains a key area of focus. Profit margins at our U.S. managed hotels were 3 percentage points higher than 2019 levels in the second quarter despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation. We are keeping an eye on wages and benefits as industry staffing challenges persist in certain markets. Yet we remain optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could offset this inflation in future years. G&A and other expenses totaled $231 million in the second quarter primarily due to higher incentive compensation accruals as well as increased travel expense. With COVID now essentially endemic, global borders overwhelmingly open and business somewhat more predictable, we are providing guidance for the third quarter and the full year. The full details are in our press release. There is still a higher than usual degree of uncertainty in our outlook, especially as it relates to Greater China, but we are encouraged by the positive momentum in demand across customer segments and robust ADRs in the vast majority of markets around the world. We expect the global RevPAR recovery to continue each quarter through the end of the year driven by improving occupancy and ADR compared to 2019 in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally. On a worldwide basis compared to 2019, we could see RevPAR flat to up 3% in the third quarter and down 6% to down 3% for the full year. Compared to 2021, global RevPAR in the third quarter could be up in the mid-30% range, and for the full year, it could be up around 50%. For the full year, we are now anticipating G&A expenses of $890 million to $900 million due to higher compensation accruals as well as travel expenses, but still well below [Technical Difficulty]. And we expect adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, above our prior full year peak in 2019. We now expect full year investment spending of $600 million to $650 million. Our guidance now includes roughly $200 million for maintenance capital in our new headquarters. Loyalty is still expected to be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring in the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. At the end of the second quarter, our leverage was in the low-end of our targeted range of 3x to 3.5x adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDAR. We resumed share repurchases during the quarter and have already bought 448 million of stock as of July 29 in addition to paying our dividend in the second quarter at $0.30 per share. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will make investments that enhance our growth and increase shareholder value, while returning any excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to our investment grade rating. Given our outlook for further global recovery and our powerful business model that is generating significant cash beyond our investment needs, we expect to return more than $2.2 billion to shareholders this year. This level of capital returns is included in the guidance we have provided today. Looking ahead, I am very optimistic about our future. Marriott is incredibly well positioned given the breadth and depth of our unparalleled global portfolio, our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, and the best team in the business. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Good morning. Sean, I think you said it best in your question that it really is back to where we were in terms of the way the model fundamentally works. As I said in my statement, we are at the low-end of the 3x to 3.5x adjusted debt to EBITDAR at the end of Q2 and we have given you a model that keeps us squarely and comfortably in that range. And we obviously want to keep our flexibility both in terms of investment opportunities as well as taking advantage of excess available cash. So, I think you will continue to see us move forward with the exact same approach that we have taken for some time. Hi, Joe. And Joe, just one follow-on, we talked about two record quarters of signings so far this year. And to your specific question, they did not involve a greater-than-usual element of capital from Marriott for those signings? Yes, it is. There is no doubt that the recovery has accelerated faster than we had originally anticipated. And I think it's both in rate and occ in varying parts of the world. I think the cross-border has been obviously incredibly encouraging to see that topped Europe as an example, meaningfully faster than expected. But yes, I think it is stronger than our expectations both a quarter ago. And then frankly, a quarter ago was better than we expected a quarter before that. So Robin, I'll add a couple of comments. I think the major theme we've got is in the quarter, for the quarter, in the year, for the year. In June, the benefit of that really got us to where group RevPAR was only down 1% in the month. So when we look at the rest of this year, from what's on the books currently, we are seeing low single digits for the rest of the year in terms of group revenue, while next year, we're still kind of in the 15% down, but I think you need to continue to think about this booking pattern, which is much closer to the actual event that has been filling in really nicely. So it's not that different for \u201823 versus a quarter ago except from what we're seeing in the quarter for the quarter, and even in the back half of \u201822, we're seeing some really great fill-in business that has got us pretty close to \u201819 levels where we could end up actually exceeding \u201819 levels in the back half of this year. Yes, that's total \u2013 that is definitely total group revenue. Again, it's obviously where we are seeing it fill in. It's not just rate. It's also occ as we fill in the business. But you're right, the rate on group has been performing incredibly well. So one other comment, Smedes and that is that \u2013 to remember that we're comparing to \u201819. So that on inflation adjusted numbers, rate has not kept up with kind of real rates. So in that regard, I think while it's fabulous and we're thrilled to see the consumers love travel and don't want to put it off, the reality is that there is inflation and that we are pricing these rooms on a very frequent basis and that, on a real rate basis, they are not back to 2019 levels. Sure. Yes. We are seeing \u2013 continuing to see hourly wages go up. And when I look at it compared to \u201819, the reality is, overall, and this comment is actually regarding U.S. and Canada, that it has kept up with inflation, if not just a teeny bit higher than that. It has slowed. The pace of increase has slowed. And one of the things that I think is interesting is to look at the positions that we're trying to fill if, for example, normal staffing levels were that we were trying to fill the final 95% to 100% of the positions we needed at the hotel level. Right now, we're at 93%. So it's definitely improved. It is not back to where we were in \u201819 in terms of the labor shortage, but we're definitely seeing steady improvement, and the wage increases have slowed. Outside the U.S., it's much more varied. It really depends on the particular market. And I would say Europe probably has seen some more similarities to the U.S., while in Asia Pacific, for example, there is really been far less of the kind of pressures that we've seen in the U.S. So a couple of things. One of the easiest ways to think about luxury is that rate has continued to stay very strong. But what we've also seen is that the markets that were previously weaker, like a New York or San Francisco, the luxury hotels in those markets are now filling in. They, on average, are not necessarily quite as high as in some of the resort markets. So it actually makes it look, on a blended basis, like the gains in ADR and luxury are not as strong, while the reality is just the opposite, that they continue to be quite strong. I think one of the most encouraging things to see is that the overall luxury portfolio is continuing to gain in both occ and rate. And then as Tony was talking about earlier, I think it's also particularly encouraging to see the premium market, the Marriotts, the Sheratons, the Renaissances in kind of all markets really recovering now more in the second quarter meaningfully than they were in the first quarter. So we really don't expect that we are depending on continued additional ADR gains in luxury through the rest of this year, but we do continue to see really strong demand. So I think it is tide-floats-all-boats view of what we're seeing, which is demand across all segments continuing to strengthen. Yes. Sure. Comparing to \u201821, it's $25 million to $30 million per point of RevPAR in \u201822 versus \u201821. We are not in a position yet to talk about \u201823, all of that budgeting work. But I would expect it to continue to be somewhat similar. It varies, as you know, depending on what part of the world the improvements happen. It's obviously more per point of RevPAR compared to \u201819. You get into the weeds on differences in comp sets, etcetera. But it is probably closer to $40 million per point if you are comparing a point of RevPAR in \u201822 to a point of RevPAR in \u201819. And just one other interesting stat that I think is helpful is that length of stay for \u2013 up almost 25% compared to 2019, as is the average size for new bookings. So, again, I think this all continues to emphasize that associations, companies, organizations are wanting to get their people together. We are always looking, but the numbers that I gave do not assume any additional asset sales this year. And I think to your question about revenue management strategy, as we think about going forward, it has been very encouraging to see the strength of group and the strength of group rate. So, as we think about all the possible outcomes for the economy over the next couple of years, that strength in group is quite encouraging. And then obviously, on the transient side, the booking window there is about three weeks. So, that tends to \u2013 which is, frankly, back to about where it was in \u201819, and that will vary with customers' needs and wants as we see things unfold. Good morning Dori. Sure. So, let's talk super high level at first, which is that if pre-pandemic, we were in the, call it, 18% to 19% sort of cross-border travel around the world that, that number fell and was down in the \u2013 a little bit north of 10% and then has clearly moved back up several hundred basis points, particularly as we got into Q2. But we are not back to the same level of cross-border travel. Obviously, particularly with Asia Pacific and Greater China still being very much domestic travel based. The thing I did find interesting in Q2 in the U.S. was that we were pretty close to being back to the number of international \u2013 the percentage of international nights. We were pre-pandemic at 5%. And in Q2, we were at 4% coming from cross-border travel. I think the biggest shift that you saw was obviously partly a function of opening kind of more comfort travel and then the strong dollar. And that had a massive impact on Europe in the summer, and you saw a very large influx of U.S. travelers coming into Europe, which helped their RevPAR tremendously. Well, again, as we talked about before, you have got the short booking window on transient, but you have also got holiday bookings when you look at December, when you look at Thanksgiving, Columbus Day as well as Labor Day. And I think across all of those, we continue to be reminded that people are not willing to give up travel and that you are seeing it in the strong rate and strong early bookings for those periods. And they are obviously overwhelmingly leisure bookings and group also continuing to fill in very nicely. So, I think we \u2013 when we look at what's on the books, as we move into either even September and October, while you are right that the percentage that is on the books is still relatively low on the transient side. The pace of those bookings is very encouraging. I would have to \u2013 I can get Jackie and Betsy to get back to you on the specifics for December \u201822 versus December \u201821. I think again, the overall comment that I will make is that we continue to see really strong bookings for the end of the year. One of the things that I talked about in luxury is the reality that as you see some of the other luxury markets start to fill in that aren't necessarily as high ADR as some of the resorts that starts to muddy the waters a little bit, but that's a good issue. Remember that right now, the percentage that is on our books for that period is probably under 5%. So, it's really quite small and making big sweeping statements with that small amount on the books probably doesn't make sense. But when we think about the pace for the holiday periods, we continue to be really encouraged. So, I will just give you one comment. I think the shift won't be a massive shift. I think there is still going to be a lot of social group events going into the fall as well. When we look at what's on the books, it was only down 1% right now from Q3. And here we are barely into Q3. So, I think we \u2013 as we said before, we have got the possibility that actually group ends up higher than 2019 relative to Q2 when it was still down a little bit. So, we are seeing great demand on the part of corporate customers for getting their people together. And I think you are going to continue to see the social events as well. So, I wouldn't necessarily a huge swing based on your comment that it is more a business-oriented quarter. The only other thing I will point out is that August is typically a seasonally cleaver [ph] months for us in group just because of the realities of family vacations and people not being in school. So, I think August, you should expect what we have always seen, which is a relatively seasonally more light period on the group side."

You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony.\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy rose to 64% with ADR an impressive 5% above March of 2019. COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world, but as global vaccination rates increase, case counts decline, and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe, many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy, leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel. Leisure demand, which had already fully recovered during 2021, has further strengthened this year, with first quarter global leisure transient room nights more than 10% above 2019. Recovery of business transient and group demand is still lagging leisure, but as greater numbers of employees returned to the office, demand has been rapidly improving. Additionally, day of the week trends continue to show that trips that blend leisure and business are on the rise. In March, in the U.S. and Canada, while Monday through Wednesday occupancy was down in the mid teens, occupancy during the shoulder days, Thursday and Sunday, was down in the single digits and occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was nearly in line with March of 2019. While still below pre-pandemic room nights, cross-border travel demand is growing slowly as more countries around the world reopen their borders and lift travel restrictions. Cross-border guests accounted for 14% of global room nights in the first quarter, a gain of around 100 basis points compared to a quarter ago, but well below the 2019 share of 19%. In the U.S. and Canada, March RevPAR was within 4% of 2019. Occupancy topped 68% during the month, and ADR accelerated to 6% over pre-pandemic levels. While the extent of RevPAR recovery still varies widely from city to city, overall progress during the quarter was widespread across all chain scales as well as market types that is primary, secondary and tertiary markets, RevPAR recovery saw meaningful improvement in March versus the fourth quarter. Luxury was the standout in the quarter with ADR a remarkable 27% above pre-pandemic rates. Group demand in the U.S. and Canada accelerated sharply during the first quarter. In March Group RevPAR was 16% below 2019 compared to down more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in new bookings has contributed to a meaningful improvement in Group pace for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, Group revenue pace for the remainder of 2022 was down in the high single digit range compared to 2019. We also expect additional short-term bookings to further boost Group revenues. April was the eighth month in a row where in the year for the year group bookings exceeded 2019 levels. Importantly, our sales teams remain focused on driving ADR, which has continued to rise for new bookings. ADR for managed hotel bookings made in January was 3% above 2019 levels, while ADR for bookings made in March had risen to 12% above pre-pandemic levels. Business transient demand in the U.S. also gained momentum during the quarter. Recovery in March improved notably compared to the fourth quarter, with business transient room nights down 10% to 15%. Special corporate accounts which tend to be larger companies have recovered more slowly than smaller sized businesses, which have now fully recovered. Special corporate new bookings strengthened in March and further advanced in April. Internationally, all regions except for Greater China experienced additional RevPAR recovery in March compared to the fourth quarter recovery. In the Middle East and Africa, where borders have been opened since late last year, first quarter performance was stellar, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. This was led by strength in the UAE from the World Expo in Dubai that ran from October of 2021 through March of this year. At the other end of the spectrum, in Greater China, where restrictions have been the most severe, RevPAR dropped significantly with the lockdown of several major cities, including Shanghai late in the quarter. We are keeping a close eye on trends in Europe. But outside of Russia, the war in Ukraine has not yet impacted demand. Cancellations have been minimal and as all countries in the region have removed or reduced travel restrictions, bookings across the rest of Europe have accelerated for spring and the summer high season. In Russia, we've closed our corporate offices and paused all future hotel developments and new hotel openings. There are currently 23 properties open in the country, though occupancies are modest. We continue to evaluate our operations in Russia, which represented well under 1% of our global fees in 2019. We are watching the horrific humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries with deep concern, and we're doing what we can to help those impacted in the region. I'm very proud of our teams that have been mobilizing to help those in need in numerous ways, including working with relief partners, and housing refugees at Marriott properties in neighboring countries. The power of Marriott Bonvoy was again evident in the quarter, as we remained focused on strengthening our loyalty platform for our 164 million members. Of course, member engagement has risen as travel demand comes back, but there has also been a significant increase in members earning and using points outside of our hotels. Our Bonvoy members are interacting with us more through everyday spending, thanks to our collaborations with companies like Uber. We've also seen incredible global interest in and engagement with our Bonvoy co-branded cards with new card acquisitions and card spend both up meaningfully year-over-year. The first quarter also marked our best quarter ever for direct digital bookings, which helped drive owner and franchisee profitability. Digital bookings were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019, partially driven by meaningfully higher downloads of our redesigned Bonvoy app, which were 70% above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to development, the number of deals presented at our monthly development committee meetings has continued to increase. We signed 124 deals globally through March of this year, a new first quarter record. Conversion activity remains a bright spot given the breadth of our roster of conversion friendly brands across chain scales, and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system. Conversions accounted for 22% of room additions in the quarter. Despite construction timelines having lengthened a bit so far this year, due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we expect openings to ramp up each quarter in 2022. Average construction timelines are currently just over two years for limited service properties and remain longer for full service properties. Looking ahead, we still expect full year growth rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. With financing starting to ease a bit, the industry has seen a notable ramp up in new construction starts in the first quarter, but they are still well below 2019 levels. However, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate, given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our momentum around conversions, and the largest pipeline in the industry. In closing, I feel extremely optimistic about our future. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands and over 8000 properties worldwide, our invaluable Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our numerous growth opportunities, and the best associates in the business, I believe Marriott is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued recovery ahead. I will now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations with global RevPAR down 19% compared to 2019. Gross fee revenues totaled $815 million in the quarter, almost doubling from a year ago, driven overwhelmingly by higher RevPAR. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees once again showed meaningful growth totaling $170 million in the first quarter up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year credit card fees. Incentive Management Fees or IMF are rebounding nicely and reached $102 million in the quarter. They comprise 13% of total gross fees, an acceleration from 7% in the year ago quarter, driven in part by strong performance at our U.S. and Canada hotels. Over 55% of our IMFs were earned at our industry-leading luxury properties. IMF from our comp luxury hotels were 10% above the first quarter of 2019, while IMF from our comp luxury resorts were up more than 60% over the same timeframe. Roughly 60% of IMFs were earned at our international properties during the quarter. Our owned and leased portfolio again generated positive profits totaling $44 million in the quarter due to international government subsidies and improved results at hotels in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Latin America and Europe. G&A and other expense totaled $208 million in the first quarter due to timing and lower travel cost as a result of the Omicron variant. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $759 million, down only 8% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while also containing operating costs. Our U.S. managed hotels profit margins were nearly back to 2019 levels in the first quarter, despite RevPAR down 16% compared to 2019. While industry staffing challenges persist, primarily in certain U.S. markets, we've made great progress since last summer in successfully hiring for open positions. As always, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation, but we're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we're very pleased with the positive momentum in demand we're seeing across customer segments in the vast majority of markets around the world. With the recent widespread easing of travel restrictions in many regions, employees returning to the office in greater numbers, increasingly positive travel sentiment, and our team's focus on ADR, we're even more optimistic than we were a quarter ago that we'll see meaningful additional global RevPAR recovery this year, assuming no major change in the global economic environment or the behavior of the virus. There's still too much volatility given uncertainty around travel restrictions in countries like China, and a high reliance on cross-border guests across our international markets to give global RevPAR or specific earnings guidance. But we do have more visibility in our largest markets, the U.S. and Canada, which is almost entirely dependent on domestic travelers. In the U.S. and Canada, occupancy and ADR continued to improve in April, and we estimate that RevPAR fully recovered to 2019 levels for the month. We're extremely pleased to reach this milestone roughly two years after the pandemic began. While demand still varies considerably across hotel types and markets, given current booking and ADR trends, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada to be roughly flat to 2019 in the remaining quarters of 2022. Internationally, we expect continued RevPAR recovery across markets that have not yet fully recovered, though the levels of progress will vary widely across regions. To further help with your modeling let me share some additional color, At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2022 RevPAR versus full year 2021 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For the full year, interest expense net is still anticipated to be roughly $350 million and our core tax rate is now expected to be around 24%. And G&A and other expenses are still anticipated to be $860 million to $880 million well below 2019. We still anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We could now see loyalty be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring and the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. With the meaningful pickup in demand we've seen an increase in redemption activity and expect this trend to persist. We've made meaningful progress in driving cash flow, managing expenses, and improving our credit profile. Given this progress, as well as the strength of our business and our confidence in our outlook improving further, we're very pleased to be resuming capital returns to shareholders sooner than we had anticipated. With leverage close to our target ratio of between 3 and 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are resuming our dividend at $0.30 a share in the second quarter, the first dividend in two years. We remain committed to our investment grade ratings, investing in growth that increases shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend, and share repurchases. Assuming the global demand environment continues to improve and that we are within our target leverage ratio range, we expect to resume share repurchases this year. Our business model has demonstrated terrific resilience and I want to thank our teams all over the world for helping us navigate the challenges over the past two years. It's thrilling to see so many hotels full of guests again, and we're very optimistic about the future of travel and the future of Marriott International. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you.  Thank you. Our first question will come from Steven Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Grambling: Hey, good morning. I just want to extend my condolences to everyone on the line as well as echo your thoughts Leeny on Laura.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, .\nSteven Grambling: Absolutely. To start things off, I guess, on the development environment particularly in China, amidst lockdowns, how might we be thinking through any impact there as you think about net unit growth or net room growth? How might conversions or other properties not explicitly in the pipeline impact additions for the year?\nAnthony Capuano: Great question. I'll answer it a few ways. As you know, many of the development projects that we entertain in Greater China come to us when they are well under construction. And so one of the metrics we use to evaluate growth pace is intake of MOUs or LOIs and we've seen pretty steady pace of MOU intake, even during the impact of the zero COVID policy across China. We have seen some construction interruption as we've seen here in the U.S. But for the first time, we're starting to see some real traction on the conversion side, which has not historically been particularly active source of rooms growth across Greater China.\nSteven Grambling: That's helpful. And then maybe one follow up on just the guidance and some of the comments that you made Leeny. What are the guardrails that we should be thinking about as it relates to credit card fees and the trajectory there, as well as any concrete impacts to working capital, given the complements of earning and burning points versus the point pull forward? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So I think generally as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years. And as you've probably heard us say, we actually saw credit card fees in Q1 2020 up 26%, compared to 2019. So they are really and obviously up a whole lot over last year as well. So it's a combination of two things, given one is that we continue to see overall credit card spend increase, and then our new card acquisition growth has also been impressive. So I think as you continue to see that moving forward, that's a strength. The other thing is, obviously we are a card that tends to be loved by people who love to travel. And so there again, as you see people returning to travel, I think that's also a great incentive with all the Bonvoy points that they earn. So I think you'll continue to see that be a strong force in the growth in our fees this year. And as you think about the cash flow, there are two points that I'd make on working capital. One is that generally speaking, as you remember, we are a negative working capital business overall, and as the company recovery continues, I think that trend will continue to show itself from the standpoint that our fees get paid so quickly, while it's not always the case that our payables have to be paid quite as quickly. So that will continue to help us on the working capital side. And as you pointed out, on loyalty we have moved from where we thought it was a slight source of cash to a slight use of cash as a result of higher redemptions. You know, I think you should expect as the year moves on that that will continue. But that is our current forecast for the year that ties in to these RevPAR numbers that we've talked about in the U.S.\nSteven Grambling: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. And I'd also like to extend my thoughts and prayers for Laura.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, Shaun.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nShaun Kelley: So, Tony or Leeny, just as we look at the outlook provided and appreciate, we're still, there's still enough volatility out there that you didn't want to extend yourselves too far yet. But if we think about some of your comments around the U.S. could you maybe just help us think through your puts and takes around sort of that outlook for flat for the, you know, relative to 2019 levels for the remainder of the year? Why not? What would be holding you back from maybe seeing a bit more improvement as the year goes on and we see Group and business travel fill in? Is there some give back over the summer as it might relate to luxury and mix or is there just some conservatism in that outlook?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, I think\u2026\nAnthony Capuano: There's a bit of conservatism in that outlook, but that conservatism is driven by what we've seen in terms of the booking windows. So we have much less visibility into Q3 and Q4, because the booking windows have been shortening generally and then the trend towards shorter group bookings is even more acute. And so we've shared with you the continued strength in leisure. We've talked to you a bit about the fact that we saw really strong group numbers at the end of the first quarter. We're feeling good about the last three quarters. But again, we're dealing with quite short booking windows. And the same is true with business transient. I think it's that murkiness of visibility in the back half of the year that's causing us not to be more bullish in terms of forecasting.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, Shaun, just to add one point to that, Q2, obviously there's a meaningful improvement in RevPAR obviously to get to this roughly flat kind of guidance that we've given. And to Tony's point, it's really when you start looking further out, that while we have seen tremendous in the quarter for the quarter, in the year for the year Group bookings, we have really given you what we see today. So from that standpoint, the variability that we've seen, we would agree that hopefully that adds some positivity as we move through the year, but we're really talking about what we see today.\nAnthony Capuano: And maybe just to illustrate that even a little further Shaun, we look at the Group activity in the U.S. and Canada in April. April was the eighth straight month where in the year for the year bookings were ahead of where we were in 2019. So great news for our business, but creates a bit more challenges into looking into Q3 and Q4.\nShaun Kelley: Understood, and then as just my follow up, could you just give a little bit more color on the large corporate activity? You did give some in the prepared remarks and I think you said it improved in April, as well. But you know, I think that's an important driver, particularly for Marriott, particularly some of the larger format and urban hotels. So maybe talk about how much you think that could reach by the balance or the end of the year, just kind of give us a sense of magnitude of improvement in that channel would be super helpful. Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: Of course. So in the U.S. and Canada, business transient room nights were down as we said in the prepared remarks between 10% and 15% in March. That's obviously a very meaningful improvement over what we saw in the fourth quarter, where business transient room nights were down about 30%. As you might expect, the volume coming out of small and medium sized companies has effectively fully recovered while the demand from larger companies still has a bit of the hill to climb to get back to where we were pre-pandemic. But we continue to see that improvement just more slowly than what we've seen from the small and medium sized companies.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nAnthony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff: Good morning, guys. I too, would like to extend my condolences. Laura was a very special person, she'll be missed.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Greff: Tony, how much or if any of new developments signing is related to developers, maybe it's not the right word to describe it, but pulling forward projects in front of and its stating higher development and financing costs for new projects?\nAnthony Capuano: I'm not sure I understand exactly your question, but let me give it a shot. The -- as we've talked about in the past, our developer and owner and franchisee community, they tend to be long-term investors in the sector. They don't as a general rule try to time construction starts or opening in a given month or a given quarter based on what they're seeing. I do think as we talked about last quarter, the availability of debt financing has likely been the single biggest impediment to an acceleration of new construction, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. And as that flow of debt capital starts to free up a little bit, that's why I think we're seeing a parallel increase in construction starts. It could actually be some pent up demand, but they're starting to believe, based on the statistics, that the recovery really has momentum and it's inspiring a bit more confidence in that development community to start putting shovels in the ground.\nJoseph Greff: Right, yes, that's a helpful way of answering that question. And then Leeny, I mean, I know you're not going to talk about the non-RevPAR fees within that franchising and other fee line. When you look at the composition of that line, I mean 34% of this quarter's franchise and other fees relates to the non-RevPAR fees is a similar percentage in the fourth quarter, when you think about it when you're coming out of this year, going into next year, how do you look at that percentage or how do you kind of look at the trajectory of credit card fees, and then on franchise fees there?\nLeeny Oberg: So yes, obviously, it's too soon to be talking about how we're really looking at credit cards then for 2023. But I think one thing to remember is that the residential is lumpy. So just as a reminder, last year, for example, we had $67 million in fees in 2021 for residential and the year before that, it was well under half of that. So just remember that that's a terrifically strong business for us and we love what we see in terms of signings and performance. But it is based on the pace of those sales of those residences and so it does vary up and down. But on the credit card part, which is, as you know, you know, well over half of the total number of, for example, 170 in the first quarter, I think steady as she goes, not willing to give a particular growth percentage, but I think it is really both a combination of strength of the consumer, so we're assuming that there's not a big change in the macroeconomic picture, and then number two is the connection to Bonvoy and to our overall system. And I think that that has definitely been part of what you're seeing in the growth. Just to remind you where we were pre-COVID is that the credit card growth within the high single digits pre-COVID, now obviously, we've seen better numbers than that as we're coming out of it.\nJoseph Greff: Thank you both.\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi good morning. I'm also reiterate, I'm also very sorry to hear about Laura, very tragic and certainly she will be very much missed.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nPatrick Scholes: I have two questions. The first one is, when you talk about your forecast for development growth, 3.5% to 4%, can you tell us what those percentages are by global region, and specifically China, Europe et cetera and North America?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, I'll have Jackie or Betsy give you the specific statistics. What I can tell you is, several quarters ago the composition of the pipeline pivoted towards a higher percentage of international. We're in the low 60% of the total pipeline is outside the U.S. And in terms of the relative pace of growth international versus domestic, we see international growing roughly twice as rapidly as our domestic rooms growth.\nLeeny Oberg: The other thing, just when you look at the pipeline, which is one of the kind of the interesting ways to look at it, Asia Pacific is basically roughly double the existing penetration of 17% split fairly evenly between China and APAC. And then I would say, for  and Europe, the pipeline is fairly similar relative to current proportions of the existing portfolio, though I will remind you, we had a very large conversion deal in  last year where they, you know, the conversions entered the pipeline quickly, and then actually opened, so it can vary. The other kind of disproportionate pipeline area is Middle East, Africa, where it's currently about 4% of our rooms, but it's about 9% of our pipeline. And then obviously, in the U.S., as we've talked about before, it's a bit lower relative to our existing makeup because of the strength in international.\nAnthony Capuano: And that's a great point on Middle East Leeny. In fact, if you look back pre-pandemic, Middle East rooms grew at about 6.5%. Last year, they grew closer to 8% and this year, they could grow in the mid teens.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, very good, color, thank you. And then my follow up question, you had talked earlier in the prepared remarks, I believe, about upticks in royalty redemption in 1Q in perhaps April. Now, how should we think about what you know, as a quantify it as a sort of a percentage of fees, what is loyalty redemption as a percentage of fees?\nLeeny Oberg: So the best way to think about it, I think, is in terms of nights and redemption nights are in the ballpark of 5% to 6% of our total overall nights. So just when you think about that, that obviously can be someone going to see somebody where it's at a hotel that is not very full, and so then the redemption rate that is paid to that hotel is actually lower than RevPAR, or it can be at a high redemption hotel, where it is obviously more like typical average daily rate. But I think overall, the best way to think about it is roughly 5% of total rooms.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. I appreciate the detail, thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citigroup.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Like everyone else on the call, I just wanted to say how sorry I was to hear about Laura. You know, .\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Smedes.\nSmedes Rose: I really wanted to just ask you a little bit more about what you're seeing and hearing from owners around wage pressure and from where that stands if people are seeing any sort of let up in that? And then just turning in general, I mean, I'm not sure you have the risk or their fears around recession have been heightened significantly, it's affecting this tightening phase. I'm just wondering if you have any kind of feedback from the corporates or whomever that you're speaking with, around heightened concerns on that front?\nLeeny Oberg: So I'll start on the wage pressures, and then we'll kind of tag team as we go through this Smedes. You know, there's no doubt if you remember, in the U.S. for us that the average hourly salary from January 21 to December of 21 was about a 10% increase. So, I mean, there's no doubt that in certain markets and certain hotels, places that that to get the hiring done, really did require some meaningful work. And what we are finding now that as, frankly, the world returns to a bit more normal pace of everything from availability of childcare, to the government subsidies winding down to, frankly, people feeling more comfortable about being in the workplace, that we have had an easier time getting positions filled, and we're basically back to a position of being relatively consistent with pre-pandemic levels of open positions. I'm really talking about the U.S. here. Now, I think certainly as you've described, we do expect to continue to have strong pressures on the wage and benefits front, we've worked incredibly hard on scheduling and productivity measures to make sure that we're managing the hotels the best way we can with also providing great service to the guests. And so right now, we've been thrilled to see that even with RevPAR our managed hotels, that RevPAR is meaningfully down compared to 2019, that our managed margins are similar. And we do expect to continue to see gains in occupancy as we move forward, which will be helpful. So we will keep some of this productivity gains, maybe 200 basis points ish around the world to help us offset inflation. But we're really glad that we reprice our rooms every night in terms of ADR, because there's no doubt that that's been a big help in managing these margins. And on the recession front, I guess I would point out two things. Number one, even though we saw a pretty tough GDP number come out recently, I think the factors behind it really point to actually a pretty strong economy. You've got really strong job additions in the U.S., you've got generally two jobs available for every person that's looking for a job, you've seen greater participation rates in chunks of the population. You've also seen that consumer spending continues to be really strong. And while the export markets for us were tough, I think in many respects, because of COVID in other parts of the world, they're really, I think there's good reason to think that the U.S. economy will continue to march along. Now, as we see what the Fed could do, that obviously could have a slowing impact. But we think there is still pent up demand and we believe that we'll continue to see strong demand for our hotels.\nAnthony Capuano: I think you said the second part of your question was really around big multinationals and attitudinally how they are thinking about travel going forward. I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically, whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically. I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. There's a bit of a tug of war right now, I think between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint, and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers, immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics, particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient, which suggests that that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction or are starting to win that tug of war a bit.\nLeeny Oberg: Just one other data point that I think you'd find interesting is that, in Q1 the average group size for all new loop bookings is actually up relative to Q1 2019 and one of the main factors is the length of stay. The length of stay is up 26% compared to 2019. So to Tony's point, I think there is a strong, compelling view that people being together to collaborate and to kind of have these meetings and be traveling, seeing your customers is still an important component of their business.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Good morning. I would like to share my condolences to yourselves and also to Laura's family as well as for the events, very sad to hear about that. In terms of first question, just want to answer the, ask the sort of U.S. North America guidance question in a slightly different way, is there anything particular in April that pushed April performance sort of disproportionately higher like the timing of Easter or Passover or anything that pushed that higher? And how would you think about the rest of the shape of Q2 where you say you've got a reasonable amount of visibility coming out of April?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, nothing particularly -- particular in terms of the calendar, not yet. We didn't see any particular impact from the timing of Easter. I think our view is generally it's just continued pace of demand recovery acceleration.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, that's helpful. And then just mentioned in the release, you mentioned the $33 million of government support that you received in the quarter. Just any color on where is that written support still being received and can we expect more of that to come through the rest of the year?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you very much. No, I think this is kind of the tail end of some of the government subsidies. These were specifically in Europe. And similar to some other places that we've seen during COVID it required immense amounts of data submissions, and applications put in that then needed some time to be processed by the various governments. So these are all related to 2020 and 2021 sorts of expenses on the part of the hotels, because much of this relates to our owned leased portfolio, support of the associates there that then the government supported. So we -- you may remember that we had about $18 million of these subsidies in 2021. Then we have $33 million that we've talked about here today, and I would not expect additional subsidies going forward.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nAnthony Capuano: Good morning.\nDavid Katz: And I'd like to share my condolences for literally everyone's loss.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, David.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, David.\nDavid Katz: Leeny, I wanted to just start with a capital returns perspective. You know, I think when we sat down to model for the last quarter, I guess it was early March. You know, we weren't really, you weren't really having us put much in this year and now we are. How could we sort of think about that the dividend enrolling for this year and potentially its ability to grow? And, more importantly, the stock buybacks, what you're kind of looking for or what data points, et cetera? Because we obviously, can't wait for you to tell us we have to sort of assert on our own?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, no, absolutely. I -- couple things as reminder, this is a fairly similar pattern to how we did it coming out of the great recession, which is to give ourselves a time to see how the recovery is moving forward. So assuming that we continue to see the strength that we are seeing and that our bookings are showing, I would expect that we will obviously continue the dividend and fairly, in fairly short order, get it back to the kind of payout levels that we had prior to the pandemic. Share repurchase is obviously the much more flexible part of our capital return strategy. And so there, we've got some gatekeepers. We really want to absolutely feel comfortable about the positioning in our 3 to 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA range, that's an important part. And as I talked about in my comments, we're very close to that. And we will, with the kind of cash generation that our business model has, we'll get there very quickly. But we do want to be squarely in that range and feel comfortable that with possible volatility, that we're in good shape to stay there. So I think you will see as we've talked about, that assuming things continue as they are, I would expect that you will see both, the dividend continue, as well as the share repurchase. The timing of when we may have a dividend increase David, is really all around the pace of acceleration, whether this pace of acceleration continues or whether it's different. I just think we need a little bit more time to feel comfortable, because the one thing you know, once we raise that dividend, we want to make sure that we're comfortable to keep it there. We're very comfortable with the $0.30, and we'll be looking at it literally every single month as we move forward.\nDavid Katz: Understood, I appreciate it. If I can follow up just quickly on another direction, we're clearly seeing an acceleration and business travel and group and one that's expected to keep accelerating. Can you share some data points on what you're seeing in terms of midweek and where it is relative to weekend? I assume that, BT and group are more of a midweek question, rather than sort of weekend. Some of that would be helpful as well.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure, absolutely. So, interestingly, Fridays, and Saturdays we definitely were seeing in March that they were right around pre-pandemic levels. The shoulder days of Thursday and Sunday, were down a bit mid-single-digit compared to 2019. Monday through Wednesday, they were down more in the mid teens. So that's where you classically can see. What Tony talked about earlier is that some of the special corporate negotiated business you would classically think are the Monday through Wednesday nights, they are probably the last to come back in terms of comparison to 2019, but again, improving nicely as we moved from January to February to March.\nAnthony Capuano: And then I think, given that pattern David, you also see it manifest itself a little bit in terms of rate. ADR on the weekends was about 4% higher than it was on weekdays in the quarter.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thanks a lot.\nAnthony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquaire Group.\nChad Beynon: Hi good morning.\nAnthony Capuano: Good morning.\nChad Beynon: Thoughts and prayers from myself for Laura's friends and family as well. I wanted to maybe ask kind of a pretty pointed question on IMF. Leeny, I know you've given us some sensitivity just around the model. But as we think about the recovery for IMFs particularly domestically, is there a level of growth of RevPAR growth we need to see versus pre-pandemic levels to get that domestic IMF level kind of back to where it was kind of factoring in for real expenses that we've seen for the past couple of years and any CapEx investments from your partners? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. So two things that I would say, a couple facts for you, just to give you perspective. I think again, we were really pleased with the IMFs in Q1. They were again, roughly 40% coming from the U.S. and Canada and frankly, that's only down so call that $40 million, that's only down from the high $50s millions in 2019, while RevPAR is obviously still down in the mid teens for those hotels in the U.S. So it's really impressive performance. In Q1 of 2019 56% of the U.S. hotels paid an IMF while in Q1 this year, we're at 12%. So to your point, there is a way to go and it obviously is they're much stronger in the luxury and resort hotels. It's a bit of a step function, where so many hotels have this jump from an owners priority in the U.S. to then where they actually earn that, there's not, I can't point to one particular kind of demarcation point that will tell you that we can jump. In the international it is much more aligned with what happens with base fees, because as you know, there with every dollar of profit we get a percentage with, without an owner's priority in many of the hotels. So in the U.S., obviously the big weakness right now is still on the occupancy side and that will help us particularly in the large cities as we continue to see gains in the premium hotels in the big cities. But there's unfortunately not one particular place that says if we get to ADR of whatever it is or RevPAR that that's going to clinch it. But again, one of the points that that I made during my comments, we're really pleased to see the margins being similar to 2019 levels and we're hopeful that that will continue for the rest of the year that we're able to hold on to this kind of margin performance for the full year for these manageable service hotels in the U.S. and that will obviously get us more IMF. If you remember, you can only recognize IMF as you look at your four year forecast. So that's one of the other things as we continue to move through the year, we'll have more visibility about the full year forecast for these hotels, which will also be helpful.\nChad Beynon: Okay, great, thanks. And then just a high level on the strength of the growing consumer demand in premium and luxury properties and resort areas, in the past couple of years you've made inroads, I guess from the same-store bases with elegant, with homes and villas, do you think you kind of have the right offerings or are there more opportunities for you organically or inorganically to expand in these markets?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, yes and yes is the short answer. I think, Chad, the even pre-pandemic, whether it be because of what we were hearing from our customers, what we thought would act as an accelerant to the appeal of the Bonvoy platform, we have been very focused on continuing to accelerate the growth of our resort portfolio. Similarly, we saw both from a development perspective and a guest perspective, tremendous appetite for all inclusive experiences in certain markets, and whole home rentals for certain trip types. I think you will continue to see us look at organic growth in all of those areas. And as has always been the case, continue to look at portfolio deals like what we did with Sunwing last year in the all inclusive space.\nChad Beynon: Thanks, Anthony, I appreciate it.\nAnthony Capuano: My pleasure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great, thank you. Let me add my condolences on the terrible loss of Laura.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, Robin.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nRobin Farley: My two questions, one is, I know you gave a great color on group accelerating in the year for the year. I don't know if I -- if you said where 2023 is booked relative to pre-pandemic, just kind of wondering if the kind of further group demand is coming back, you know, maybe with a little more certainty than the closer in? And then also Leeny, I just want to make sure I understood your comment about how is the loyalty program impacting your RevPAR guidance? I just wanted to make sure I understood that, thanks.\nAnthony Capuano: Great, I'll take the first one, Robin. So as we talked about 2022, we talked about the first quarter being down about 30. The remaining three quarters being down high single digits, which give us confidence that we will end up down 15-ish for 2022, although that could improve meaningfully given the short-term booking window that we've seen. As we look into 2023, looking at what's on the books today, we're down about 15% relative to 2019. But take my comment about booking window we think there is massive opportunity to close that gap between now and the beginning of 2023.\nLeeny Oberg: And Robin, it's worth noting that the rate for 2023 has improved relative to a quarter ago, when we look at the rate on the group pace for 2023. And as Tony said, we would continue to expect to see in the year for the year bookings.\nAnthony Capuano: When we talked to you last quarter Robin, about group, 2023 ADR was pacing up about 4%. As we sit here today, we're up about 6.5%.\nLeeny Oberg: And on your question about loyalty, no meaningful impact. So, loyalty redemptions have been about 5% of our room nights pre-pandemic and are now. So they kind of fit in with the overall scheme of how those hotels are doing, depending on what market and what tier they are. So no particular impact that's any different from when we normally look at our RevPAR performance.\nRobin Farley: Okay, all right. That's great. Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.\nVince Ciepiel: Great, thanks. I also want to express my condolences for Laura. A question on profitability, you mentioned managed hotels being back. I know in the past, you have discussed finding a balance between owner profitability and guest expectations, and I'm curious how do you think you're doing the year-to-date specifically around where you're at with housekeeping and food and beverage, and reintroducing those in a manner that's meeting guest expectations?\nAnthony Capuano: So I'll try to answer that qualitatively and Leeny may provide a little color in terms of margins. I would say, we are making good progress trying to strike that right balance. We will be landing on our housekeeping solution and announcing that probably towards the end of the second quarter. I think in the markets where demand has recovered most quickly, I think we're doing a particularly strong job of striking that right balance. In some of the urban markets, where demand has been a bit more slow to recover, I think we are on the right path, but we still have some work to do in front of us.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. And then second unrelated, came up earlier on the home sharing business, travel peer in that space, just printed 1Q results that were almost double that of 2019 levels. So I'm curious how your homes and villas by Marriott business has been performing, and how you think about the level of investment that you've made in that space, and kind of where you go from here?\nAnthony Capuano: Sure. So I think we talked last quarter, the growth of the platform itself in terms of listings has been pretty remarkable. Pre-pandemic, we had 2000 to 3000 listings. We find ourselves today with about 57,000 listings at the end of the first quarter, still tiny relative to some of the peers in that space. But again, I think distinguished a bit because the composition of our portfolio is 100% multi-bedroom full homes. These are not spare rooms or couches or anything else. These are full, multi-bedroom homes. As you would expect with that sort of exponential growth in the sheer volume of listings, we've seen a very meaningful uptick in the revenue coming through that platform.\nLeeny Oberg: And I'll turn it on the financial side is just a reminder that this is extremely small relative to kind of the overall size of Marriott from a financial standpoint, really across the spectrum of both investment as well as profitability. And from that perspective, I would expect to see it the same way moving forward. This has been a really important part of our overall ecosystem, and when we think about it, 90% of the bookings in HBMI  or from Bonvoy member, and that is just great recognition of the extra strength that it gives our overall system. But from an overall perspective to Marriott, I would not expect for you to see it be a meaningful part of our earnings stream in the near-term.\nJackie Burka McConagha: Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for any additional or closing remarks.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, operator. First, let me thank you all for your heartfelt condolences. I know how special Laura was to you both as a friend and a colleague, so thank you for those kind words. Thanks for your interest and participation today and we look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming weeks and months. Have a great day, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jackie and thank you all for joining us this morning. Global demand rebounded strongly and swiftly during the first quarter after a brief Omicron related slowdown early in the year. In March, worldwide RevPAR was just 9% below 2019. Occupancy rose to 64% with ADR an impressive 5% above March of 2019. COVID-19 is still impacting our business to varying degrees around the world, but as global vaccination rates increase, case counts decline, and new COVID variants are tending to be less severe, many countries have started to cautiously adopt a live with COVID policy, leading to a rise in demand for all types of travel. Leisure demand, which had already fully recovered during 2021, has further strengthened this year, with first quarter global leisure transient room nights more than 10% above 2019. Recovery of business transient and group demand is still lagging leisure, but as greater numbers of employees returned to the office, demand has been rapidly improving. Additionally, day of the week trends continue to show that trips that blend leisure and business are on the rise. In March, in the U.S. and Canada, while Monday through Wednesday occupancy was down in the mid teens, occupancy during the shoulder days, Thursday and Sunday, was down in the single digits and occupancy on Fridays and Saturdays was nearly in line with March of 2019. While still below pre-pandemic room nights, cross-border travel demand is growing slowly as more countries around the world reopen their borders and lift travel restrictions. Cross-border guests accounted for 14% of global room nights in the first quarter, a gain of around 100 basis points compared to a quarter ago, but well below the 2019 share of 19%. In the U.S. and Canada, March RevPAR was within 4% of 2019. Occupancy topped 68% during the month, and ADR accelerated to 6% over pre-pandemic levels. While the extent of RevPAR recovery still varies widely from city to city, overall progress during the quarter was widespread across all chain scales as well as market types that is primary, secondary and tertiary markets, RevPAR recovery saw meaningful improvement in March versus the fourth quarter. Luxury was the standout in the quarter with ADR a remarkable 27% above pre-pandemic rates. Group demand in the U.S. and Canada accelerated sharply during the first quarter. In March Group RevPAR was 16% below 2019 compared to down more than 30% in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth in new bookings has contributed to a meaningful improvement in Group pace for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, Group revenue pace for the remainder of 2022 was down in the high single digit range compared to 2019. We also expect additional short-term bookings to further boost Group revenues. April was the eighth month in a row where in the year for the year group bookings exceeded 2019 levels. Importantly, our sales teams remain focused on driving ADR, which has continued to rise for new bookings. ADR for managed hotel bookings made in January was 3% above 2019 levels, while ADR for bookings made in March had risen to 12% above pre-pandemic levels. Business transient demand in the U.S. also gained momentum during the quarter. Recovery in March improved notably compared to the fourth quarter, with business transient room nights down 10% to 15%. Special corporate accounts which tend to be larger companies have recovered more slowly than smaller sized businesses, which have now fully recovered. Special corporate new bookings strengthened in March and further advanced in April. Internationally, all regions except for Greater China experienced additional RevPAR recovery in March compared to the fourth quarter recovery. In the Middle East and Africa, where borders have been opened since late last year, first quarter performance was stellar, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 for the second quarter in a row. This was led by strength in the UAE from the World Expo in Dubai that ran from October of 2021 through March of this year. At the other end of the spectrum, in Greater China, where restrictions have been the most severe, RevPAR dropped significantly with the lockdown of several major cities, including Shanghai late in the quarter. We are keeping a close eye on trends in Europe. But outside of Russia, the war in Ukraine has not yet impacted demand. Cancellations have been minimal and as all countries in the region have removed or reduced travel restrictions, bookings across the rest of Europe have accelerated for spring and the summer high season. In Russia, we've closed our corporate offices and paused all future hotel developments and new hotel openings. There are currently 23 properties open in the country, though occupancies are modest. We continue to evaluate our operations in Russia, which represented well under 1% of our global fees in 2019. We are watching the horrific humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighboring countries with deep concern, and we're doing what we can to help those impacted in the region. I'm very proud of our teams that have been mobilizing to help those in need in numerous ways, including working with relief partners, and housing refugees at Marriott properties in neighboring countries. The power of Marriott Bonvoy was again evident in the quarter, as we remained focused on strengthening our loyalty platform for our 164 million members. Of course, member engagement has risen as travel demand comes back, but there has also been a significant increase in members earning and using points outside of our hotels. Our Bonvoy members are interacting with us more through everyday spending, thanks to our collaborations with companies like Uber. We've also seen incredible global interest in and engagement with our Bonvoy co-branded cards with new card acquisitions and card spend both up meaningfully year-over-year. The first quarter also marked our best quarter ever for direct digital bookings, which helped drive owner and franchisee profitability. Digital bookings were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019, partially driven by meaningfully higher downloads of our redesigned Bonvoy app, which were 70% above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to development, the number of deals presented at our monthly development committee meetings has continued to increase. We signed 124 deals globally through March of this year, a new first quarter record. Conversion activity remains a bright spot given the breadth of our roster of conversion friendly brands across chain scales, and the meaningful top and bottom line benefits associated with being part of our system. Conversions accounted for 22% of room additions in the quarter. Despite construction timelines having lengthened a bit so far this year, due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, we expect openings to ramp up each quarter in 2022. Average construction timelines are currently just over two years for limited service properties and remain longer for full service properties. Looking ahead, we still expect full year growth rooms growth to approach 5% and deletions of 1% to 1.5%, leading to anticipated net rooms growth of 3.5% to 4%. While signing activity has been picking up nicely 2022 gross room additions are expected to be impacted by the diminished construction starts the industry has experienced throughout the pandemic, particularly here in the U.S. With financing starting to ease a bit, the industry has seen a notable ramp up in new construction starts in the first quarter, but they are still well below 2019 levels. However, we remain confident that over the next several years, we will return to our pre-pandemic mid-single-digit net rooms growth rate, given the improving global environment, the attractiveness of our brands, our strong development activity, our momentum around conversions, and the largest pipeline in the industry. In closing, I feel extremely optimistic about our future. With our unparalleled portfolio of 30 global brands and over 8000 properties worldwide, our invaluable Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our numerous growth opportunities, and the best associates in the business, I believe Marriott is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continued recovery ahead. I will now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Great question. I'll answer it a few ways. As you know, many of the development projects that we entertain in Greater China come to us when they are well under construction. And so one of the metrics we use to evaluate growth pace is intake of MOUs or LOIs and we've seen pretty steady pace of MOU intake, even during the impact of the zero COVID policy across China. We have seen some construction interruption as we've seen here in the U.S. But for the first time, we're starting to see some real traction on the conversion side, which has not historically been particularly active source of rooms growth across Greater China. Thank you, Shaun. There's a bit of conservatism in that outlook, but that conservatism is driven by what we've seen in terms of the booking windows. So we have much less visibility into Q3 and Q4, because the booking windows have been shortening generally and then the trend towards shorter group bookings is even more acute. And so we've shared with you the continued strength in leisure. We've talked to you a bit about the fact that we saw really strong group numbers at the end of the first quarter. We're feeling good about the last three quarters. But again, we're dealing with quite short booking windows. And the same is true with business transient. I think it's that murkiness of visibility in the back half of the year that's causing us not to be more bullish in terms of forecasting. And maybe just to illustrate that even a little further Shaun, we look at the Group activity in the U.S. and Canada in April. April was the eighth straight month where in the year for the year bookings were ahead of where we were in 2019. So great news for our business, but creates a bit more challenges into looking into Q3 and Q4. Of course. So in the U.S. and Canada, business transient room nights were down as we said in the prepared remarks between 10% and 15% in March. That's obviously a very meaningful improvement over what we saw in the fourth quarter, where business transient room nights were down about 30%. As you might expect, the volume coming out of small and medium sized companies has effectively fully recovered while the demand from larger companies still has a bit of the hill to climb to get back to where we were pre-pandemic. But we continue to see that improvement just more slowly than what we've seen from the small and medium sized companies. Of course. Thank you. I'm not sure I understand exactly your question, but let me give it a shot. The -- as we've talked about in the past, our developer and owner and franchisee community, they tend to be long-term investors in the sector. They don't as a general rule try to time construction starts or opening in a given month or a given quarter based on what they're seeing. I do think as we talked about last quarter, the availability of debt financing has likely been the single biggest impediment to an acceleration of new construction, particularly in the U.S. and Canada. And as that flow of debt capital starts to free up a little bit, that's why I think we're seeing a parallel increase in construction starts. It could actually be some pent up demand, but they're starting to believe, based on the statistics, that the recovery really has momentum and it's inspiring a bit more confidence in that development community to start putting shovels in the ground. Thanks, Joe. Thank you. Yes, I'll have Jackie or Betsy give you the specific statistics. What I can tell you is, several quarters ago the composition of the pipeline pivoted towards a higher percentage of international. We're in the low 60% of the total pipeline is outside the U.S. And in terms of the relative pace of growth international versus domestic, we see international growing roughly twice as rapidly as our domestic rooms growth. And that's a great point on Middle East Leeny. In fact, if you look back pre-pandemic, Middle East rooms grew at about 6.5%. Last year, they grew closer to 8% and this year, they could grow in the mid teens. Thank you. I think you said the second part of your question was really around big multinationals and attitudinally how they are thinking about travel going forward. I'll speak both anecdotally and then statistically, whether it's meeting with big multinationals here domestically. I was in Europe last week and met with about 30 travel managers for multinationals across Europe. There's a bit of a tug of war right now, I think between managing travel costs and being mindful of carbon footprint, and that's being pulled by the absolute desire to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers, immerse new employees into corporate cultures. And the statistics, particularly that improvement to down 10% to 15% in business transient, which suggests that that appetite for the benefits of in-person interaction or are starting to win that tug of war a bit. Yes, nothing particularly -- particular in terms of the calendar, not yet. We didn't see any particular impact from the timing of Easter. I think our view is generally it's just continued pace of demand recovery acceleration. Good morning. Thank you, David. And then I think, given that pattern David, you also see it manifest itself a little bit in terms of rate. ADR on the weekends was about 4% higher than it was on weekdays in the quarter. Of course. Good morning. Yes, yes and yes is the short answer. I think, Chad, the even pre-pandemic, whether it be because of what we were hearing from our customers, what we thought would act as an accelerant to the appeal of the Bonvoy platform, we have been very focused on continuing to accelerate the growth of our resort portfolio. Similarly, we saw both from a development perspective and a guest perspective, tremendous appetite for all inclusive experiences in certain markets, and whole home rentals for certain trip types. I think you will continue to see us look at organic growth in all of those areas. And as has always been the case, continue to look at portfolio deals like what we did with Sunwing last year in the all inclusive space. My pleasure. Thank you, Robin. Great, I'll take the first one, Robin. So as we talked about 2022, we talked about the first quarter being down about 30. The remaining three quarters being down high single digits, which give us confidence that we will end up down 15-ish for 2022, although that could improve meaningfully given the short-term booking window that we've seen. As we look into 2023, looking at what's on the books today, we're down about 15% relative to 2019. But take my comment about booking window we think there is massive opportunity to close that gap between now and the beginning of 2023. When we talked to you last quarter Robin, about group, 2023 ADR was pacing up about 4%. As we sit here today, we're up about 6.5%. Thanks, Robin. So I'll try to answer that qualitatively and Leeny may provide a little color in terms of margins. I would say, we are making good progress trying to strike that right balance. We will be landing on our housekeeping solution and announcing that probably towards the end of the second quarter.

            "content": "Thank you, operator. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to remember Laura Paugh, a trusted and valued friend and colleague to many of us on this call. As most of you know, Laura tragically passed away after a car accident a few weeks ago. Laura was smart, helpful, witty and unfailingly honest to all who knew her. We'll miss her incredible spirit and are committed to honor her legacy at Marriott. Laura's family was her greatest achievement and we're holding them in our thoughts and prayers. And now I'll turn the call over to Jackie. Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results came in ahead of our expectations with global RevPAR down 19% compared to 2019. Gross fee revenues totaled $815 million in the quarter, almost doubling from a year ago, driven overwhelmingly by higher RevPAR. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees once again showed meaningful growth totaling $170 million in the first quarter up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to significantly higher year-over-year credit card fees. Incentive Management Fees or IMF are rebounding nicely and reached $102 million in the quarter. They comprise 13% of total gross fees, an acceleration from 7% in the year ago quarter, driven in part by strong performance at our U.S. and Canada hotels. Over 55% of our IMFs were earned at our industry-leading luxury properties. IMF from our comp luxury hotels were 10% above the first quarter of 2019, while IMF from our comp luxury resorts were up more than 60% over the same timeframe. Roughly 60% of IMFs were earned at our international properties during the quarter. Our owned and leased portfolio again generated positive profits totaling $44 million in the quarter due to international government subsidies and improved results at hotels in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Latin America and Europe. G&A and other expense totaled $208 million in the first quarter due to timing and lower travel cost as a result of the Omicron variant. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $759 million, down only 8% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We remain focused on working closely with our owners and franchisees to deliver superior customer service, while also containing operating costs. Our U.S. managed hotels profit margins were nearly back to 2019 levels in the first quarter, despite RevPAR down 16% compared to 2019. While industry staffing challenges persist, primarily in certain U.S. markets, we've made great progress since last summer in successfully hiring for open positions. As always, we're keeping a close eye on wage and benefit inflation, but we're optimistic that our cost reduction efforts could mitigate inflation in future years. As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we're very pleased with the positive momentum in demand we're seeing across customer segments in the vast majority of markets around the world. With the recent widespread easing of travel restrictions in many regions, employees returning to the office in greater numbers, increasingly positive travel sentiment, and our team's focus on ADR, we're even more optimistic than we were a quarter ago that we'll see meaningful additional global RevPAR recovery this year, assuming no major change in the global economic environment or the behavior of the virus. There's still too much volatility given uncertainty around travel restrictions in countries like China, and a high reliance on cross-border guests across our international markets to give global RevPAR or specific earnings guidance. But we do have more visibility in our largest markets, the U.S. and Canada, which is almost entirely dependent on domestic travelers. In the U.S. and Canada, occupancy and ADR continued to improve in April, and we estimate that RevPAR fully recovered to 2019 levels for the month. We're extremely pleased to reach this milestone roughly two years after the pandemic began. While demand still varies considerably across hotel types and markets, given current booking and ADR trends, we expect RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada to be roughly flat to 2019 in the remaining quarters of 2022. Internationally, we expect continued RevPAR recovery across markets that have not yet fully recovered, though the levels of progress will vary widely across regions. To further help with your modeling let me share some additional color, At current RevPAR levels, we still expect the sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2022 RevPAR versus full year 2021 could be around $25 million to $30 million of fees. As we've seen, the relationship is not linear given the variability of IMF and the inclusion of non-RevPAR related franchise fees. For the full year, interest expense net is still anticipated to be roughly $350 million and our core tax rate is now expected to be around 24%. And G&A and other expenses are still anticipated to be $860 million to $880 million well below 2019. We still anticipate full year investment spending of $600 million to $700 million, which includes roughly $250 million for maintenance capital and our new headquarters. We could now see loyalty be a slight use of cash for the full year before factoring and the reduced payments received from the credit card companies. With the meaningful pickup in demand we've seen an increase in redemption activity and expect this trend to persist. We've made meaningful progress in driving cash flow, managing expenses, and improving our credit profile. Given this progress, as well as the strength of our business and our confidence in our outlook improving further, we're very pleased to be resuming capital returns to shareholders sooner than we had anticipated. With leverage close to our target ratio of between 3 and 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, we are resuming our dividend at $0.30 a share in the second quarter, the first dividend in two years. We remain committed to our investment grade ratings, investing in growth that increases shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend, and share repurchases. Assuming the global demand environment continues to improve and that we are within our target leverage ratio range, we expect to resume share repurchases this year. Our business model has demonstrated terrific resilience and I want to thank our teams all over the world for helping us navigate the challenges over the past two years. It's thrilling to see so many hotels full of guests again, and we're very optimistic about the future of travel and the future of Marriott International. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Thank you, . Sure. So I think generally as we've talked about the credit cards, it's been a tremendously resilient and steady force in our fees over the past few years. And as you've probably heard us say, we actually saw credit card fees in Q1 2020 up 26%, compared to 2019. So they are really and obviously up a whole lot over last year as well. So it's a combination of two things, given one is that we continue to see overall credit card spend increase, and then our new card acquisition growth has also been impressive. So I think as you continue to see that moving forward, that's a strength. The other thing is, obviously we are a card that tends to be loved by people who love to travel. And so there again, as you see people returning to travel, I think that's also a great incentive with all the Bonvoy points that they earn. So I think you'll continue to see that be a strong force in the growth in our fees this year. And as you think about the cash flow, there are two points that I'd make on working capital. One is that generally speaking, as you remember, we are a negative working capital business overall, and as the company recovery continues, I think that trend will continue to show itself from the standpoint that our fees get paid so quickly, while it's not always the case that our payables have to be paid quite as quickly. So that will continue to help us on the working capital side. And as you pointed out, on loyalty we have moved from where we thought it was a slight source of cash to a slight use of cash as a result of higher redemptions. You know, I think you should expect as the year moves on that that will continue. But that is our current forecast for the year that ties in to these RevPAR numbers that we've talked about in the U.S. Thank you. Yes, I think... Yes, Shaun, just to add one point to that, Q2, obviously there's a meaningful improvement in RevPAR obviously to get to this roughly flat kind of guidance that we've given. And to Tony's point, it's really when you start looking further out, that while we have seen tremendous in the quarter for the quarter, in the year for the year Group bookings, we have really given you what we see today. So from that standpoint, the variability that we've seen, we would agree that hopefully that adds some positivity as we move through the year, but we're really talking about what we see today. Good morning, Joe. So yes, obviously, it's too soon to be talking about how we're really looking at credit cards then for 2023. But I think one thing to remember is that the residential is lumpy. So just as a reminder, last year, for example, we had $67 million in fees in 2021 for residential and the year before that, it was well under half of that. So just remember that that's a terrifically strong business for us and we love what we see in terms of signings and performance. But it is based on the pace of those sales of those residences and so it does vary up and down. But on the credit card part, which is, as you know, you know, well over half of the total number of, for example, 170 in the first quarter, I think steady as she goes, not willing to give a particular growth percentage, but I think it is really both a combination of strength of the consumer, so we're assuming that there's not a big change in the macroeconomic picture, and then number two is the connection to Bonvoy and to our overall system. And I think that that has definitely been part of what you're seeing in the growth. Just to remind you where we were pre-COVID is that the credit card growth within the high single digits pre-COVID, now obviously, we've seen better numbers than that as we're coming out of it. Good morning. Thank you. The other thing, just when you look at the pipeline, which is one of the kind of the interesting ways to look at it, Asia Pacific is basically roughly double the existing penetration of 17% split fairly evenly between China and APAC. And then I would say, for  and Europe, the pipeline is fairly similar relative to current proportions of the existing portfolio, though I will remind you, we had a very large conversion deal in  last year where they, you know, the conversions entered the pipeline quickly, and then actually opened, so it can vary. The other kind of disproportionate pipeline area is Middle East, Africa, where it's currently about 4% of our rooms, but it's about 9% of our pipeline. And then obviously, in the U.S., as we've talked about before, it's a bit lower relative to our existing makeup because of the strength in international. So the best way to think about it, I think, is in terms of nights and redemption nights are in the ballpark of 5% to 6% of our total overall nights. So just when you think about that, that obviously can be someone going to see somebody where it's at a hotel that is not very full, and so then the redemption rate that is paid to that hotel is actually lower than RevPAR, or it can be at a high redemption hotel, where it is obviously more like typical average daily rate. But I think overall, the best way to think about it is roughly 5% of total rooms. Thank you, Smedes. So I'll start on the wage pressures, and then we'll kind of tag team as we go through this Smedes. You know, there's no doubt if you remember, in the U.S. for us that the average hourly salary from January 21 to December of 21 was about a 10% increase. So, I mean, there's no doubt that in certain markets and certain hotels, places that that to get the hiring done, really did require some meaningful work. And what we are finding now that as, frankly, the world returns to a bit more normal pace of everything from availability of childcare, to the government subsidies winding down to, frankly, people feeling more comfortable about being in the workplace, that we have had an easier time getting positions filled, and we're basically back to a position of being relatively consistent with pre-pandemic levels of open positions. I'm really talking about the U.S. here. Now, I think certainly as you've described, we do expect to continue to have strong pressures on the wage and benefits front, we've worked incredibly hard on scheduling and productivity measures to make sure that we're managing the hotels the best way we can with also providing great service to the guests. And so right now, we've been thrilled to see that even with RevPAR our managed hotels, that RevPAR is meaningfully down compared to 2019, that our managed margins are similar. And we do expect to continue to see gains in occupancy as we move forward, which will be helpful. So we will keep some of this productivity gains, maybe 200 basis points ish around the world to help us offset inflation. But we're really glad that we reprice our rooms every night in terms of ADR, because there's no doubt that that's been a big help in managing these margins. And on the recession front, I guess I would point out two things. Number one, even though we saw a pretty tough GDP number come out recently, I think the factors behind it really point to actually a pretty strong economy. You've got really strong job additions in the U.S., you've got generally two jobs available for every person that's looking for a job, you've seen greater participation rates in chunks of the population. You've also seen that consumer spending continues to be really strong. And while the export markets for us were tough, I think in many respects, because of COVID in other parts of the world, they're really, I think there's good reason to think that the U.S. economy will continue to march along. Now, as we see what the Fed could do, that obviously could have a slowing impact. But we think there is still pent up demand and we believe that we'll continue to see strong demand for our hotels. Just one other data point that I think you'd find interesting is that, in Q1 the average group size for all new loop bookings is actually up relative to Q1 2019 and one of the main factors is the length of stay. The length of stay is up 26% compared to 2019. So to Tony's point, I think there is a strong, compelling view that people being together to collaborate and to kind of have these meetings and be traveling, seeing your customers is still an important component of their business. Thank you very much. No, I think this is kind of the tail end of some of the government subsidies. These were specifically in Europe. And similar to some other places that we've seen during COVID it required immense amounts of data submissions, and applications put in that then needed some time to be processed by the various governments. So these are all related to 2020 and 2021 sorts of expenses on the part of the hotels, because much of this relates to our owned leased portfolio, support of the associates there that then the government supported. So we -- you may remember that we had about $18 million of these subsidies in 2021. Then we have $33 million that we've talked about here today, and I would not expect additional subsidies going forward. Thank you, David. Yes, no, absolutely. I -- couple things as reminder, this is a fairly similar pattern to how we did it coming out of the great recession, which is to give ourselves a time to see how the recovery is moving forward. So assuming that we continue to see the strength that we are seeing and that our bookings are showing, I would expect that we will obviously continue the dividend and fairly, in fairly short order, get it back to the kind of payout levels that we had prior to the pandemic. Share repurchase is obviously the much more flexible part of our capital return strategy. And so there, we've got some gatekeepers. We really want to absolutely feel comfortable about the positioning in our 3 to 3.5 times adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA range, that's an important part. And as I talked about in my comments, we're very close to that. And we will, with the kind of cash generation that our business model has, we'll get there very quickly. But we do want to be squarely in that range and feel comfortable that with possible volatility, that we're in good shape to stay there. So I think you will see as we've talked about, that assuming things continue as they are, I would expect that you will see both, the dividend continue, as well as the share repurchase. The timing of when we may have a dividend increase David, is really all around the pace of acceleration, whether this pace of acceleration continues or whether it's different. I just think we need a little bit more time to feel comfortable, because the one thing you know, once we raise that dividend, we want to make sure that we're comfortable to keep it there. We're very comfortable with the $0.30, and we'll be looking at it literally every single month as we move forward. Sure, absolutely. So, interestingly, Fridays, and Saturdays we definitely were seeing in March that they were right around pre-pandemic levels. The shoulder days of Thursday and Sunday, were down a bit mid-single-digit compared to 2019. Monday through Wednesday, they were down more in the mid teens. So that's where you classically can see. What Tony talked about earlier is that some of the special corporate negotiated business you would classically think are the Monday through Wednesday nights, they are probably the last to come back in terms of comparison to 2019, but again, improving nicely as we moved from January to February to March. Yes, sure. So two things that I would say, a couple facts for you, just to give you perspective. I think again, we were really pleased with the IMFs in Q1. They were again, roughly 40% coming from the U.S. and Canada and frankly, that's only down so call that $40 million, that's only down from the high $50s millions in 2019, while RevPAR is obviously still down in the mid teens for those hotels in the U.S. So it's really impressive performance. In Q1 of 2019 56% of the U.S. hotels paid an IMF while in Q1 this year, we're at 12%. So to your point, there is a way to go and it obviously is they're much stronger in the luxury and resort hotels. It's a bit of a step function, where so many hotels have this jump from an owners priority in the U.S. to then where they actually earn that, there's not, I can't point to one particular kind of demarcation point that will tell you that we can jump. In the international it is much more aligned with what happens with base fees, because as you know, there with every dollar of profit we get a percentage with, without an owner's priority in many of the hotels. So in the U.S., obviously the big weakness right now is still on the occupancy side and that will help us particularly in the large cities as we continue to see gains in the premium hotels in the big cities. But there's unfortunately not one particular place that says if we get to ADR of whatever it is or RevPAR that that's going to clinch it. But again, one of the points that that I made during my comments, we're really pleased to see the margins being similar to 2019 levels and we're hopeful that that will continue for the rest of the year that we're able to hold on to this kind of margin performance for the full year for these manageable service hotels in the U.S. and that will obviously get us more IMF. If you remember, you can only recognize IMF as you look at your four year forecast. So that's one of the other things as we continue to move through the year, we'll have more visibility about the full year forecast for these hotels, which will also be helpful. Thank you. And Robin, it's worth noting that the rate for 2023 has improved relative to a quarter ago, when we look at the rate on the group pace for 2023. And as Tony said, we would continue to expect to see in the year for the year bookings. And on your question about loyalty, no meaningful impact. So, loyalty redemptions have been about 5% of our room nights pre-pandemic and are now. So they kind of fit in with the overall scheme of how those hotels are doing, depending on what market and what tier they are. So no particular impact that's any different from when we normally look at our RevPAR performance. And I'll turn it on the financial side is just a reminder that this is extremely small relative to kind of the overall size of Marriott from a financial standpoint, really across the spectrum of both investment as well as profitability. And from that perspective, I would expect to see it the same way moving forward. This has been a really important part of our overall ecosystem, and when we think about it, 90% of the bookings in HBMI  or from Bonvoy member, and that is just great recognition of the extra strength that it gives our overall system. But from an overall perspective to Marriott, I would not expect for you to see it be a meaningful part of our earnings stream in the near-term."

And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you Jackie and good morning everyone. Our team produced fantastic results in 2023. We continued to experience strong momentum in our business around the world thanks to solid demand for travel and our diverse portfolio of 30 plus leading brands. Full year of global RevPAR rose nearly 15% and net rooms grew 4.7% leading to excellent earnings and cash flow growth.  In the fourth quarter global RevPAR increased over 7% year-over-year driven by roughly equal gains in the ADR and occupancy. Group which comprised of 23% room nights was again the standout customer set. Compared to the year ago quarter Group revenues rose 9% globally and 7% in the U.S. and Canada. And Group is shaping up to have another solid year in 2024. At the end of last year, full year 2024 Group revenues were pacing up nearly 13% globally and 11% in the U.S. and Canada on a year-over-year basis, driven by robust increases in both room nights and ADR. Leisure transient accounted for 44% of global rooms nights in the quarter. This segment has by far grown the fastest coming out of COVID. With global leisure transient revenues in the fourth quarter, nearly 50% above the same quarter in 2019.  Even with this strong growth, demand has remained resilient. Fourth quarter global room nights rose 5% over the year ago quarter, leading to a 6% leisure transient revenue growth worldwide. In the U.S. and Canada, leisure revenues were up 2%. Business transient contributed 33% of global room nights in the fourth quarter. Demand from small and medium-sized corporates remained robust, and while large corporates are still lagging, they continue to post volume increases. Solid gains in ADR drove business transient revenues of 7% globally and 3% in the U.S. and Canada.  Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program grew to over 196 million members at the end of the year. Member penetration of global room nights reached new highs in the fourth quarter at 69% in the U.S. and Canada and 62% global. Our digital channels and mobile in particular remain key drivers of growth at a lower cost to our owners. Our Marriott Bonvoy app contributed 22% more room nights in 2023 than in the prior year. We are focused on improving the customer experience across all our digital and other booking channels through the multi-year technology transformation we have underway. Enhancing engagement with our members outside of hotel stays through our numerous successful Marriott Bonvoy collaborations, including our co-branded credit cards also remains a priority. Our growing portfolio of 31 credit cards across 11 countries had record global card member acquisitions last year, and card spend for the year grew 11%.  On the development front, despite a challenging financing environment in the U.S. and Europe, we signed a record 891 organic management, franchise, and license agreements in 2023, representing approximately 164,000 rooms. Additionally, we ended the year with a new high of roughly 573,000 rooms in our pipeline. We expect another year of strong global signings in 2024 and are already off to an incredible start. We also saw a meaningful acceleration in net rooms growth last year to 4.7%, the highest growth since 2019. Conversions helped again in 2023, accounting for 25% of organic room additions and 40% of organic room signings. For 2024, we anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. This includes around 37,000 rooms from MGM. The first set of these rooms at New York, New York became available on our Marriott channels at the end of January, with the remaining properties expected to be available by the middle of March. While it is very early days, we are incredibly pleased with the initial booking pace. We're excited about adding these amazing properties to our portfolio and enhancing our distribution in Las Vegas and other cities across the U.S.  We remain confident in the three-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at our investor meeting in September of 5% to 5.5% from year-end 2022 to year-end 2025. As we focus on expanding our lodging offerings for owners, franchisees, and guests, we're making significant progress globally in the high-growth, mid-scale space. We are in numerous deal discussions for Citi Express in the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA region, and for Four Points Express in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Here in the U.S. we celebrated the first groundbreaking for StudioRes in Fort Myers, Florida in January and have over 300 additional potential deals under discussion in around 150 markets. As we strive to offer more options for our stakeholders, we're also working on a new U.S. transient mid-scale brand for both new build and conversions. At the other end of the chain scale, our luxury distribution is currently over 50% larger than our next closest competitor and that lead is expanded. In 2023, we have record luxury signings with 58 new deals and we added 29 new luxury hotels to our portfolio.  In closing, 2023 was a banner year for Marriott, and I am optimistic about what lies ahead. The demand for all types of travel remains strong, even as the rebound impact from the pandemic has waned. The fundamentals for our industry are outstanding, and we are determined to grow our industry-leading position. We remain focused on offering the best brands and experiences to the most valuable and engaged guests while expanding the broadest and deepest portfolio of global properties and offerings so we can continue to connect people around the world through the power of travel. I want to thank our Marriott teams around the world for their remarkable dedication and excellent work. And now, let me turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. \nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. I'll walk you through our strong 2023 financial results. In the fourth quarter, U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased over 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ADR. International RevPAR rose 17%, driven by an 8 percentage point gain in occupancy and a 4% rise in ADR. Asia Pacific again experienced the largest year-over-year RevPAR increase. RevPAR rose 81% in Greater China helped by the last quarter of easy comparisons to COVID lockdowns in the year ago quarter and grew 13% in Asia Pacific, excluding China.  Fourth quarter total gross fee revenues grew 10% to 1.24 billion reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions, and strong growth in our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees or IMF rose 17%, reaching 218 million driven by another quarter of significant increases in Asia Pacific. For the full year, gross fees rose 18% with record IMFs that were nearly 20% higher than our prior peak in 2019. Owned lease and other revenue net of direct expenses reached 151 million in the quarter and included substantially higher termination fees, primarily due to 63 million associated with the termination of a development project.  G&A of 330 million was impacted by a $27 million litigation reserve for an international hotel, as well as timing of performance-related compensation, an increase in bad debt expense, and higher professional fees, which included costs associated with our intellectual property restructuring transactions. Fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 10% to nearly 1.2 billion. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was 21% higher than in 2022.  Thanks to our team's excellent tax planning efforts that reflect evolving global tax laws, we had a tax benefit of $267 million in the quarter. This was due to over $400 million of favorable discrete items related to international IP restructuring strategies and the release of a tax valuation allowance. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was slightly higher than last year's and above our previous expectations due to jurisdictional mixed shift. At the hotel level, despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation, we maintained profit margins in our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter and for the year compared to both 2022 and 2019, a strong performance.  Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend score achieved its highest monthly score in over five years. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash with almost $3.2 billion of cash provided by operating activities in 2023 of 34% year-over-year. Our loyalty program was a source of cash even after factoring in the final year of reduced payments from the credit card companies resulting from the amendments we entered into in 2020. In 2024, we expect loyalty cash flow to be roughly neutral.  Now let's talk more about 2024. Our full year outlook assumes a steady, albeit slower growing, global economy. It also reflects normalized lodging demand in most regions around the world, with Asia Pacific expected to see higher growth in other regions as it continues to have some benefit from COVID recovery, as well as additional international airlift. In 2024, RevPAR growth is expected to be driven by another meaningful increase in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient demand, which will be helped by mid-single-digit special corporate rate increases, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. We're off to a strong start with January RevPAR up 7% globally, reflecting continued strong demand around the world, potentially in international markets.  International RevPAR rose 14% and U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 4% in the month. With year-over-year comparisons easiest in January and Easter shifting from April to March this year, global RevPAR for the first quarter could increase 4% to 5%. For the full year, we anticipate a 3% to 5% rise in global RevPAR. Growth is expected to remain higher in international markets than in the U.S. and Canada, with particular strength in Asia Pacific. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around 50 million to 60 million of RevPAR related fees. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 8% to 5.1 billion to 5.2 billion with non-RevPAR related fees rising 9% to 10% driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth.  Owned, leased, and other revenues net of expenses are expected to total 320 million to 330 million, 17% to 20% lower than 2023 due to meaningfully lower termination fees given the large termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2023, a property we sold last summer, and CALA flipping from owned to managed, and renovations at several owned hotels. We expect 2024 G&A expense could be flat to up 2% year-over-year. There are a few discrete one-time items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 8% to roughly 4.9 billion to 5 billion. Note that our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be around 25% while we expect our underlying core cash tax rate to remain in the low 20% range.  Guidance details for the full year and first quarter are in the press release. Please note that first quarter results are expected to be impacted by a few items. First, the timing of residential branding fees is expected to result in these non-RevPAR related fees being meaningfully lower in the first quarter but up nicely for the full year. Second, owned lease and other revenue net of expenses will be lower due to the renovations on several owned properties, as well as the CALA property that flipped from owned to managed. And finally, G&A in the year-ago quarter benefited from several one-time items, while this year's first quarter includes MGM integration costs.  Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We're pleased with the significant value we return to shareholders in 2023 and expect strong capital returns again in 2024 [ph]. For 2024, factoring in the 500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand in Chicago, capital returns to shareholders could be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. Full year investment spending could total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time.  The $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CAPEX and $300 million elimination of previously reported guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly 200 million for our owned-leased portfolio and includes spending for the renovation and the elegant portfolios in Barbados, and the completion of the W Union Square renovations. We'll look to recycle these assets and sign long term management contracts after renovations are complete. As Tony mentioned, we're also thrilled about our development and growth prospects both inside and outside the U.S. We continue to gain market share with 7% open rooms, and 18% of rooms under construction globally, at the end of last year. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Now we'll take our first question from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Greff: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Leeny, I was hoping you can review the MGM transaction and what's included in fee contributions for this year? And then if you can maybe clarify what the integration costs that you refer to in your prepared comments related to the MGM license deal?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, sure. So it's really a modest amount of G&A but it's just worth noting in the year-over-year comparison in Q1, that as we expect all of those hotels to transition on to Marriott systems that will all be done in Q1. When we think about the same contribution, as we've talked about before, Joe, they will be coming on in Q1 and we expect that business to ramp up over the year. And there's not a particular number that I would give you now, but just a reflection that it is related to a percentage of the hotel revenue that fits into our franchise fee model as a result of a license agreement over the year.\nJoseph Greff: Great. And then I know you gave us some detail in terms of investment spend this year and that Sheraton Chicago is a big chunk of that. Is the 500 million all cash out the door, I know there's the 200 million in CAPEX and 300 million to, I guess satisfy the getting out of that guarantee. Can you provide a little bit more clarity on that? And then [Multiple Speakers] of the billion is sort of aspirational and not spoken for at this point? \nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, no, no, it's a good clarification question, Joe. That 500 million is cash out the door and we would expect that to occur in Q4 of 2024. But to help you understand what we're really considering capital investment, we wanted to clarify to say that 200 million of the 500 million relates to the purchase of the underlying land on the Sheraton Grand Chicago. And so that is in CAPEX, while the rest reflects a liability that we established on the balance sheets, frankly, years ago as part of the overall transaction. So it does obviously impact our available cash for the year, but it is in there. And when you think about unidentified capital expenditures in that number of the 1 to 1.2, which really is quite modest.\nJoseph Greff: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone. Tony and Leeny, just wondering -- if you could just start with maybe kind of current state of the development environment. Tony, obviously, global interest rates have cooperated a little bit for the hope of developers and just sort of what you're -- probably same thing on the construction cost landscape. So as we sit here today, I know it's only four months or so from your big update at the Analyst Day. But could you just give us latest sense of the land, how some of those conversations went, and what people should expect on the organic side for the first signings and more importantly, probably starting to move into construction?\nAnthony Capuano: Oh, of course. So, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks on the heels of a record signings year, it's more anecdotal than anything else. But in terms of deal volume through the first month of the year it's really encouraging. And we're seeing strong momentum both on submissions for new build projects around the world as well as continued really encouraging momentum on the conversion side. In terms of the environment coming out of the Alice, I'm going to ramble here a little bit, because I think there are both some positives and negatives that we heard from the owner and franchisee community about their expectations for 2024. On the positive side of the ledger, as you point out, there is a sense that there will be continued relief on the interest rate side as we get in particularly the back half of 2024. There is an expectation maybe in parallel, but the hotel transaction market will start to be a bit more active in the back half of the year as well. And while there is still admittedly some gap in the bid and the ask between sellers and buyers, it feels like that gap is continuing to narrow, which will likely lead we expect to a little more active transaction environment, which has always historically been good news for us on the conversion front.  When you pivot to the more challenging side of the ledger, you do still have lenders thinking about compliance with proposed regulatory environment that will perhaps impact their ability to really open the faucet in terms of the amount of debt to date and debt financing that they make available for new construction. But there again, it's one of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about our entry into midscale. When we talk to our franchise partners on the midscale front, they feel like the size of those commitments is something that they're going to have a decent measure of success in procuring debt.  And then the last thing I would remind you is the obvious debt, while we stayed very focused on the availability of debt and its impact on our growth trajectory, that is largely a U.S., Canada, and Western Europe attribute. When you look at the pace of growth we're seeing across Asia Pacific, across the Middle East, that growth does not seem to be particularly impacted by the ups and downs, the availability of debt.  I think you also had a question about construction costs and so maybe I'll expand my answer a little bit. When we think about potential impediments to growth, the availability of debt is the one that I think we're most focused on. Supply chain issues, which we were talking with you about a year ago, are not nearly as severe as we saw several quarters ago. Construction costs have come down a little bit and they're rising year-over-year at lower rates than we saw a year or two ago. So on that front, I think we're pretty encouraged. But it's really the ability to source debt for new construction is the area that Leeny and the team are most focused on.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSmedes Rose: I was just wondering, when we look at the sort of core metrics that you guys provide in terms of EBITDA for the year, unit growth and capital return, all of those at least relative to our forecast, are in line or better and look similar for consensus forecast. But your operating EPS outlook is quite a bit lower than consensus. And I was just wondering if there's any one or two things that you might point to that you think maybe there was a difference in sort of expectation versus what you expect to put up, because it doesn't sound like it's -- like a tax rate issue, maybe there's something else there?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. No, thanks Smedes very much. No, I appreciate that. Yes, tax rate is probably the biggest item when you think about it. First of all, just remember that in 2023 there is the reality of this extra termination fee. So when you look at year-over-year growth, that then impacts how you look at 2024 over 2023. And so if you adjust out for the odd balls of both the litigation reserve and the performance, the termination fee, and you take into consideration that we've got probably about a one point higher book tax rate, and I do emphasize it's a book tax rate rather than cash. Our cash tax rate is essentially staying the same, thanks to the great work that the team has done in working through our global tax planning. But when you look at it from a book perspective, it's about a point higher overall. And you put those together and you can do your math there, and that is where you then get to something that looks from an adjusted EPS that looks on 2024 that looks close to double digits.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, that's helpful. And then I was just wondering, Tony, you just mentioned in your opening remarks that some of the large corporate group bookings continued to lag, which is something we've kind of heard for a while relative to smaller groups. So I was just wondering, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what you're hearing and maybe expecting as we go forward, do you think that's just kind of impaired for the foreseeable future, or is it something that you think could improve over time, just maybe some more color there?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes, of course. So really, my comment was that, let me break it down into two buckets. When I talked about business transient, the small and medium sized corporates, the demand coming out of those groups continues to be quite robust. And my comment about large corporates lagging is really sort of in reference to a pre-pandemic environment. But with that said, we continue to see incremental growth even coming out of the large corporates quarter-over-quarter.\nLeeny Oberg: Just to be clear, that was on the transient side. On the group side, we're actually, as we talked about on the group pace, it's really still a very strong number. And I think to me, one of the interesting things is we're now getting back to some of the way it looked before where 75% of the group that is on -- that is -- that we're expecting in 2024, is already on the books, which if you look at that a year ago, that was only 65%. So it still really points out that, with this 11% pace that we're looking at for 2024 and 12% for 2025 in the U.S., that actually the corporate group as well as the other types of group is still quite strong.\nSmedes Rose: Great, thank you, appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is open. \nRichard Clarke: Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just one on the SG&A cost. You gave some color on why it was a little bit higher. But just wondering whether you can just do the bridge from the 255 guidance you gave at Q3. What wasn't anticipated there, was it this IP restructuring, and why did that suddenly happen in Q4, and maybe some color on the bad debt, is there anything to read across from that as well?\nLeeny Oberg: Right. So this is really largely about timing. We've taken you through the litigation reserve. And then there's obviously the usual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that reflect everything from closing deals and travel expense to, as you probably remember, when we go back to Q1 of 2023, we were still in the process of getting back to being fully staffed, which then ramps up during the year. And then as you know, the performance compensation -- performance-related compensation then takes into consideration how the company is doing against its targets. And you put all those together and the constant analysis of your positions of receivables from all of your hotels around the world and just really reflects some timing of when they fell in Q3 versus Q4. And there again, when you think about looking at next year, you do see that we're talking about flat to up 2%, which really reflects that there were a number of items this year.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, that makes sense. Maybe if I can just ask a follow-up. Just with the CMD you gave a RevPAR guidance for the two-year stack of 3 to 6, net unit growth guidance of 4 to 5. Obviously, both of those are going to have to accelerate into 2025 to kind of get to the midpoint. Is that what you're anticipating, that there are drivers to get RevPAR and acceleration in 2025?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes. So Richard, maybe I'll take the NAV question first. As we talked a little bit when we were together in Miami, we continue to think that, as you consider NAV it is less constructive to look at a single year and much more instructive to look at rooms growth over a multiyear period. In some ways, the MGM rooms coming into the system slipping from the back of 2023 into early 2024 is the best illustration of that. Notwithstanding MGM sliding into 2024, as you know, we ended up a little higher than anticipated in 2023 at 4.7% net unit growth. We expect to be at a meaningfully higher number this year because of the impact of the MGM openings. And when we look at the three-year CAGR that we discussed at the security analyst conference, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver that mid-single-digit range of about 5% to 5.5%. Then I think just on a more macro basis, we've not made any major changes in terms of our longer-term outlook. We obviously have a little more visibility and clarity into this year. Now that the teams around the world have gone through all their numbers, but we've really not revisited anything beyond 2024 and continue to be quite confident in what we talked about from a RevPAR perspective.\nLeeny Oberg: And just a reminder that when we go through the process, a lot of what we're trying to do at the security analyst meeting is to help you understand a range from a modeling perspective, and it's done before we go through the budgeting process. So actually, as you know, we ended up with a really strong year in 2023. And when we look at it overall from a growth in our hotel revenue system, we're right where we would have expected to be and very pleased about the demand that we're seeing both on the arc [ph] and rate side as we look into 2024.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. Thank you very much. \nAnthony Capuano: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nStephen Grambling: Right, good morning. I know you touched on the introductory remarks, but could you help us bridge the gap from thinking about room growth and RevPAR growth versus the gross management franchise fee growth, I mean, essentially, is this a mismatch that should continue beyond 2025 due to what you see in the pipeline or is it more to do with the MGM contribution and how that may ramp?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, definitely not from an MGM perspective. I think as we talked about the fundamental model still actually works very well. We had a couple of anomalies going on in 2023 but when you think about it broadly, the fundamental model of RevPAR plus fees continues to work fine. We've got the reality that, when you think about putting together the RevPAR scenario, you're getting benefit across the Board from the growth in the rooms as well as from IMF. And as you saw, we're talking about really strong continued IMF growth. And then, of course, the reflection that our non-RevPAR fees are expected to grow 9% to 10% in 2024. So I don't expect the fundamental kind of growth and fee algorithm to be different than we've talked about before.\nStephen Grambling: Great. And maybe one other quick follow-up to the last question, which was around the Investor Day in September. I guess just very, very big picture, what's changed from then to now as we think about that multiyear algorithm?\nLeeny Oberg: I would say very little, in terms of the basic equation. I mean, frankly, 2023 ended up being very strong. And if you think about the guidance that we gave, we ended up higher than the high end of what we gave in the Security Analyst Meeting by $6 million. So you are starting off with a higher base. And then again, we're looking, a lot of the numbers that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting were over a three-year time frame, and now we're being able to give you more specificity about 2024. But the fundamental about RevPAR growth plus net rooms growth, some operating leverage, continues to work. One thing I do think is interesting, when you look back at G&A as a percentage of fees, which being a fee-driven business, that is I think, the best relationship given the fluctuations in owned/leased as we sell hotels, and that is you look at 2019, we are in G&A as a percentage of gross fees around close to 25%. And the numbers that we've given you today show that number having dropped down to under 20%, which I think does show you the continued operating leverage that we're getting out of --.\nAnthony Capuano: And I might just build on that a little bit. And as for those of you that have been covering us for a long time, you know there's a phrase that guides almost everything we do. That phrase being success is never final. And while we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in the G&A ratio, you can rest assured that as a principal focus area for the senior leadership team, with an eye towards continuing to improve that efficiency.\nStephen Grambling: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question related to the RevPAR guidance, I guess, kind of looking at the chain scales. So based on how you report, I guess, premium, which some of us would consider upper upscale continues to be the strongest in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and that's kind of what we're seeing year-to-date. As you think about, I guess, luxury and upper upscale versus some of the other segments, do you have a view in terms of what will kind of lead 2024 and is there still a lot of room for ADR increases in upper upscale given what you're seeing with group pacing? Thank you. \nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So let me comment on a couple of things. First of all, when we think about special corporate rates, you've heard us talk about kind of continued building of that demand. And while it's not back to 2019 levels, it is continuing to at the margin grow a little bit faster. And we had high single-digit growth rate in that segment in 2023, and we're looking at strong mid-single-digit rate growth in that segment in 2024. So that is absolutely -- as you look at that, plus the group strength, which when I think about the group pace of that 11%, I would say, between rooms and ADR, that is probably two thirds, one third rooms and ADR. So you're still seeing some very nice growth there. So clearly, the premium segment is, I think, going to be the biggest beneficiary of that increase in demand. On the select service side, you saw that segment really come out of COVID the fastest and one that has moderated, as you've seen towards the end of this year. We would expect that to be Steady Eddy, but not really get the benefit of some of the things that I just mentioned. And then we continue to expect to see luxury continue to do really well. And so there is opportunity there, both on the rate and OCC side. But I think the two areas I mentioned before are probably the ones to highlight as you think about the tiers.\nAnthony Capuano: And I might build on that last luxury comment from Leeny. You heard in my opening remarks about the momentum we have in extending our lead and luxury from a footprint perspective. And fourth quarter 2023 versus fourth quarter 2022 on a global basis, we saw luxury RevPAR up 10%. And so we continue to see pretty compelling economics in the luxury segment and are excited about the growth we're seeing in terms of our industry-leading footprint.\nChad Beynon: Thank you, appreciate it. And then just a housekeeping, IMF at the end of the year, North American properties, what percentage were payers during the year maybe versus peak?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. This work gets a little complicated, but let's do it. And that is in 2023, for the full year would you like quarter or year, which do you prefer?\nChad Beynon: Yes, year unless the exit rate is massively different.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So 31% for the full year in U.S. and Canada versus 56%. However, there's really as you remember, there was a big change in our limited service portfolio as a result of the HPT Hotels leaving the system. So full-service hotels in 2023, 40% of our managed full service hotels were earning IMFs in the U.S., 45% at peak, really limited services, the big change of 19% in 2023 versus 66% in 2019. But many of those hotels are no longer in our system. Then when you look at international, it's really overwhelmingly quite similar as to when it was in 2019. So for the entire company, at 2023 68% are earning IMFs, versus 72%. And if you adjust for that limited service portfolio that I discussed, it was 70% in 2019. So we're really getting to quite similar levels. And as I said, international is really overwhelmingly the same as it was in 2019.\nChad Beynon: Great, thanks for all the details. Appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nBrandt Montour: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe for Tony. Just curious in terms of the development momentum going on in the ground in China today, what's sort of baked into the guidance in terms of China openings or maybe you could answer it qualitatively, has that market opening momentum changed now versus three or six months ago?\nAnthony Capuano: Yes. So we continue to see the momentum on the development side in China that we talked about a quarter or two ago, both in terms of what I would call intake, meaning the volume of MOUs that we're signing, the volume of new deals that we're improving. But just as compelling in terms of driving opening volume, during the pandemic we saw a variety of projects across the pipeline pause construction. And we're seeing the vast majority of those paused projects back under construction moving towards opening. So I think on early pipeline, if you will, approved and signed deals and under construction deals, we see encouraging trends in all three of those categories.\nBrandt Montour: Okay. That's encouraging. Go ahead.\nLeeny Oberg: I'd just add one thing that I think kind of helps frame your question, and that is when we look at our overall growth in rooms in Asia Pacific, we're in the high single digits, that we're looking at both in 2023 and 2024, including China and Asia Pacific outside of China. Just really strong demand for our brands across the various scales.\nBrandt Montour: Okay, thank you for that. And then just as a follow-up also on development, just a longer-term question, sort of thinking about reflecting back on 2023 as a year where capital formation and debt financing was harder to come by and that sort of weighed on U.S. new hotel starts. Is this -- do you think we'll be looking back on 2023 when we get to sort of 2025 or 2026 and be talking about something of an air pocket in terms of new hotel openings because of 2023 or do you think it's not as meaningful and there's other things that will offset, how do you think about that when you do your longer-term planning?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. No, I think you make a good point. As Tony talked about in his response to the question about the financing environment, there's no doubt that financing availability for new build construction of hotels is limited. And the strong brands get the most of it, but you've got some uncertainty around bank capital regulations, etcetera. So it is clearly down meaningfully from the kind of pace of new build that was in 2019. I think what you have seen on the goods side is that our conversions as a percentage of room signings has gone up meaningfully, and we look forward to that continuing. But yes, I hope that that is the case and that we're kind of seeing a bit of an air pocket in the U.S. as we talked about, outside the U.S., not as dependent. I will call out Europe, which also has a lot of the same characteristics as the U.S. on the new build construction side. But we are really pleased with what we're seeing on the StudioRes demand side and ability to start getting those shovels in the ground. And so there, we are hopeful that you'll start to see that pace pick up as the construction costs, the demand side continues to be very strong, as well as financing ability improves.\nAnthony Capuano: And I might just build on that comment about mid-scale. It's -- Leeny and I tend to climb over each other with enthusiasm to talk about mid-scale. We think there's a tremendous market opportunity from a demand perspective. There is a deep appetite from our franchise community. We think the cost of developing mid-scale will help our partners navigate what is still a challenging financing environment. And the other thing that is exciting to us, you'll recall the last number of quarters, in select service broadly, we talked about a lengthening of the construction cycle. Leeny and I were both down in Fort Myers putting a shovel in the ground for the first StudioRes. And our partners there talked about an expectation of opening that hotel in at most 13 months with an eye trying -- towards trying to get it open in 12 months. And so the ability to get mid-scale deals signed, shovels -- financed, shovels in the ground and open more quickly than what we've seen with a lot of other tiers in our portfolio, is another factor in our enthusiasm for our entry into midscale.\nBrandt Montour: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thank you so much. Given how well the MGM deal is starting off, as you think about your pipeline talks, what's the outlook for other large partnerships akin to the MGM deal going forward? Thanks. \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. So Leeny and I were both in Las Vegas this past weekend for Super Bowl, and so I'll make a couple of comments. Number one, when you look at the vibrancy of that market, you look at how effectively the city was able to accommodate an event like that. You likely heard the NFL Commissioner talking about how anxious the league is to get back to Las Vegas. I think both of us left the market really enthusiastic about what this partnership is going to offer our guests around the world and our Bonvoy members. In terms of your specific question, as we talked about when we announced the transaction, it is a creative opportunity for us where I think you will continue to see lots of activity for us is in traditional conversions, but in the category of multiunit conversions. You heard us a quarter ago talk about a terrific multiunit conversion in Vietnam with a partner called Vinpearl, and our teams around the world are actively working on a number of multiunit conversions. To the extent, a unique opportunity like MGM presents itself, I think we'll roll up our sleeves and see if we can make sense of it. We're really excited about what MGM does for Bonvoy and if those sorts of opportunities present themselves, we are certainly open to pursuing.\nKevin Kopelman: Great, very helpful. Thanks Tony.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Your line is now open. \nMichael Bellisario: Thanks, good morning everyone. Just on the capital allocation front, been a handful of reports, there's just a few smaller brands for sale, particularly domestically. Are you seeing any more interesting tuck-in M&A opportunities and does the math pencil any better or worse, especially relative to where your stock is trading today?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, some great questions. And as we have said for a long time, we've been very consistent in our message about really always being willing to entertain the way that we grow. We have grown very successfully, both in terms of tuck-in brand acquisitions as well as growing organic new brands, and growing that way around the world. We will continue to do that. We also are going to stay very price disciplined in terms of looking at both the price that you would be paying for the existing distribution as well as for the growth opportunities. We are really aware of looking at where something could add something unique to our portfolio, whether it is in a certain part of the world, as we did with the City Express deal, that really was a tremendous way for us to enter the mid-scale space in a really attractive market like Mexico, at an absolutely reasonable price. So I think in that regard, you got to look at all the elements. And what's out there, as you know, depends very much all the sellers' expectations of what they're looking for. I would say that, over time, we hope to see that those opportunities continue to be there and that we're going to remain as disciplined as we have before in looking at them.\nAnthony Capuano: I'll just build on Leeny's comment. I think this historical blend of considering acquisitions where we think they fill an opportunity in our brand architecture or accelerate our growth in a geography where we're not happy with our pace of organic growth, but also looking at the launch of organic platforms, is a strategy that has served us well and a strategy that will continue to guide our thinking about adding new platforms. It's interesting, I was looking at some numbers last night. Autograph, which was a platform in the soft brand space that we launched from scratch, between the open and pipeline, we have more than 400 hotels. And AC by Marriott, which was a platform that we acquired in Spain, that at time of acquisition I think, had 80 or 90 hotels, today between open and pipeline has nearly 400 hotels. And so there are a variety of strategies to add compelling platforms to the portfolio, and we'll continue to look at both.\nMichael Bellisario: Got it, that's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on midscale. What's the owner profile there look like, thinking about the mix of existing Marriott franchisees versus new owners, and would you expect that mix to be similar for the new brand? Thanks. \nLeeny Oberg: Yes, very similar. A great mix. Always welcoming new owners into our stable of owners and franchisees. But I would say, when I think about the StudioRes, some of the blend of what we're seeing in terms of the what I call the onesies and twosies where somebody is kind of in a particular market, been very successful and wants to build a hotel there, I would say many of them in the StudioRes space reflect multi-unit expectations on the part of partners of ours who we've been working with for a long time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning everyone. Okay, I apologize. I wanted to just drill a little bit deeper into the conversion discussion, if I may. Just looking at the percentage of your pipeline versus what we've seen elsewhere, if you could talk more about where those are coming from, what the strategies are, whether there's any change in the landscape geographies, whether there's a change in pricing, what's new with it, it's been such an important discussion for the past year or so among everyone, including yourselves?\nAnthony Capuano: Sure. So conversions have always been an important part of our growth story, in a climate where the debt markets for new construction are somewhat constricted, the importance of conversions is elevated. As we talked about in the opening, really compelling numbers in 2023 with 25% of our openings and 40% of our signings in the conversion category. They are coming in terms of type of project, pretty typical of what we've seen over the last number of years. A good mixture of conversions from other brands and with such a compelling stack of soft brands with Luxury Collection, Autograph, and Tribute. Lots of conversions coming from the world of independents as well. From a geographical perspective, not necessarily a shift in strategy, but we are seeing in, for instance, some of the Asia Pacific markets, which historically had been disproportionately new build, we are seeing some uptick in conversion activity. Our pursuit of conversion opportunities is quite deliberate, and it's resulting in deals like the one I mentioned earlier in Vietnam.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. \nPatrick Scholes: Hi, good morning everyone. I want to drill down a little bit on the credit card fees. It looks like you're expecting a big step-up in, if I understand it correctly, a step up in growth rate for 2024 which actually, I think you said 9% to 10%, which if I'm correct, is a little bit lower than the Investor Day of 12%. But specifically with that step up, are you expecting that from primarily new card sign-ups or more so from sort of same user spend? Thank you. \nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So first of all, I want to kind of be clear. The difference between the growth rates between 2023 and 2024 I would not expect to be very different across the credit cards. They grew 9% to 10% in 2023, and we would expect them to do fairly similarly in 2024. That is overwhelmingly a function of increase in the number of cardholders. As you've heard us talk about, we've been really successful in adding credit cards in a number of countries. We really expanded that program quite a bit and in some of the markets, I'll point out Japan as an example, we've just seen really wonderful acceptance of the Bonvoy credit card. So in that respect, I'd say the growth that we would expect in those fees comes overwhelmingly from additional -- having additional cardholders. And then overall, a really very small amount related to a typical cardholder spend. Now when I look at overall non-RevPAR fees, I think that's where it gets a little bit interesting, because you were dealing with things like residential where you see residential branding fees tied to when those units open for occupancy. So they're quite lumpy. So as I explained in Q1, we expect them to be meaningfully lower in Q1 than Q1 in 2023, while for the full year, we actually are seeing that business do very well. And we expect year-over-year to see fantastic growth in branding fees overall for the year in 2024 over 2023. So when you look overall at the non-RevPAR fees, we're excited about to see them continue to grow at these roughly double-digit sorts of numbers for another year.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is now open.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks for taking the question. Circling back to the unit growth, and I know you've given a lot of great color around it. Just looking at the kind of two-year CAGR you've given at the Investor Day, excluding MGM when the timing of that wasn't quite known, so it's kind of implying that 2024 and 2025 would be up, excluding MGM, in the kind of 4% to 5% range. And I think the 2024 guide today, ex MGM, is up in the kind of 3% to 4% range. So maybe expecting an acceleration to 5% to 6% growth next year. And just wondering, I know you talked about the likelihood that conversions will be a higher percent of that. You also recently announced a franchise agreement in China that the timing wasn't entirely clear. It was kind of potentially over the next three years it could be adding, I don't know if it would be like 50 basis points a year. I guess I wonder if you could tell us whether that franchising agreement, how much of that you expect to be driving the acceleration next year, just kind of help put some color around the acceleration? Thank you. \nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So let me -- I'm going to do the last question first, and then, at some point, Tony, feel free to jump in to add more color. But let's first talk about Delemex [ph], which we're really excited about our relationship there, where there is a terrific large hospitality company in China, and we're looking forward to having the opportunity to convert a number of hotels. And we actually didn't give a time frame. So it would just be as part of our normal growth in China and as we look at our overall rooms growth, so there's not a particular kind of specific sort of 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points associated with the conversion of a number of those hotels into tributes. We are again really excited about working with them on the opportunity, but it's just part of our overall rooms growth. As I said, the signings that we're seeing in Greater China are very encouraging both in 2023 and as we move into 2024. That's really in addition to what you're talking to about the Delemex [ph] deal and that is where I talked about the rooms growth in Asia in the high single digits, which again is just a great reflection of the desire for our brands. When you ask about the basic CAGR for rooms growth relative to the Security Analyst Meeting that we made in September, I think you really have to kind of go back to what Tony said in his earlier comment, is that these deals can be lumpy, whether it's City Express, whether it's MGM, whether it's a large conversion deal that we do. And so you really need to think about the numbers that we gave that were 5% to 5.5% for the three-year CAGR, which we continue to be really confident and excited about. We ended up a little bit higher on our net rooms growth in 2023 than the 4.2 to 4.5 range that we gave. And that's really a reflection of the steady strong demand for our brands. So that then when we look at the MGM and the continuation of turning these rooms from our pipeline into openings, we actually see it as being essentially the same as where we were back at the SAM [ph]. And then again, you have to kind of be looking at it not solely within the context of one year.\nAnthony Capuano: And Robin, I think the only other question embedded was about conversion volume. And we mentioned in the open that our openings in 2023 were about 25% conversions. Even if you look at 2024 expected openings ex MGM, we expect some acceleration to about 30% of those openings being conversions. And when you think about 40% of our signings last year being in the conversion category, that's logical.\nOperator: And we have reached our allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tony for any additional or closing remarks.\nAnthony Capuano: Well, as always, thank you again for your interest in Marriott. We are coming off a terrific year in 2023. Tremendously enthusiastic about 2024 or what 2024 holds. And we look forward to seeing all of you on the road. Safe travels.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Anthony Capuano",
            "content": "Thank you Jackie and good morning everyone. Our team produced fantastic results in 2023. We continued to experience strong momentum in our business around the world thanks to solid demand for travel and our diverse portfolio of 30 plus leading brands. Full year of global RevPAR rose nearly 15% and net rooms grew 4.7% leading to excellent earnings and cash flow growth.  In the fourth quarter global RevPAR increased over 7% year-over-year driven by roughly equal gains in the ADR and occupancy. Group which comprised of 23% room nights was again the standout customer set. Compared to the year ago quarter Group revenues rose 9% globally and 7% in the U.S. and Canada. And Group is shaping up to have another solid year in 2024. At the end of last year, full year 2024 Group revenues were pacing up nearly 13% globally and 11% in the U.S. and Canada on a year-over-year basis, driven by robust increases in both room nights and ADR. Leisure transient accounted for 44% of global rooms nights in the quarter. This segment has by far grown the fastest coming out of COVID. With global leisure transient revenues in the fourth quarter, nearly 50% above the same quarter in 2019.  Even with this strong growth, demand has remained resilient. Fourth quarter global room nights rose 5% over the year ago quarter, leading to a 6% leisure transient revenue growth worldwide. In the U.S. and Canada, leisure revenues were up 2%. Business transient contributed 33% of global room nights in the fourth quarter. Demand from small and medium-sized corporates remained robust, and while large corporates are still lagging, they continue to post volume increases. Solid gains in ADR drove business transient revenues of 7% globally and 3% in the U.S. and Canada.  Our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program grew to over 196 million members at the end of the year. Member penetration of global room nights reached new highs in the fourth quarter at 69% in the U.S. and Canada and 62% global. Our digital channels and mobile in particular remain key drivers of growth at a lower cost to our owners. Our Marriott Bonvoy app contributed 22% more room nights in 2023 than in the prior year. We are focused on improving the customer experience across all our digital and other booking channels through the multi-year technology transformation we have underway. Enhancing engagement with our members outside of hotel stays through our numerous successful Marriott Bonvoy collaborations, including our co-branded credit cards also remains a priority. Our growing portfolio of 31 credit cards across 11 countries had record global card member acquisitions last year, and card spend for the year grew 11%.  On the development front, despite a challenging financing environment in the U.S. and Europe, we signed a record 891 organic management, franchise, and license agreements in 2023, representing approximately 164,000 rooms. Additionally, we ended the year with a new high of roughly 573,000 rooms in our pipeline. We expect another year of strong global signings in 2024 and are already off to an incredible start. We also saw a meaningful acceleration in net rooms growth last year to 4.7%, the highest growth since 2019. Conversions helped again in 2023, accounting for 25% of organic room additions and 40% of organic room signings. For 2024, we anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. This includes around 37,000 rooms from MGM. The first set of these rooms at New York, New York became available on our Marriott channels at the end of January, with the remaining properties expected to be available by the middle of March. While it is very early days, we are incredibly pleased with the initial booking pace. We're excited about adding these amazing properties to our portfolio and enhancing our distribution in Las Vegas and other cities across the U.S.  We remain confident in the three-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at our investor meeting in September of 5% to 5.5% from year-end 2022 to year-end 2025. As we focus on expanding our lodging offerings for owners, franchisees, and guests, we're making significant progress globally in the high-growth, mid-scale space. We are in numerous deal discussions for Citi Express in the Caribbean and Latin America, or CALA region, and for Four Points Express in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  Here in the U.S. we celebrated the first groundbreaking for StudioRes in Fort Myers, Florida in January and have over 300 additional potential deals under discussion in around 150 markets. As we strive to offer more options for our stakeholders, we're also working on a new U.S. transient mid-scale brand for both new build and conversions. At the other end of the chain scale, our luxury distribution is currently over 50% larger than our next closest competitor and that lead is expanded. In 2023, we have record luxury signings with 58 new deals and we added 29 new luxury hotels to our portfolio.  In closing, 2023 was a banner year for Marriott, and I am optimistic about what lies ahead. The demand for all types of travel remains strong, even as the rebound impact from the pandemic has waned. The fundamentals for our industry are outstanding, and we are determined to grow our industry-leading position. We remain focused on offering the best brands and experiences to the most valuable and engaged guests while expanding the broadest and deepest portfolio of global properties and offerings so we can continue to connect people around the world through the power of travel. I want to thank our Marriott teams around the world for their remarkable dedication and excellent work. And now, let me turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Oh, of course. So, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks on the heels of a record signings year, it's more anecdotal than anything else. But in terms of deal volume through the first month of the year it's really encouraging. And we're seeing strong momentum both on submissions for new build projects around the world as well as continued really encouraging momentum on the conversion side. In terms of the environment coming out of the Alice, I'm going to ramble here a little bit, because I think there are both some positives and negatives that we heard from the owner and franchisee community about their expectations for 2024. On the positive side of the ledger, as you point out, there is a sense that there will be continued relief on the interest rate side as we get in particularly the back half of 2024. There is an expectation maybe in parallel, but the hotel transaction market will start to be a bit more active in the back half of the year as well. And while there is still admittedly some gap in the bid and the ask between sellers and buyers, it feels like that gap is continuing to narrow, which will likely lead we expect to a little more active transaction environment, which has always historically been good news for us on the conversion front.  When you pivot to the more challenging side of the ledger, you do still have lenders thinking about compliance with proposed regulatory environment that will perhaps impact their ability to really open the faucet in terms of the amount of debt to date and debt financing that they make available for new construction. But there again, it's one of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about our entry into midscale. When we talk to our franchise partners on the midscale front, they feel like the size of those commitments is something that they're going to have a decent measure of success in procuring debt.  And then the last thing I would remind you is the obvious debt, while we stayed very focused on the availability of debt and its impact on our growth trajectory, that is largely a U.S., Canada, and Western Europe attribute. When you look at the pace of growth we're seeing across Asia Pacific, across the Middle East, that growth does not seem to be particularly impacted by the ups and downs, the availability of debt.  I think you also had a question about construction costs and so maybe I'll expand my answer a little bit. When we think about potential impediments to growth, the availability of debt is the one that I think we're most focused on. Supply chain issues, which we were talking with you about a year ago, are not nearly as severe as we saw several quarters ago. Construction costs have come down a little bit and they're rising year-over-year at lower rates than we saw a year or two ago. So on that front, I think we're pretty encouraged. But it's really the ability to source debt for new construction is the area that Leeny and the team are most focused on. Yes, of course. So really, my comment was that, let me break it down into two buckets. When I talked about business transient, the small and medium sized corporates, the demand coming out of those groups continues to be quite robust. And my comment about large corporates lagging is really sort of in reference to a pre-pandemic environment. But with that said, we continue to see incremental growth even coming out of the large corporates quarter-over-quarter. Yes. So Richard, maybe I'll take the NAV question first. As we talked a little bit when we were together in Miami, we continue to think that, as you consider NAV it is less constructive to look at a single year and much more instructive to look at rooms growth over a multiyear period. In some ways, the MGM rooms coming into the system slipping from the back of 2023 into early 2024 is the best illustration of that. Notwithstanding MGM sliding into 2024, as you know, we ended up a little higher than anticipated in 2023 at 4.7% net unit growth. We expect to be at a meaningfully higher number this year because of the impact of the MGM openings. And when we look at the three-year CAGR that we discussed at the security analyst conference, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver that mid-single-digit range of about 5% to 5.5%. Then I think just on a more macro basis, we've not made any major changes in terms of our longer-term outlook. We obviously have a little more visibility and clarity into this year. Now that the teams around the world have gone through all their numbers, but we've really not revisited anything beyond 2024 and continue to be quite confident in what we talked about from a RevPAR perspective. Thank you. And I might just build on that a little bit. And as for those of you that have been covering us for a long time, you know there's a phrase that guides almost everything we do. That phrase being success is never final. And while we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in the G&A ratio, you can rest assured that as a principal focus area for the senior leadership team, with an eye towards continuing to improve that efficiency. And I might build on that last luxury comment from Leeny. You heard in my opening remarks about the momentum we have in extending our lead and luxury from a footprint perspective. And fourth quarter 2023 versus fourth quarter 2022 on a global basis, we saw luxury RevPAR up 10%. And so we continue to see pretty compelling economics in the luxury segment and are excited about the growth we're seeing in terms of our industry-leading footprint. Yes. So we continue to see the momentum on the development side in China that we talked about a quarter or two ago, both in terms of what I would call intake, meaning the volume of MOUs that we're signing, the volume of new deals that we're improving. But just as compelling in terms of driving opening volume, during the pandemic we saw a variety of projects across the pipeline pause construction. And we're seeing the vast majority of those paused projects back under construction moving towards opening. So I think on early pipeline, if you will, approved and signed deals and under construction deals, we see encouraging trends in all three of those categories. And I might just build on that comment about mid-scale. It's -- Leeny and I tend to climb over each other with enthusiasm to talk about mid-scale. We think there's a tremendous market opportunity from a demand perspective. There is a deep appetite from our franchise community. We think the cost of developing mid-scale will help our partners navigate what is still a challenging financing environment. And the other thing that is exciting to us, you'll recall the last number of quarters, in select service broadly, we talked about a lengthening of the construction cycle. Leeny and I were both down in Fort Myers putting a shovel in the ground for the first StudioRes. And our partners there talked about an expectation of opening that hotel in at most 13 months with an eye trying -- towards trying to get it open in 12 months. And so the ability to get mid-scale deals signed, shovels -- financed, shovels in the ground and open more quickly than what we've seen with a lot of other tiers in our portfolio, is another factor in our enthusiasm for our entry into midscale. Yes. So Leeny and I were both in Las Vegas this past weekend for Super Bowl, and so I'll make a couple of comments. Number one, when you look at the vibrancy of that market, you look at how effectively the city was able to accommodate an event like that. You likely heard the NFL Commissioner talking about how anxious the league is to get back to Las Vegas. I think both of us left the market really enthusiastic about what this partnership is going to offer our guests around the world and our Bonvoy members. In terms of your specific question, as we talked about when we announced the transaction, it is a creative opportunity for us where I think you will continue to see lots of activity for us is in traditional conversions, but in the category of multiunit conversions. You heard us a quarter ago talk about a terrific multiunit conversion in Vietnam with a partner called Vinpearl, and our teams around the world are actively working on a number of multiunit conversions. To the extent, a unique opportunity like MGM presents itself, I think we'll roll up our sleeves and see if we can make sense of it. We're really excited about what MGM does for Bonvoy and if those sorts of opportunities present themselves, we are certainly open to pursuing. I'll just build on Leeny's comment. I think this historical blend of considering acquisitions where we think they fill an opportunity in our brand architecture or accelerate our growth in a geography where we're not happy with our pace of organic growth, but also looking at the launch of organic platforms, is a strategy that has served us well and a strategy that will continue to guide our thinking about adding new platforms. It's interesting, I was looking at some numbers last night. Autograph, which was a platform in the soft brand space that we launched from scratch, between the open and pipeline, we have more than 400 hotels. And AC by Marriott, which was a platform that we acquired in Spain, that at time of acquisition I think, had 80 or 90 hotels, today between open and pipeline has nearly 400 hotels. And so there are a variety of strategies to add compelling platforms to the portfolio, and we'll continue to look at both. Sure. So conversions have always been an important part of our growth story, in a climate where the debt markets for new construction are somewhat constricted, the importance of conversions is elevated. As we talked about in the opening, really compelling numbers in 2023 with 25% of our openings and 40% of our signings in the conversion category. They are coming in terms of type of project, pretty typical of what we've seen over the last number of years. A good mixture of conversions from other brands and with such a compelling stack of soft brands with Luxury Collection, Autograph, and Tribute. Lots of conversions coming from the world of independents as well. From a geographical perspective, not necessarily a shift in strategy, but we are seeing in, for instance, some of the Asia Pacific markets, which historically had been disproportionately new build, we are seeing some uptick in conversion activity. Our pursuit of conversion opportunities is quite deliberate, and it's resulting in deals like the one I mentioned earlier in Vietnam. And Robin, I think the only other question embedded was about conversion volume. And we mentioned in the open that our openings in 2023 were about 25% conversions. Even if you look at 2024 expected openings ex MGM, we expect some acceleration to about 30% of those openings being conversions. And when you think about 40% of our signings last year being in the conversion category, that's logical. Well, as always, thank you again for your interest in Marriott. We are coming off a terrific year in 2023. Tremendously enthusiastic about 2024 or what 2024 holds. And we look forward to seeing all of you on the road. Safe travels."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. I'll walk you through our strong 2023 financial results. In the fourth quarter, U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased over 3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher ADR. International RevPAR rose 17%, driven by an 8 percentage point gain in occupancy and a 4% rise in ADR. Asia Pacific again experienced the largest year-over-year RevPAR increase. RevPAR rose 81% in Greater China helped by the last quarter of easy comparisons to COVID lockdowns in the year ago quarter and grew 13% in Asia Pacific, excluding China.  Fourth quarter total gross fee revenues grew 10% to 1.24 billion reflecting higher RevPAR, room additions, and strong growth in our co-brand credit card fees. Incentive management fees or IMF rose 17%, reaching 218 million driven by another quarter of significant increases in Asia Pacific. For the full year, gross fees rose 18% with record IMFs that were nearly 20% higher than our prior peak in 2019. Owned lease and other revenue net of direct expenses reached 151 million in the quarter and included substantially higher termination fees, primarily due to 63 million associated with the termination of a development project.  G&A of 330 million was impacted by a $27 million litigation reserve for an international hotel, as well as timing of performance-related compensation, an increase in bad debt expense, and higher professional fees, which included costs associated with our intellectual property restructuring transactions. Fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 10% to nearly 1.2 billion. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was 21% higher than in 2022.  Thanks to our team's excellent tax planning efforts that reflect evolving global tax laws, we had a tax benefit of $267 million in the quarter. This was due to over $400 million of favorable discrete items related to international IP restructuring strategies and the release of a tax valuation allowance. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was slightly higher than last year's and above our previous expectations due to jurisdictional mixed shift. At the hotel level, despite meaningful wage and benefit inflation, we maintained profit margins in our U.S. managed hotels in the quarter and for the year compared to both 2022 and 2019, a strong performance.  Importantly, our guest surveys indicate that customer satisfaction continues to rise. In December, our intent to recommend score achieved its highest monthly score in over five years. Our asset-light business model once again generated significant cash with almost $3.2 billion of cash provided by operating activities in 2023 of 34% year-over-year. Our loyalty program was a source of cash even after factoring in the final year of reduced payments from the credit card companies resulting from the amendments we entered into in 2020. In 2024, we expect loyalty cash flow to be roughly neutral.  Now let's talk more about 2024. Our full year outlook assumes a steady, albeit slower growing, global economy. It also reflects normalized lodging demand in most regions around the world, with Asia Pacific expected to see higher growth in other regions as it continues to have some benefit from COVID recovery, as well as additional international airlift. In 2024, RevPAR growth is expected to be driven by another meaningful increase in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient demand, which will be helped by mid-single-digit special corporate rate increases, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. We're off to a strong start with January RevPAR up 7% globally, reflecting continued strong demand around the world, potentially in international markets.  International RevPAR rose 14% and U.S. and Canada RevPAR increased 4% in the month. With year-over-year comparisons easiest in January and Easter shifting from April to March this year, global RevPAR for the first quarter could increase 4% to 5%. For the full year, we anticipate a 3% to 5% rise in global RevPAR. Growth is expected to remain higher in international markets than in the U.S. and Canada, with particular strength in Asia Pacific. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around 50 million to 60 million of RevPAR related fees. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 8% to 5.1 billion to 5.2 billion with non-RevPAR related fees rising 9% to 10% driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth.  Owned, leased, and other revenues net of expenses are expected to total 320 million to 330 million, 17% to 20% lower than 2023 due to meaningfully lower termination fees given the large termination fee in the fourth quarter of 2023, a property we sold last summer, and CALA flipping from owned to managed, and renovations at several owned hotels. We expect 2024 G&A expense could be flat to up 2% year-over-year. There are a few discrete one-time items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 5% and 8% to roughly 4.9 billion to 5 billion. Note that our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be around 25% while we expect our underlying core cash tax rate to remain in the low 20% range.  Guidance details for the full year and first quarter are in the press release. Please note that first quarter results are expected to be impacted by a few items. First, the timing of residential branding fees is expected to result in these non-RevPAR related fees being meaningfully lower in the first quarter but up nicely for the full year. Second, owned lease and other revenue net of expenses will be lower due to the renovations on several owned properties, as well as the CALA property that flipped from owned to managed. And finally, G&A in the year-ago quarter benefited from several one-time items, while this year's first quarter includes MGM integration costs.  Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. We're pleased with the significant value we return to shareholders in 2023 and expect strong capital returns again in 2024 [ph]. For 2024, factoring in the 500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand in Chicago, capital returns to shareholders could be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. Full year investment spending could total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time.  The $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CAPEX and $300 million elimination of previously reported guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly 200 million for our owned-leased portfolio and includes spending for the renovation and the elegant portfolios in Barbados, and the completion of the W Union Square renovations. We'll look to recycle these assets and sign long term management contracts after renovations are complete. As Tony mentioned, we're also thrilled about our development and growth prospects both inside and outside the U.S. We continue to gain market share with 7% open rooms, and 18% of rooms under construction globally, at the end of last year. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator. Yeah, sure. So it's really a modest amount of G&A but it's just worth noting in the year-over-year comparison in Q1, that as we expect all of those hotels to transition on to Marriott systems that will all be done in Q1. When we think about the same contribution, as we've talked about before, Joe, they will be coming on in Q1 and we expect that business to ramp up over the year. And there's not a particular number that I would give you now, but just a reflection that it is related to a percentage of the hotel revenue that fits into our franchise fee model as a result of a license agreement over the year. Yeah, no, no, it's a good clarification question, Joe. That 500 million is cash out the door and we would expect that to occur in Q4 of 2024. But to help you understand what we're really considering capital investment, we wanted to clarify to say that 200 million of the 500 million relates to the purchase of the underlying land on the Sheraton Grand Chicago. And so that is in CAPEX, while the rest reflects a liability that we established on the balance sheets, frankly, years ago as part of the overall transaction. So it does obviously impact our available cash for the year, but it is in there. And when you think about unidentified capital expenditures in that number of the 1 to 1.2, which really is quite modest. Yes. No, thanks Smedes very much. No, I appreciate that. Yes, tax rate is probably the biggest item when you think about it. First of all, just remember that in 2023 there is the reality of this extra termination fee. So when you look at year-over-year growth, that then impacts how you look at 2024 over 2023. And so if you adjust out for the odd balls of both the litigation reserve and the performance, the termination fee, and you take into consideration that we've got probably about a one point higher book tax rate, and I do emphasize it's a book tax rate rather than cash. Our cash tax rate is essentially staying the same, thanks to the great work that the team has done in working through our global tax planning. But when you look at it from a book perspective, it's about a point higher overall. And you put those together and you can do your math there, and that is where you then get to something that looks from an adjusted EPS that looks on 2024 that looks close to double digits. Just to be clear, that was on the transient side. On the group side, we're actually, as we talked about on the group pace, it's really still a very strong number. And I think to me, one of the interesting things is we're now getting back to some of the way it looked before where 75% of the group that is on -- that is -- that we're expecting in 2024, is already on the books, which if you look at that a year ago, that was only 65%. So it still really points out that, with this 11% pace that we're looking at for 2024 and 12% for 2025 in the U.S., that actually the corporate group as well as the other types of group is still quite strong. Right. So this is really largely about timing. We've taken you through the litigation reserve. And then there's obviously the usual quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that reflect everything from closing deals and travel expense to, as you probably remember, when we go back to Q1 of 2023, we were still in the process of getting back to being fully staffed, which then ramps up during the year. And then as you know, the performance compensation -- performance-related compensation then takes into consideration how the company is doing against its targets. And you put all those together and the constant analysis of your positions of receivables from all of your hotels around the world and just really reflects some timing of when they fell in Q3 versus Q4. And there again, when you think about looking at next year, you do see that we're talking about flat to up 2%, which really reflects that there were a number of items this year. And just a reminder that when we go through the process, a lot of what we're trying to do at the security analyst meeting is to help you understand a range from a modeling perspective, and it's done before we go through the budgeting process. So actually, as you know, we ended up with a really strong year in 2023. And when we look at it overall from a growth in our hotel revenue system, we're right where we would have expected to be and very pleased about the demand that we're seeing both on the arc [ph] and rate side as we look into 2024. Yes, definitely not from an MGM perspective. I think as we talked about the fundamental model still actually works very well. We had a couple of anomalies going on in 2023 but when you think about it broadly, the fundamental model of RevPAR plus fees continues to work fine. We've got the reality that, when you think about putting together the RevPAR scenario, you're getting benefit across the Board from the growth in the rooms as well as from IMF. And as you saw, we're talking about really strong continued IMF growth. And then, of course, the reflection that our non-RevPAR fees are expected to grow 9% to 10% in 2024. So I don't expect the fundamental kind of growth and fee algorithm to be different than we've talked about before. I would say very little, in terms of the basic equation. I mean, frankly, 2023 ended up being very strong. And if you think about the guidance that we gave, we ended up higher than the high end of what we gave in the Security Analyst Meeting by $6 million. So you are starting off with a higher base. And then again, we're looking, a lot of the numbers that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting were over a three-year time frame, and now we're being able to give you more specificity about 2024. But the fundamental about RevPAR growth plus net rooms growth, some operating leverage, continues to work. One thing I do think is interesting, when you look back at G&A as a percentage of fees, which being a fee-driven business, that is I think, the best relationship given the fluctuations in owned/leased as we sell hotels, and that is you look at 2019, we are in G&A as a percentage of gross fees around close to 25%. And the numbers that we've given you today show that number having dropped down to under 20%, which I think does show you the continued operating leverage that we're getting out of --. Sure. So let me comment on a couple of things. First of all, when we think about special corporate rates, you've heard us talk about kind of continued building of that demand. And while it's not back to 2019 levels, it is continuing to at the margin grow a little bit faster. And we had high single-digit growth rate in that segment in 2023, and we're looking at strong mid-single-digit rate growth in that segment in 2024. So that is absolutely -- as you look at that, plus the group strength, which when I think about the group pace of that 11%, I would say, between rooms and ADR, that is probably two thirds, one third rooms and ADR. So you're still seeing some very nice growth there. So clearly, the premium segment is, I think, going to be the biggest beneficiary of that increase in demand. On the select service side, you saw that segment really come out of COVID the fastest and one that has moderated, as you've seen towards the end of this year. We would expect that to be Steady Eddy, but not really get the benefit of some of the things that I just mentioned. And then we continue to expect to see luxury continue to do really well. And so there is opportunity there, both on the rate and OCC side. But I think the two areas I mentioned before are probably the ones to highlight as you think about the tiers. Yes, sure. This work gets a little complicated, but let's do it. And that is in 2023, for the full year would you like quarter or year, which do you prefer? Yes. So 31% for the full year in U.S. and Canada versus 56%. However, there's really as you remember, there was a big change in our limited service portfolio as a result of the HPT Hotels leaving the system. So full-service hotels in 2023, 40% of our managed full service hotels were earning IMFs in the U.S., 45% at peak, really limited services, the big change of 19% in 2023 versus 66% in 2019. But many of those hotels are no longer in our system. Then when you look at international, it's really overwhelmingly quite similar as to when it was in 2019. So for the entire company, at 2023 68% are earning IMFs, versus 72%. And if you adjust for that limited service portfolio that I discussed, it was 70% in 2019. So we're really getting to quite similar levels. And as I said, international is really overwhelmingly the same as it was in 2019. I'd just add one thing that I think kind of helps frame your question, and that is when we look at our overall growth in rooms in Asia Pacific, we're in the high single digits, that we're looking at both in 2023 and 2024, including China and Asia Pacific outside of China. Just really strong demand for our brands across the various scales. Yes. No, I think you make a good point. As Tony talked about in his response to the question about the financing environment, there's no doubt that financing availability for new build construction of hotels is limited. And the strong brands get the most of it, but you've got some uncertainty around bank capital regulations, etcetera. So it is clearly down meaningfully from the kind of pace of new build that was in 2019. I think what you have seen on the goods side is that our conversions as a percentage of room signings has gone up meaningfully, and we look forward to that continuing. But yes, I hope that that is the case and that we're kind of seeing a bit of an air pocket in the U.S. as we talked about, outside the U.S., not as dependent. I will call out Europe, which also has a lot of the same characteristics as the U.S. on the new build construction side. But we are really pleased with what we're seeing on the StudioRes demand side and ability to start getting those shovels in the ground. And so there, we are hopeful that you'll start to see that pace pick up as the construction costs, the demand side continues to be very strong, as well as financing ability improves. Well, some great questions. And as we have said for a long time, we've been very consistent in our message about really always being willing to entertain the way that we grow. We have grown very successfully, both in terms of tuck-in brand acquisitions as well as growing organic new brands, and growing that way around the world. We will continue to do that. We also are going to stay very price disciplined in terms of looking at both the price that you would be paying for the existing distribution as well as for the growth opportunities. We are really aware of looking at where something could add something unique to our portfolio, whether it is in a certain part of the world, as we did with the City Express deal, that really was a tremendous way for us to enter the mid-scale space in a really attractive market like Mexico, at an absolutely reasonable price. So I think in that regard, you got to look at all the elements. And what's out there, as you know, depends very much all the sellers' expectations of what they're looking for. I would say that, over time, we hope to see that those opportunities continue to be there and that we're going to remain as disciplined as we have before in looking at them. Yes, very similar. A great mix. Always welcoming new owners into our stable of owners and franchisees. But I would say, when I think about the StudioRes, some of the blend of what we're seeing in terms of the what I call the onesies and twosies where somebody is kind of in a particular market, been very successful and wants to build a hotel there, I would say many of them in the StudioRes space reflect multi-unit expectations on the part of partners of ours who we've been working with for a long time. Sure. So first of all, I want to kind of be clear. The difference between the growth rates between 2023 and 2024 I would not expect to be very different across the credit cards. They grew 9% to 10% in 2023, and we would expect them to do fairly similarly in 2024. That is overwhelmingly a function of increase in the number of cardholders. As you've heard us talk about, we've been really successful in adding credit cards in a number of countries. We really expanded that program quite a bit and in some of the markets, I'll point out Japan as an example, we've just seen really wonderful acceptance of the Bonvoy credit card. So in that respect, I'd say the growth that we would expect in those fees comes overwhelmingly from additional -- having additional cardholders. And then overall, a really very small amount related to a typical cardholder spend. Now when I look at overall non-RevPAR fees, I think that's where it gets a little bit interesting, because you were dealing with things like residential where you see residential branding fees tied to when those units open for occupancy. So they're quite lumpy. So as I explained in Q1, we expect them to be meaningfully lower in Q1 than Q1 in 2023, while for the full year, we actually are seeing that business do very well. And we expect year-over-year to see fantastic growth in branding fees overall for the year in 2024 over 2023. So when you look overall at the non-RevPAR fees, we're excited about to see them continue to grow at these roughly double-digit sorts of numbers for another year. Sure. So let me -- I'm going to do the last question first, and then, at some point, Tony, feel free to jump in to add more color. But let's first talk about Delemex [ph], which we're really excited about our relationship there, where there is a terrific large hospitality company in China, and we're looking forward to having the opportunity to convert a number of hotels. And we actually didn't give a time frame. So it would just be as part of our normal growth in China and as we look at our overall rooms growth, so there's not a particular kind of specific sort of 10, 20, 30, 40 basis points associated with the conversion of a number of those hotels into tributes. We are again really excited about working with them on the opportunity, but it's just part of our overall rooms growth. As I said, the signings that we're seeing in Greater China are very encouraging both in 2023 and as we move into 2024. That's really in addition to what you're talking to about the Delemex [ph] deal and that is where I talked about the rooms growth in Asia in the high single digits, which again is just a great reflection of the desire for our brands. When you ask about the basic CAGR for rooms growth relative to the Security Analyst Meeting that we made in September, I think you really have to kind of go back to what Tony said in his earlier comment, is that these deals can be lumpy, whether it's City Express, whether it's MGM, whether it's a large conversion deal that we do. And so you really need to think about the numbers that we gave that were 5% to 5.5% for the three-year CAGR, which we continue to be really confident and excited about. We ended up a little bit higher on our net rooms growth in 2023 than the 4.2 to 4.5 range that we gave. And that's really a reflection of the steady strong demand for our brands. So that then when we look at the MGM and the continuation of turning these rooms from our pipeline into openings, we actually see it as being essentially the same as where we were back at the SAM [ph]. And then again, you have to kind of be looking at it not solely within the context of one year."

And now, I will turn the call over to Tony.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We recorded terrific third quarter results this morning. Global demand for travel has remained strong and worldwide RevPAR of the quarter rose 9% versus 2022. RevPAR increased over 4% in the US and Canada and 22% internationally, driven by significant gains across Asia Pacific. Robust RevPAR growth, combined with nearly 5% year-over-year rooms growth, resulted in adjusted EPS of $2.11, up 25% from 2022. The third quarter tends to see a seasonally higher level of leisure transient travel, which accounted for 45% of global room nights during the quarter, about 4 percentage points above the first half. Globally, demand in this segment was, again, quite strong, with room nights up 7% over the 2022 third quarter, leading to 9% leisure transient revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 4% from the year ago quarter, even as many domestic guests traveled to international locations, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. In the third quarter, leisure room nights from US and Canadian guests traveling outside the region were up nearly 25% over the last year when cross-border travel was still constrained by COVID-related restrictions. Business transient demand accounted for 32% of global room nights in the quarter, while certain industries like technology and finance saw nice sequential improvement in demand during the quarter. The overall growth per segment remained slow and steady, with business transient revenues rising 4% versus 2022 in the US and Canada. Global group room night-share stood at 23% in third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, group revenues rose 9% globally and 5% in the US and Canada. The performance of group coming out of the pandemic has been remarkable, and the segment is expected to continue to be a meaningful driver of revenue growth going forward. In the US and Canada, fourth quarter 2023 group revenues were pacing up 12% year-over-year at the end of September, leading to full year group revenue pacing up 19%. Of course, we have the most visibility in the group, given the longer booking windows. We're very pleased that as of the end of the third quarter, US and Canada group revenue on the books for 2024 were pacing up 14% versus 2023, driven by a 9% rise in room nights and a 5% increase in average rates. Cross-border travel continued to strengthen, helping drive RevPAR growth in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, again, saw the most meaningful quarterly increase in international visitors, aided by global events like the Women's World Cup and improved airlift. The percent of global room nights from cross-border guests was about 1 percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. The most upside is still expected to come in Asia Pacific as international airlift to China improves. International airlift in Greater China was roughly 50% of 2019 capacity at the end of the third quarter and is expected to improve to around 60% by the end of the year. Turning to our powerful Bonvoy loyalty program. We remain focused on driving membership and fostering engagement with our 192 million members. Through our multi-year company-wide digital and technology transformation, we are increasingly leveraging the power of our more modern platform to create more seamless, engaging digital experiences for our members. Adoption of our Marriott Bonvoy mobile app, which has become the channel of choice for the majority of our lead members, continues to grow, with third-quarter app downloads increasing 19% versus the same quarter last year. We also continue to drive engagements for our Bonvoy collaborations, including Uber, Eat Around Town and our co-branded credit cards, which are currently in 11 countries. We're very excited about the opportunities our Bonvoy customers will receive from our MGM strategic licensing arrangement, which is now expected to launch in early 2024. As we think about our net rooms growth, full year 2023 growth is now expected to be 4.2% to 4.5%, higher than our previous expectation, excluding the additional 37,000 MGMs. The MGM timing shift does not impact the three-year net rooms growth CAGR of 5% to 5.5% through 2025, that we lay down in our financial model at our September Analyst Day. We are pleased that over the next few years, our net rooms growth is anticipated to be squarely in the mid-single digit range. During the quarter our pipeline reached a new record high of nearly 557,000 rooms, a record even excluding the MGM rooms. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multi-unit opportunities. Conversions represented 20% of signings and nearly 30% of openings in the quarter. As we outlined in our Analyst Day, we are very excited about the global opportunity for mid-scale. We have real momentum with the Citi Express brand in CALA, Four Points Express in Europe, and StudioRes in the US, with terrific interest across the development community. We already have 10 signed letters of intent for City Express in CALA, nine of which are in new countries for the brand, four signed deals for Four Points Express in Turkey and in London. And we're in numerous additional discussions for both brands. And while we just recently issued the franchise disclosure documents for StudioRes, we are already in talks for deals in over 300 markets across the US. We expect there will be shovels in the ground for StudioRes projects in the next few months. As a global company, we are keenly aware that we are living in a time of highly geopolitical tension. We are heartbroken by the devastating loss of so many innocent lives in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by this tragic war, as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine, and we remain hopeful for peace. I will now turn the call over to Lee to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid momentum in our business around the world and came in ahead of our expectations. As Tony noted, worldwide RevPAR grew 9% above the top end of our guidance, led by meaningful gains in Asia Pacific. Global occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, 3 percentage points higher than a year ago, and global ADR continued to rise, growing 4%. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.2 billion, in line with our guidance and 13% above the prior year quarter. Fees would have been higher given our RevPAR performance, but for the negative impact of the wildfires in Maui, which primarily affected our IMFs. Total IMFs still grew meaningfully, rising 35% to $143 million in the quarter. International IMFs rose nearly 60% benefiting from another quarter of significant RevPAR increases in Asia Pacific. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees grew 8% to $208 million, boosted by another strong quarter for our co-brand credit cards, partially offset by lower residential branding fees. Co-brand credit fees rose 11% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of robust global card spend and new card acquisition. Our owned lease and other revenue, net of direct expenses reached $70 million in the quarter, given continued improved performance at our owned and leased hotel. With the operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA rose 16% to $1.14 billion. After another quarter of meaningful share buybacks, diluted adjusted EPS grew 25% year-over-year to $2.11. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. And our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In the first nine months of this year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Over the last seven years, which included two years of no share repurchases as a result of COVID, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 23%, while at the same time investing meaningfully in innovation and growth. Now, let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. While there is heightened geopolitical risk and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, the consumer is still generally holding up well and our forward bookings through the end of the year in most regions around the world remain solid. We're raising our full-year RevPAR guidance to incorporate the better than anticipated third quarter results, as well as higher expectations for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we've seen a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. We now anticipate fourth quarter RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% in the US and Canada, and 14% to 16% internationally. This would lead to global RevPAR growth of 6% to 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 14% to 15% for the full year. We now expect full year total gross fee revenues could rise 17% to 18% with fourth quarter gross fees benefiting a bit from the higher RevPAR expectation. This is expected to be partially offset by lower expected residential branding fees due to anticipated completion of certain projects slipping into next year, as well as a bit softer results in Israel and surrounding countries. We've started to see some cancellations and softer demand for our five hotels in Israel, as well as for the 27 hotels in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. Fees for these four countries made up less than 1% of total company gross fees in full year 2022. We've not seen a meaningful impact on demand in the rest of the Middle East. We're keeping a close eye on the situation and working closely with our teams from the ground as events unfold. Total non- RevPAR related fees are expected to increase around 5% for the full year, benefiting from credit card fees rising roughly 10%, thanks to robust growth and average spend in the number of cardholders, partially offset by meaningfully lower residential branding fees this year versus our peak levels in 2022. Residential fees are tied to the sales of new units and tend to be lumpy as projects enter sales and closing spaces. Owned, leased and other net is now expected to be around $330 million for the full year, at the low end of our previous guidance range, primarily due to the restructuring of an existing lease on a hotel in New York that recently flipped to franchise. We expect 2023 G&A expenses to be around $935 million at the high end of our prior range, primarily due to higher compensation and legal expenses and to a lesser extent MGM integration costs. Compared to 2022, full-year adjusted EBITDA could increase 19% to 20% and adjusted EPS could rise 27% to 28%. We expect to return between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders for the full year 2023. This now assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $950 million, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. As we've discussed, with our major technology transformation, technology spending will be elevated this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. As we look into 2024, we continue to be enthusiastic about healthy global lodging demand for our brands and our strong pipeline growth. While we are still in the middle of putting together our property budgets for 2024, we believe the modeled global RevPAR range for 2024 of 3% to 6% we discussed at September Security Analyst Meeting is appropriate. Thank you for your interest in Marriott. Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Tony or Leeny, just wanted to maybe start with the development side. Obviously, the pipeline number was very strong. It did look like the in-construction number, I think, slipped very modestly quarter-on-quarter. So could you maybe help, first of all, just comment, big picture, Tony, on what you're seeing on the development side, particularly in the US. And then secondarily, just any comments on how we should expect maybe that in-construction portion to evolve just as, again, the development environment kind of levels off here a little bit. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Sure, Sean, I'll try to talk maybe macro and then I might ask Leeny to chime in with some perspective on the financing climate, particularly here in the US and maybe some perspective on Europe, because those tend to be the two markets where our development partners rely most heavily on, conventional debt financing and the markets where we're seeing the most constriction in the availability of financing for new construction. With that said, the ebb and flow of under-construction is both good and bad, right? As hotels open and we had a good quarter of openings. You see under-construction hotels leave the pipeline, because they enter the system that\u2019s opening hotels, and that's good news for us. We have talked over the last couple of quarters about, albeit a steady increase in the number of construction starts, which is good news for us, but that constriction in the debt markets that I talked about, precluding us from getting back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of the pace of new construction starts, particularly here in the US. At the same time, we are encouraged by the continued increase in the pace of conversion activity, both on individual conversions and portfolio conversions. And I think it's that increased pace, coupled with a steady improvement in construction starts that gives us confidence in reaffirming the multi-year net unit growth numbers we shared with you last month during the Security Analyst Conference. And maybe with that, I'll ask Leeny to just give a little more color on the financing environment.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. So there is couple of comments overall, Shaun. One is, just a reminder that the under-construction component of our pipeline also very typically includes conversions that may be going through some element of renovation before they open. And so, it's not quite the same as pre-COVID, which had a lower percentage of conversions for the company overall. So, as we've talked about before, we would expect, for example, perhaps roughly 30% of the openings in 2024 to be from conversions, which means, they can be in the pipeline a bit differently than the classic new build timing for being in the pipeline. So I think that the nature of the under construction pipeline could be perhaps a little bit different than pre-COVID. But as Tony was describing, you've clearly got the reality that in Asia Pacific and a number of other markets, there is meaningfully less dependence on the debt markets. And those markets are seeing much more stereotypical signings and progress into rooms under construction. While in the US, what you see is that, there is clearly still an open financing market for strong brands, strong market locations, demonstrated developer success. And in those, we are absolutely continuing to see that the financing is happening and that the rooms are getting under construction. The main difference, I would say is, they're taking a bit longer to actually get under construction. But as we kind of look going forward, the ones that are getting under construction are moving forward and then opening right on time. So as Tony said, overall, we're pleased to see the net rooms growth, for example, that we actually raised a bit for 2023, reflecting continued strong demand for our brands and also rooms getting finished and open, as well as really strong signings going into the pipeline. So overall, we're actually quite pleased on the new rooms front.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And Joe, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.\nJackie McConagha: Are you on mute, Joe? All right, let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Yes, we'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Hey there, can you hear me?\nTony Capuano: Yes, good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Grambling: Good morning. I would love if you could put a little bit more meat on the bone for the 2024 RevPAR commentary, specifically if you can give any color on how you are thinking through North America versus other regions? And how these assumptions may impact incentive management fees or other fees in the next year? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. Thanks very much. As I mentioned in my comments, we continue to feel good about the 3% to 6% range that we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting. It's worth noting, however, Stephen, that we are smack in the middle of the process of building the budgets at the hotel level and moving up. So we're not prepared to give kind of formal guidance at this point. But when we look, broadly speaking, at seeing continued demand for travel, and as we talk about in the US, we would expect that that will remain in this more normalized seasonal patterns that we've now come to see. You've seen our guidance for Q4 being 3% to 4%, which reflects that. But we've got some basic strong fundamentals. Low supply growth for several years, which looks to continue to be the way going into 2024, and that's reflected in our higher percentage of conversions. And we do expect to see another year of strong growth in our special corporate rate on top of very strong growth in that rate in 2023. As we talked about in seeing our group pace, which is up 14%, that's actually got strong both rooms growth, as well as strong rate growth in the US, which does also bode well for continued sustainability in ADR. And I'll probably throw in one extra, which is that, in luxury, you probably remember we talked about that having in Q2, RevPAR was down ever so slightly in our luxury US and Canada properties just down by 1% in Q2, but that actually moved positive again in Q3 and was actually up 2%. So, I put all those together and, of course, this does depend greatly on the overall macroeconomic conditions and we will need to see where that goes. But given what we look at right now, we continue to feel good about the fundamentals.\nStephen Grambling: Helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Given those comments you've made with sort of like a kind of a peak into 2024. I just wanted to ask you about maybe how we should think about capital return? Is it fair to assume that you would try to reach at least level seen in this year and maybe more, given cash flow and the average level still remain below longer-term targets?\nLeeny Oberg: I think at this stage of the game, since we're really working through all of the budget work and kind of looking at investment spending, et cetera, again, the broad guidelines that we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting remain consistent. You will remember that we talked about an expectation of having the Sheraton Grand Chicago put to Marriott in 2024, which will be a use of cash we would expect at the end of 2024, and that was on top of the investment spending levels that were more normalized. But I think the philosophy, Smedes, remains exactly the same, which is, to say we do like where we are in terms of our credit ratios being at the lower end of our adjusted debt to adjusted [EBITDAR] (ph) and would expect to remain in that territory given the various kind of uncertainties that are out there. But other than that, the basic equation that you have seen us use for quite a number of years, I would expect to be similar, which would then result in substantial amounts of capital being returned to our shareholders.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question early. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask something a bit more strategic because there's been so much noise around the lower end chain scales and the competitive landscape there, and the competition for conversions, and the launch of new brands, etc, that we've all heard. I'd love to talk about your strategy and where you are focusing more of your resources competitively. And is that just based on the assets that you have, is that strategic thought? Where are you putting more of your attention into your growth?\nTony Capuano: Yes, great question. Maybe the way I would answer that is, I like to describe those discussions as ever being binary. We don't look at it and say, let's pivot our focus away from our luxury leadership, for instance, towards focus on midscale. They are not mutually exclusive. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are very excited about the early returns of the focused resources we've put against our entry into mid-scale, the fact that we're already seeing letters of intent signed for Citi Express, even in almost 10 new countries. Then we've got signed deals very early in the launch of Four Points Express. Then we've got hundreds of identified markets for StudioRes, almost as the ink is drying on the FDD here in the US. And so that's extraordinarily exciting for us. But that does not require us to hit the pause button on extending our lead in the very valuable luxury segment. And so, that's a long-winded way of saying our strategy is to continue to strengthen our leadership position in luxury and upper upscale, while expanding our growth potential in a new segment for us, which is midscale. And so, as we roll out midscale, you've got products like City Express, which I think at least initially will be largely new build. I think the same is true for StudioRes. On the other hand you look at a platform like Four Points Express, we think there are extraordinary opportunities to roll out conversions under that platform. And as we mentioned during the analyst presentation, we will continue to look at every market we operate in and determine is there an opportunity for mid-scale? And if so, is it a new build opportunity, a virgin opportunity or both.\nDavid Katz: Thank you. Am I permitted to follow up? I would ask about the midscale stuff just to be clear that you're not finding -- you're not finding that you have to do more either in hard and soft cost in order to capture deals there and the competition level is not intensifying meaningfully or noticeably there at all, right?\nTony Capuano: No. I mean, obviously it's early, but what I will tell you is, we have a pretty extraordinary group of franchise partners who are brimming with excitement about our entry into this tier. And we're engaged with them on every continent talking about opportunities for midscale. So we don't find ourselves from a deal term perspective or a capital participation perspective doing anything out of the ordinary.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you all so much.\nTony Capuano: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about unit growth next year, and I know you're not giving specific guidance yet. But if we used the CAGR when you thought MGM was going to be in 2023, it kind of implied that each of the next two years would be in the 4% to 5% range. So with MGM kind of shifting into 2024, is it -- would something then in that sort of 6% to 7.5% range, right, just kind of adding MGM into 4% to 5%. Is that the range we should think about for unit growth next year? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So thanks, Robin. As we talked about in our comments and at the Security Analyst Meeting, I think when you've got a deal like MGM or City Express, things can be a little lumpy in terms of the specific year-over-year rooms growth. And so, I do think it's much more important to be looking more broadly at the two to three year CAGR sort of numbers. And there clearly with the 2.4% higher room count as a result of MGM, that's obviously going to help 2024's number a lot. And you saw that our 2023 number came down, although it actually went up apart from MGM compared to a quarter ago. So I think the main thing I would focus on is that, we continue to feel really good about the 5% to 5.5% net rooms growth over the 2022 through 2025 time period. And we will obviously, as we get to full budget details, when we get to February, we'll be more specific. But I think, again, the basic earnings equation and growth model of the company is exactly as we described in September at the Security Analyst Meeting.\nRobin Farley: Okay. I guess so it sounds like you're saying your expectations for unit growth outside of MGM for next year have not changed, right? Is that the conclusion?\nLeeny Oberg: Again, as I described, we have talked about continuing to feel very confident about the three-year 5% to 5.5% and are pleased to see the 2023 number move up a quarter of a point compared to a quarter ago. But we are in the middle of that process as we speak and we'll be able to be more specific when we get to February.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just firstly on the incentive management fees, it looks like in the North American market, down to just 23%, those look like those are down year-on-year. Is that all down to this [Hawaii] (ph) effect? Maybe you can just clarify exactly what that effect was or is there some other discretion in there about how much you've accrued for the quarter? And if I can add a little follow-up, I just want to know if the MGM delay has had any impact on anything other than the NUG guidance? Has that impact your EBITDA guidance for Q4 as well?\nLeeny Oberg: You're a little muddied on the actual call. So -- on some of your words. So, let me try to see what I can do with what you asked. On -- let's just talk, broadly speaking on IMFs, which is to say that, overall for the company we are up meaningfully in US And Canada year-to-date Q3, $194 million compared to $167 million -- sorry, to $221 million for the full year in 2022. So I would say we're going to end up higher and meaningfully higher than in 2019. And we were impacted as we talked about from the Maui fires in our IMFs by close to $10 million, which obviously are going to impact our IMF. So when I think about the percentage of hotels that are earning incentive fees in the US and Canada, we had, let's see, year-to-date, US and Canada is 31%, and that compares to year to date in 2022 of 26%. And so I think from that standpoint, we're really pleased with the margin work that's been done in the US and frankly around the world. The only other thing I'll point out is that, IMS for the year at $537 million year-to-date are higher than IMS for the full year in 2022 already, just through three quarters. So again, the margins there I think show really well. Was there a second question?\nTony Capuano: Yes. And then Richard, I think on your second question, if I heard it right, the way you ought to think about the brief delay of the integration of MGM is the way you described it, if I can hear you clearly, which is, that's principally an impact on the timing of the NUG impact, the impact on fees, or EBITDA if that was your question, is de minimis.\nRichard Clarke: That was my question. Thanks very much for clarifying.\nTony Capuano: You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of the group booking trends, I believe you said 9% for 2024 in terms of the number of rooms. We're still trying to get a sense if some of the current and future bookings are deferred or catch up, or if this is becoming kind of the new norm, kind of the foundational level. So any color in terms of multi-year bookings, maybe into 2025, or if you've been able to kind of crack that code if this is the new base level of group? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: So I'll talk about a couple stats and then Tony may want to add anything kind of from a more broad perspective. Just one thing that's worth noting is that, group is back to being about the same percentage of our business that it was pre-COVID. So very squarely, almost a quarter of the business is related to groups. So I think you are seeing it normalizing there. And the numbers that we've talked about in US and Canada of 14%, that's obviously on a business that is really settled down into more normal seasonal pattern rather than still having lots of revenge travel. I think one of the interesting things is there, while some of the special corporate business has not returned in exactly the same form that it was pre-COVID, I think there is also the reality that companies are recognizing the value of getting together and are doing it in groups, maybe not in quite the same way they were doing some business transient. So, when you look at the overall proportion of the business, it is really leisure and business transient that was swapped a little bit, while group remains quite consistent to the way it was pre-COVID.\nTony Capuano: And maybe the only other color I would add, while it doesn't speak to 2025. In my opening remarks I talked about group revenue growth in the quarter both globally and for the US and Canada, and as Leeny and I have been traveling around the world. I mean, one of the things that's really encouraging is this continued forward booking strength we're seeing in group is not simply a US and Canada phenomenon. We're seeing strong group pick up around the world.\nChad Beynon: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Thank you. Good morning. I just want to dig into group a little bit more. Could you maybe pull out corporate group meetings and incentive travel? And are you seeing the same strengths there? Is there any change maybe in the booking window that reflects some more of the layoff announcements that we've seen recently more broadly? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: No particular trends of notice relative to kind of your point about more kind of some trends in companies. We do have longer group booking windows overall, which reflect the fact that people are finding that the hotels are full and that they need to get their groups on the books. So that part remains consistent. I would not say that we see any kind of notable difference between leisure group and business group, either kind of in the past several months or frankly over the last several years, there is a steady diet of both of those.\nMichael Bellisario: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBill Crow: Good morning. Thanks. Tony, there's a difference between normalization in leisure demand and the consumer weakening? And I guess given your broad scope across price points and globally, where are you seeing the consumer weaken?\nTony Capuano: Well, on a macro basis, the consumer continues -- we continue to see fairly consistent strength in the consumer. We've seen a little bit of trade down. We obviously compete across price points. But as Leeny pointed out in response to one of the earlier questions, in the third quarter we saw some strength in rate in the luxury tier, which suggests that maybe that's an ebb and flow as opposed to a multi-quarter trend. We do think there is a value-driven consumer that perhaps we were not capturing before, which is one of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about entering the mid-scale tier for the first time. We think that's a segment of the traveling public that perhaps we had been priced out of capturing fully in the past. But beyond that, we continue to see strength really across the consumer. The one thing that's going to be really interesting to watch, I think, I've mentioned in my opening remarks, there were within a percentage point of getting back to pre-pandemic levels of cross-border travel. And you'll recall, we had lots of good conversations back and forth in 2019 about emerging middle classes in markets around the world and their appetite for cross-border travel, much of the recovery we've seen in international markets has been on the shoulders of domestic demand. And as international airlift recovers, one of the things we're watching closely is how strong is that middle class consumer and how strong has their appetite for cross-border travel recovered. I realize that's a bit of a rambling answer, but I mean, we're watching the strengths of the consumer around the world. And most of what we're seeing is either encouraging or wait and see, and I think wait and see applies to that cross-border question, but the early returns are encouraging.\nLeeny Oberg: The only thing I would add is that, if this trend around experiences versus goods, which we continue to see a really positive element of demand. So whether it is for music concerts or professional sports games or for youth athletics or all of those pieces of people's lives, that continues to be a great driver of demand for travel and really is quite global. So again, kind of a realization on the part of people that travel is a fundamental part of life and one that is very much appreciated.\nTony Capuano: And, Bill, just to build on that point, as we talk to our credit card partners, who obviously have rich consumer spending data, the trend that Leeny just described was much more prevalent in the younger generations pre-pandemic. When you look at current credit card spending data, it appears that that's a trend that really spans generations now, which is obviously great news for our business.\nBill Crow: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. I just wanted to talk a little bit about your expectation for a recovery in large managed corporate. You talked about solid gains in lagging industries in the third quarter. Just curious on how your long-term expectation has changed on large manage? I realize that small and medium has been quite strong, but is a full recovery in large manage still possible at this point? Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Yes. So we've had a version of this conversation in the past. It often starts with a question, do you think business travel is permanently impaired? And I'll give you a version of the answer I've given in the past, which is, I absolutely don't think travel is permanently impaired. I just think it's going to look a little different. The small and medium, we've talked about [indiscernible] that has been recovered now for a number of quarters and continues to show strength. There are a number of factors that are impacting some of the big corporates, whether that be concerns they have about macroeconomic conditions, whether that be sustainability goals that they set for themselves. Whatever it might be, it is having some impact on the pace at which their travel volumes recover. But we're seeing offsets to that impact on the strengths that you heard Leeny describe in group. We're also seeing offsets in the amount of blended travel that's driving, for instance, the extraordinary recovery we saw on Sundays and Thursdays. And so, I think that the day of the week looks a little different, the segments look a little different, but the overall volumes are quite encouraging.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meredith Jensen with HSBC.\nMeredith Jensen: Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about partnerships like Rappi? And if that kind of collaboration might be a model for additional partnerships that we'll see going forward? And any color you could give to that and how that might compare to others? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yes, great question. The short answer is I hope so. Bonvoy is such an extraordinarily powerful platform for us, it\u2019s a platform that strengthens the connectivity to our guests, ties together the breadth of our brand portfolio and partnerships like Rappi give us greater stickiness with the platform and allow us to connect more deeply in, in the case of Rappi, in markets like Latin America. They have to make sense for both sides to be obvious, but Bonvoy gives us a terrific opportunity to explore, create, and take advantage of those sorts of partnerships. And so, we will absolutely continue to look for those sorts of opportunities.\nMeredith Jensen: Great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we have no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony Capuano to close this out. Please go ahead.\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you again for all your interest and great questions this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in Marriott and look forward to seeing you on the road. Have a great afternoon.\nOperator: This does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We recorded terrific third quarter results this morning. Global demand for travel has remained strong and worldwide RevPAR of the quarter rose 9% versus 2022. RevPAR increased over 4% in the US and Canada and 22% internationally, driven by significant gains across Asia Pacific. Robust RevPAR growth, combined with nearly 5% year-over-year rooms growth, resulted in adjusted EPS of $2.11, up 25% from 2022. The third quarter tends to see a seasonally higher level of leisure transient travel, which accounted for 45% of global room nights during the quarter, about 4 percentage points above the first half. Globally, demand in this segment was, again, quite strong, with room nights up 7% over the 2022 third quarter, leading to 9% leisure transient revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 4% from the year ago quarter, even as many domestic guests traveled to international locations, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific. In the third quarter, leisure room nights from US and Canadian guests traveling outside the region were up nearly 25% over the last year when cross-border travel was still constrained by COVID-related restrictions. Business transient demand accounted for 32% of global room nights in the quarter, while certain industries like technology and finance saw nice sequential improvement in demand during the quarter. The overall growth per segment remained slow and steady, with business transient revenues rising 4% versus 2022 in the US and Canada. Global group room night-share stood at 23% in third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, group revenues rose 9% globally and 5% in the US and Canada. The performance of group coming out of the pandemic has been remarkable, and the segment is expected to continue to be a meaningful driver of revenue growth going forward. In the US and Canada, fourth quarter 2023 group revenues were pacing up 12% year-over-year at the end of September, leading to full year group revenue pacing up 19%. Of course, we have the most visibility in the group, given the longer booking windows. We're very pleased that as of the end of the third quarter, US and Canada group revenue on the books for 2024 were pacing up 14% versus 2023, driven by a 9% rise in room nights and a 5% increase in average rates. Cross-border travel continued to strengthen, helping drive RevPAR growth in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, again, saw the most meaningful quarterly increase in international visitors, aided by global events like the Women's World Cup and improved airlift. The percent of global room nights from cross-border guests was about 1 percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. The most upside is still expected to come in Asia Pacific as international airlift to China improves. International airlift in Greater China was roughly 50% of 2019 capacity at the end of the third quarter and is expected to improve to around 60% by the end of the year. Turning to our powerful Bonvoy loyalty program. We remain focused on driving membership and fostering engagement with our 192 million members. Through our multi-year company-wide digital and technology transformation, we are increasingly leveraging the power of our more modern platform to create more seamless, engaging digital experiences for our members. Adoption of our Marriott Bonvoy mobile app, which has become the channel of choice for the majority of our lead members, continues to grow, with third-quarter app downloads increasing 19% versus the same quarter last year. We also continue to drive engagements for our Bonvoy collaborations, including Uber, Eat Around Town and our co-branded credit cards, which are currently in 11 countries. We're very excited about the opportunities our Bonvoy customers will receive from our MGM strategic licensing arrangement, which is now expected to launch in early 2024. As we think about our net rooms growth, full year 2023 growth is now expected to be 4.2% to 4.5%, higher than our previous expectation, excluding the additional 37,000 MGMs. The MGM timing shift does not impact the three-year net rooms growth CAGR of 5% to 5.5% through 2025, that we lay down in our financial model at our September Analyst Day. We are pleased that over the next few years, our net rooms growth is anticipated to be squarely in the mid-single digit range. During the quarter our pipeline reached a new record high of nearly 557,000 rooms, a record even excluding the MGM rooms. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multi-unit opportunities. Conversions represented 20% of signings and nearly 30% of openings in the quarter. As we outlined in our Analyst Day, we are very excited about the global opportunity for mid-scale. We have real momentum with the Citi Express brand in CALA, Four Points Express in Europe, and StudioRes in the US, with terrific interest across the development community. We already have 10 signed letters of intent for City Express in CALA, nine of which are in new countries for the brand, four signed deals for Four Points Express in Turkey and in London. And we're in numerous additional discussions for both brands. And while we just recently issued the franchise disclosure documents for StudioRes, we are already in talks for deals in over 300 markets across the US. We expect there will be shovels in the ground for StudioRes projects in the next few months. As a global company, we are keenly aware that we are living in a time of highly geopolitical tension. We are heartbroken by the devastating loss of so many innocent lives in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted by this tragic war, as well as the ongoing war in Ukraine, and we remain hopeful for peace. I will now turn the call over to Lee to discuss our financial results in more detail. Sure, Sean, I'll try to talk maybe macro and then I might ask Leeny to chime in with some perspective on the financing climate, particularly here in the US and maybe some perspective on Europe, because those tend to be the two markets where our development partners rely most heavily on, conventional debt financing and the markets where we're seeing the most constriction in the availability of financing for new construction. With that said, the ebb and flow of under-construction is both good and bad, right? As hotels open and we had a good quarter of openings. You see under-construction hotels leave the pipeline, because they enter the system that's opening hotels, and that's good news for us. We have talked over the last couple of quarters about, albeit a steady increase in the number of construction starts, which is good news for us, but that constriction in the debt markets that I talked about, precluding us from getting back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of the pace of new construction starts, particularly here in the US. At the same time, we are encouraged by the continued increase in the pace of conversion activity, both on individual conversions and portfolio conversions. And I think it's that increased pace, coupled with a steady improvement in construction starts that gives us confidence in reaffirming the multi-year net unit growth numbers we shared with you last month during the Security Analyst Conference. And maybe with that, I'll ask Leeny to just give a little more color on the financing environment. Yes, good morning, Stephen. Yes, great question. Maybe the way I would answer that is, I like to describe those discussions as ever being binary. We don't look at it and say, let's pivot our focus away from our luxury leadership, for instance, towards focus on midscale. They are not mutually exclusive. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are very excited about the early returns of the focused resources we've put against our entry into mid-scale, the fact that we're already seeing letters of intent signed for Citi Express, even in almost 10 new countries. Then we've got signed deals very early in the launch of Four Points Express. Then we've got hundreds of identified markets for StudioRes, almost as the ink is drying on the FDD here in the US. And so that's extraordinarily exciting for us. But that does not require us to hit the pause button on extending our lead in the very valuable luxury segment. And so, that's a long-winded way of saying our strategy is to continue to strengthen our leadership position in luxury and upper upscale, while expanding our growth potential in a new segment for us, which is midscale. And so, as we roll out midscale, you've got products like City Express, which I think at least initially will be largely new build. I think the same is true for StudioRes. On the other hand you look at a platform like Four Points Express, we think there are extraordinary opportunities to roll out conversions under that platform. And as we mentioned during the analyst presentation, we will continue to look at every market we operate in and determine is there an opportunity for mid-scale? And if so, is it a new build opportunity, a virgin opportunity or both. No. I mean, obviously it's early, but what I will tell you is, we have a pretty extraordinary group of franchise partners who are brimming with excitement about our entry into this tier. And we're engaged with them on every continent talking about opportunities for midscale. So we don't find ourselves from a deal term perspective or a capital participation perspective doing anything out of the ordinary. Thank you. Yes. And then Richard, I think on your second question, if I heard it right, the way you ought to think about the brief delay of the integration of MGM is the way you described it, if I can hear you clearly, which is, that's principally an impact on the timing of the NUG impact, the impact on fees, or EBITDA if that was your question, is de minimis. You're welcome. Thank you. And maybe the only other color I would add, while it doesn't speak to 2025. In my opening remarks I talked about group revenue growth in the quarter both globally and for the US and Canada, and as Leeny and I have been traveling around the world.

And so, I think that the day of the week looks a little different, the segments look a little different, but the overall volumes are quite encouraging. Yes, great question. The short answer is I hope so. Bonvoy is such an extraordinarily powerful platform for us, it's a platform that strengthens the connectivity to our guests, ties together the breadth of our brand portfolio and partnerships like Rappi give us greater stickiness with the platform and allow us to connect more deeply in, in the case of Rappi, in markets like Latin America. They have to make sense for both sides to be obvious, but Bonvoy gives us a terrific opportunity to explore, create, and take advantage of those sorts of partnerships. And so, we will absolutely continue to look for those sorts of opportunities. Welcome. Great. Well, thank you again for all your interest and great questions this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in Marriott and look forward to seeing you on the road. Have a great afternoon."

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our strong third quarter results reflect solid momentum in our business around the world and came in ahead of our expectations. As Tony noted, worldwide RevPAR grew 9% above the top end of our guidance, led by meaningful gains in Asia Pacific. Global occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, 3 percentage points higher than a year ago, and global ADR continued to rise, growing 4%. Total company gross fee revenues totaled $1.2 billion, in line with our guidance and 13% above the prior year quarter. Fees would have been higher given our RevPAR performance, but for the negative impact of the wildfires in Maui, which primarily affected our IMFs. Total IMFs still grew meaningfully, rising 35% to $143 million in the quarter. International IMFs rose nearly 60% benefiting from another quarter of significant RevPAR increases in Asia Pacific. Our non-RevPAR related franchise fees grew 8% to $208 million, boosted by another strong quarter for our co-brand credit cards, partially offset by lower residential branding fees. Co-brand credit fees rose 11% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of robust global card spend and new card acquisition. Our owned lease and other revenue, net of direct expenses reached $70 million in the quarter, given continued improved performance at our owned and leased hotel. With the operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA rose 16% to $1.14 billion. After another quarter of meaningful share buybacks, diluted adjusted EPS grew 25% year-over-year to $2.11. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. And our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. In the first nine months of this year, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders. Over the last seven years, which included two years of no share repurchases as a result of COVID, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 23%, while at the same time investing meaningfully in innovation and growth. Now, let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. While there is heightened geopolitical risk and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, the consumer is still generally holding up well and our forward bookings through the end of the year in most regions around the world remain solid. We're raising our full-year RevPAR guidance to incorporate the better than anticipated third quarter results, as well as higher expectations for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we've seen a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. We now anticipate fourth quarter RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% in the US and Canada, and 14% to 16% internationally. This would lead to global RevPAR growth of 6% to 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 14% to 15% for the full year. We now expect full year total gross fee revenues could rise 17% to 18% with fourth quarter gross fees benefiting a bit from the higher RevPAR expectation. This is expected to be partially offset by lower expected residential branding fees due to anticipated completion of certain projects slipping into next year, as well as a bit softer results in Israel and surrounding countries. We've started to see some cancellations and softer demand for our five hotels in Israel, as well as for the 27 hotels in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. Fees for these four countries made up less than 1% of total company gross fees in full year 2022. We've not seen a meaningful impact on demand in the rest of the Middle East. We're keeping a close eye on the situation and working closely with our teams from the ground as events unfold. Total non- RevPAR related fees are expected to increase around 5% for the full year, benefiting from credit card fees rising roughly 10%, thanks to robust growth and average spend in the number of cardholders, partially offset by meaningfully lower residential branding fees this year versus our peak levels in 2022. Residential fees are tied to the sales of new units and tend to be lumpy as projects enter sales and closing spaces. Owned, leased and other net is now expected to be around $330 million for the full year, at the low end of our previous guidance range, primarily due to the restructuring of an existing lease on a hotel in New York that recently flipped to franchise. We expect 2023 G&A expenses to be around $935 million at the high end of our prior range, primarily due to higher compensation and legal expenses and to a lesser extent MGM integration costs. Compared to 2022, full-year adjusted EBITDA could increase 19% to 20% and adjusted EPS could rise 27% to 28%. We expect to return between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders for the full year 2023. This now assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $950 million, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. As we've discussed, with our major technology transformation, technology spending will be elevated this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. As we look into 2024, we continue to be enthusiastic about healthy global lodging demand for our brands and our strong pipeline growth. While we are still in the middle of putting together our property budgets for 2024, we believe the modeled global RevPAR range for 2024 of 3% to 6% we discussed at September Security Analyst Meeting is appropriate. Thank you for your interest in Marriott. Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions. Yes, sure. So there is couple of comments overall, Shaun. One is, just a reminder that the under-construction component of our pipeline also very typically includes conversions that may be going through some element of renovation before they open. And so, it's not quite the same as pre-COVID, which had a lower percentage of conversions for the company overall. So, as we've talked about before, we would expect, for example, perhaps roughly 30% of the openings in 2024 to be from conversions, which means, they can be in the pipeline a bit differently than the classic new build timing for being in the pipeline. So I think that the nature of the under construction pipeline could be perhaps a little bit different than pre-COVID. But as Tony was describing, you've clearly got the reality that in Asia Pacific and a number of other markets, there is meaningfully less dependence on the debt markets. And those markets are seeing much more stereotypical signings and progress into rooms under construction. While in the US, what you see is that, there is clearly still an open financing market for strong brands, strong market locations, demonstrated developer success. And in those, we are absolutely continuing to see that the financing is happening and that the rooms are getting under construction. The main difference, I would say is, they're taking a bit longer to actually get under construction. But as we kind of look going forward, the ones that are getting under construction are moving forward and then opening right on time. So as Tony said, overall, we're pleased to see the net rooms growth, for example, that we actually raised a bit for 2023, reflecting continued strong demand for our brands and also rooms getting finished and open, as well as really strong signings going into the pipeline. So overall, we're actually quite pleased on the new rooms front. Yes, sure. Thanks very much. As I mentioned in my comments, we continue to feel good about the 3% to 6% range that we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting. It's worth noting, however, Stephen, that we are smack in the middle of the process of building the budgets at the hotel level and moving up. So we're not prepared to give kind of formal guidance at this point. But when we look, broadly speaking, at seeing continued demand for travel, and as we talk about in the US, we would expect that that will remain in this more normalized seasonal patterns that we've now come to see. You've seen our guidance for Q4 being 3% to 4%, which reflects that. But we've got some basic strong fundamentals. Low supply growth for several years, which looks to continue to be the way going into 2024, and that's reflected in our higher percentage of conversions. And we do expect to see another year of strong growth in our special corporate rate on top of very strong growth in that rate in 2023. As we talked about in seeing our group pace, which is up 14%, that's actually got strong both rooms growth, as well as strong rate growth in the US, which does also bode well for continued sustainability in ADR. And I'll probably throw in one extra, which is that, in luxury, you probably remember we talked about that having in Q2, RevPAR was down ever so slightly in our luxury US and Canada properties just down by 1% in Q2, but that actually moved positive again in Q3 and was actually up 2%. So, I put all those together and, of course, this does depend greatly on the overall macroeconomic conditions and we will need to see where that goes. But given what we look at right now, we continue to feel good about the fundamentals. I think at this stage of the game, since we're really working through all of the budget work and kind of looking at investment spending, et cetera, again, the broad guidelines that we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting remain consistent. You will remember that we talked about an expectation of having the Sheraton Grand Chicago put to Marriott in 2024, which will be a use of cash we would expect at the end of 2024, and that was on top of the investment spending levels that were more normalized. But I think the philosophy, Smedes, remains exactly the same, which is, to say we do like where we are in terms of our credit ratios being at the lower end of our adjusted debt to adjusted [EBITDAR] (ph) and would expect to remain in that territory given the various kind of uncertainties that are out there. But other than that, the basic equation that you have seen us use for quite a number of years, I would expect to be similar, which would then result in substantial amounts of capital being returned to our shareholders. Sure. So thanks, Robin. As we talked about in our comments and at the Security Analyst Meeting, I think when you've got a deal like MGM or City Express, things can be a little lumpy in terms of the specific year-over-year rooms growth. And so, I do think it's much more important to be looking more broadly at the two to three year CAGR sort of numbers. And there clearly with the 2.4% higher room count as a result of MGM, that's obviously going to help 2024's number a lot. And you saw that our 2023 number came down, although it actually went up apart from MGM compared to a quarter ago. So I think the main thing I would focus on is that, we continue to feel really good about the 5% to 5.5% net rooms growth over the 2022 through 2025 time period. And we will obviously, as we get to full budget details, when we get to February, we'll be more specific. But I think, again, the basic earnings equation and growth model of the company is exactly as we described in September at the Security Analyst Meeting. Again, as I described, we have talked about continuing to feel very confident about the three-year 5% to 5.5% and are pleased to see the 2023 number move up a quarter of a point compared to a quarter ago. But we are in the middle of that process as we speak and we'll be able to be more specific when we get to February. You're a little muddied on the actual call. So -- on some of your words. So, let me try to see what I can do with what you asked. On -- let's just talk, broadly speaking on IMFs, which is to say that, overall for the company we are up meaningfully in US And Canada year-to-date Q3, $194 million compared to $167 million -- sorry, to $221 million for the full year in 2022. So I would say we're going to end up higher and meaningfully higher than in 2019. And we were impacted as we talked about from the Maui fires in our IMFs by close to $10 million, which obviously are going to impact our IMF. So when I think about the percentage of hotels that are earning incentive fees in the US and Canada, we had, let's see, year-to-date, US and Canada is 31%, and that compares to year to date in 2022 of 26%. And so I think from that standpoint, we're really pleased with the margin work that's been done in the US and frankly around the world. The only other thing I'll point out is that, IMS for the year at $537 million year-to-date are higher than IMS for the full year in 2022 already, just through three quarters. So again, the margins there I think show really well. Was there a second question? So I'll talk about a couple stats and then Tony may want to add anything kind of from a more broad perspective. Just one thing that's worth noting is that, group is back to being about the same percentage of our business that it was pre-COVID. So very squarely, almost a quarter of the business is related to groups. So I think you are seeing it normalizing there. And the numbers that we've talked about in US and Canada of 14%, that's obviously on a business that is really settled down into more normal seasonal pattern rather than still having lots of revenge travel. I think one of the interesting things is there, while some of the special corporate business has not returned in exactly the same form that it was pre-COVID, I think there is also the reality that companies are recognizing the value of getting together and are doing it in groups, maybe not in quite the same way they were doing some business transient. So, when you look at the overall proportion of the business, it is really leisure and business transient that was swapped a little bit, while group remains quite consistent to the way it was pre-COVID. No particular trends of notice relative to kind of your point about more kind of some trends in companies. We do have longer group booking windows overall, which reflect the fact that people are finding that the hotels are full and that they need to get their groups on the books. So that part remains consistent. I would not say that we see any kind of notable difference between leisure group and business group, either kind of in the past several months or frankly over the last several years, there is a steady diet of both of those. The only thing I would add is that, if this trend around experiences versus goods, which we continue to see a really positive element of demand. So whether it is for music concerts or professional sports games or for youth athletics or all of those pieces of people's lives, that continues to be a great driver of demand for travel and really is quite global. So again, kind of a realization on the part of people that travel is a fundamental part of life and one that is very much appreciated."

Our terrific second quarter results demonstrate the strength of global lodging demand and the success of our growth strategies. I've experienced a robust demand for lodging firsthand as I've been on the road a lot this year and have had the privilege of visiting every one of our regions. It has been wonderful to spend time with our team of hard-working and dedicated associates at properties around the world and to see how quickly global travel has rebounded. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR rose 13.5% versus the 2022 quarter, led by another quarter of meaningful recovery in Greater China. Less than two quarters after travel restrictions were lifted, RevPAR in Greater China has now surpassed 2019 levels, primarily due to the surge in domestic demand. Worldwide occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, five percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. With our unwavering focus on maximizing revenues, global ADR grew 6% year-over-year. Global leisure demand and ADR remained robust. Second quarter leisure transient room nights and ADR each increased 5% year-over-year, yielding 10% revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 1% above last year's sensational second quarter. Demand in this market has been stabilizing on a year-over-year basis with travelers from the region increasingly taking vacations overseas now that pandemic-related travel restrictions are behind us. Leisure room nights from the US and Canadian travelers jumped 90% in Asia Pacific and over 20% in Europe compared to the same period last year. The group segment had another great quarter with revenues in the US and Canada growing 10% year-over-year, driven by both rate and occupancy. Group revenues are expected to remain strong going forward. At the end of June, group revenue for the back half of 2023 was pacing up 11% to last year. Meeting planners are beginning to book further out, a trend we're also seeing with transient customers. Group revenue for full year 2024 was pacing up 14% year-over-year at the end of the quarter, an improvement from up 9% just three months prior. Recovery in business transient demand remained slow, but steady with demand from our top corporate accounts progressing modestly in the quarter. In the US and Canada, ADR again rose nicely compared to 2022, thanks to high single-digit special corporate rate increases. This led to business transient revenues rising 12% year-over-year. Overall, cross-border travel demand also rose again in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in international visitors to the Asia-Pacific region. The percent of total room nights from cross-border guests is now roughly one percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. Prior to the pandemic, international visitors accounted for nearly one quarter of room nights in Greater China. With the region's international airlift still only around 40% of 2019 capacity at the end of the second quarter, we believe there is still meaningful growth opportunity in and from Greater China. We remain keenly focused on strengthening our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which has over 186 million members. To further build engagement, we continued to enrich the platform with an enhanced booking experience, more choices for customers, and complementary products that drive more value and capture share of wallet, such as our co-branded credit cards and travel insurance. Our international credit cards had a record quarter, driving global card acquisitions up 25% and global card spend up 10% versus the year ago quarter. We are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance the guest experience, to drive profitability for our owners and to simplify processes for our associates. As we've mentioned previously, we are in the process of a major global transformation of our digital and core technology. We will be launching new reservations, loyalty and property management platforms over the next several years and look forward to the numerous capabilities these new systems will offer our key constituents. As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences. We also recently announced our plans of new affordable mid-scale extended stay offering in the U.S. and Canada. Our deep experience and leading position in extended-stay lodging, coupled with the recent trends toward increased work flexibility and longer stay travel, make us very optimistic about our growth potential. While it is still early days, initial interest from the development community has been extraordinary. We are working on several hundred deals and hope to have our first deal signed by the end of this year. In the Caribbean and Latin America, we're very excited about the recent addition of City Express to our brand lineup. These mid-scale properties have started to join our distribution channels, and we are thrilled with the noticeable uplift in conversion rates, ADR and bookings so far. Our development team remains focused on driving conversions, especially multiunit opportunities, and interest from owners remains robust. In the first half of this year, convergence accounted for 21% of our organic room additions, including MGM, and conversions represented 63% of our organic signings through June. The MGM rooms entering our system beginning this fall will boost our rooms distribution in 2023 by 2.4%. With more than half the year behind us, we have refined our full year net rooms growth expectations to 6.4% to 6.7%. Driving valuable global growth is a top company priority, and we are very pleased with the strong rate at which we expect our industry-leading system to grow this year. We look forward to sharing more about many key aspects of our business, including our broad global portfolio of over 30 brands, their exciting growth prospects all over the world, Marriott Bonvoy, the brand that brings it all together, our technology transformation and our multiyear financial model at our Investor Day on September 27. Now I'll hand the call over to Leeny to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail as well as our updated outlook for 2023. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our strong second quarter results reflected solid demand in ADR growth around the world with Greater China RevPAR more than doubling, international RevPAR rose an impressive 39% over the 2022 second quarter. Occupancy for our international regions reached 68%, a 12 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter and ADR increased 14%. RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada grew 6% versus the year ago quarter. Occupancy reached 74%, up 1 percentage point, while ADR increased 4%. While demand from both business and leisure guests remained strong, growth rates are stabilizing as we return to more normalized year-over-year comparisons. Total company's gross fee revenues totaled $1.25 billion, rising 16%, led by meaningful growth in incentive management fees or IMF. IMF totaled $193 million in the quarter, with fees in Greater China up significantly, given the strong recovery in that region. Impressively, our IMF in the first half of 2023 were 19% higher than peak IMF in the first half of 2018. Our owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses grew 24% despite lower termination fees, largely due to improved performance at our owned and leased hotels. Our strong IMF and owned, leased performance demonstrate our operating team's terrific work at driving profitability. Corporate G&A rose to 4%, well-above the rate of top line growth with the strong operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA reached a record $1.2 billion, up an impressive 20% year-over-year. On the development front, we're closely monitoring the financing environment, which remains tight around the world. While the US and Europe are facing the most lending challenges, even in these markets, financing has not come to a standstill. Over the past few months, many owners in these regions have been able to secure financing and begin construction. In most of our other regions, there's much less dependence on debt financing for new deals, so hotel construction generally continues apace. Properties in our industry leading 547, 000 room pipeline that are already under construction continue to move forward. And we've not seen the number of deals leaving the pipeline increase. Global fallout in the quarter was 1.3%, below our historic quarterly average of just over 2%. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings release. With the better than expected second quarter results and robust global booking trends, especially internationally, we're raising our full year guidance. While there is still a level of macroeconomic uncertainty, as we look into the third quarter, the consumer is generally holding up well and our forward bookings remain solid. In the US, it now seems more likely that the US economy could have a soft landing. Our updated guidance range assumes relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand. Growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we're seeing a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. For the full year, we now expect 7% to 9% RevPAR growth in the US and Canada. We're raising our expectation for international RevPAR growth to 28% to 30%, leading to an expected 12% to 14% increase in global RevPAR. Total fees for the full year could rise between 16% and 18% with the non-RevPAR related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR related fees are expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 level. Compared to 2022, full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 18% and 21% and adjusted EPS could rise 25% to 29%. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. In the first half of this year, our net cash provided by operating activities surpassed $1.5 billion, nearly 50% higher than the same period last year. We've returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through June. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders in 2023. This assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $1 billion, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. With our major technology transformation, we will also have elevated technology spending this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Thank you for your interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start off, just on the non-RevPAR related fees. You gave some color on that in the quarter. But I guess what are your expectations for the remainder of the year? And can you just remind us on how those contracts were structured in terms of length of term, is there an opportunity to renegotiate those coming up?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. No, we've got several years left on them, Stephen, and are really pleased with the continued growth in the credit card fees, and frankly, really particularly pleased with adding so many new countries. So I think when you look at credit card fees for the year, I think, broadly speaking, a double-digit growth rate is right. Now for total non-RevPAR fees, we've talked about a 4% to 7% growth in non-RevPAR fees because of the lumpiness of things like residential fees. And the reality, as you remember, our timeshare fees are overwhelmingly a flat payment that go up only slightly. So overall, I think we're looking at 4% to 7%. But again, on the credit card side, we continue to see really strong growth.\nStephen Grambling: Great. And then as a follow-up, it's unrelated. Just on the technology investment. Obviously, a lot of talk about AI recently across all industries. How are you generally thinking about the tech investment with an eye on positioning yourself towards leveraging these types of new technologies?\nTony Capuano : Sure, Stephen, I'll try and take that one. I think, obviously, AI has already incorporated into how we think about running our business. It has been for a while. We continue to look for opportunities to leverage evolving technologies like AI to remove friction for our guests, to create capacity for our associates. But we do it in a way that is mindful, mindful of how rapidly the technology is evolving and mindful of some of the real important considerations around facets of evolving technology like privacy.\nStephen Grambling: Great. Thanks so much.\nLeeny Oberg: Stephen, the only thing I'll add -- Stephen, the only thing I'll add to that is the reality that at the end of the day, we do believe that it is the person-to-person and the experiential part of our business that makes it so unique. So being able to use generational AI in a way that enhances that service, we see as a real benefit, but never to take away from the fundamental people-to-people part of our business.\nStephen Grambling: Right. Before during and after the stay.\nLeeny Oberg: Right.\nStephen Grambling: Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Good morning, Tony and Leeny.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nShaun Kelley: So we continue to get a lot of questions from investors on the net unit growth side of the equation, and I appreciate all the color that you gave. So maybe we could just dig in a little further. It looks like at the very high end of the range of what you provided previously, you trimmed that very modestly, excluding sort of the deal with MGM. So could you talk about just that change, and more broadly, what you're seeing in the environment? And then I think the second part of the follow-up would be as we look a little further out, and I don't want to steal too much thunder from the Analyst Day, but what are the preconditions necessary to think that maybe this year could actually be close to the trough. What would have to go right to see, let's call it, core growth ex City Express and ex MGM actually improve in 2024 or beyond?\nTony Capuano: Sure. Shaun, let me start and then I'm sure Leeny will chime in. On your first question, you're right, there is a very modest kind of a 20 bps adjustment at the high end to the guidance. We are delighted with the impact of this terrific MGM deal to so meaningfully increase our guidance for net unit growth for 2023. That little tweak at the high end really is reflective of kind of normal ins and outs. On the plus side, we've seen a little lower deletions to the system than we had visibility into a quarter ago. And then we've seen a handful of projects that we still are confident will open, but we've seen the timing of a handful of those openings slip into early 2024. And it's those ins and outs that led to that modest tweak to the high end of the guidance. On your second question, I would suggest to you that last year was probably the bottom of the trough. The numbers we've seen, particularly on the conversion front, are leading strong growth towards that mid-single-digit unit growth that you've become accustomed to in your time covering Marriott. I think in terms of continued improvement. You'll hear a little more of this from Leeny. I think the biggest thing we're hoping for now is continued relief from the constriction we see in the debt markets in the US and Europe for new construction. We're seeing powerful interest on the conversion side. We're seeing no shortage of developer interest or availability of the equity. I think the one impediment we're seeing is it's not an absolute absence of debt, but we're not seeing the free-flowing debt we saw a few quarters ago.\nLeeny Oberg: So Shaun, the only other thing that I would add is the reality that you've heard us talk more and more about multiunit conversions, which does make things a little bit lumpier on the rooms growth. If you remember, when we added a big slug of all-inclusive rooms a couple of years ago, when you look at the MGM deal that we recently announced, I take your point that M&A would be looked at separately. But I do think on the conversion side, you should continue to see us chasing these lovely multi-unit conversion opportunities that can bounce the numbers around a little bit, but definitely give us confidence in our mid-single-digit net rooms growth number as we look forward.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the MGM deal.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Shaun.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jeff -- I'm sorry from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody.\nLeeny Oberg: Hey, Joe.\nTony Capuano: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: I have two questions. One, what's embedded in your full year fee guidance for incentive management fees? It looked like in the 2Q IMF per managed room was up nice 13% over 2019. How does what you have incorporated in full year guidance for IMF, how does that compare on a per-room management basis to 2019, both domestically and internationally?\nLeeny Oberg: So Joe, we can work through the per room. Obviously, we've got the reality that the system overall is about 11% bigger than it was in 2019. So those comparisons start to be a little bit less meaningful. But to your point about where IMF should be for the full year, I think what you've seen in what we reported today clearly points to the reality that we hope, assuming things continue the way our guidance predicts, is a number of IMF that exceeds our 2019 peak by a good amount. The amount of percentage of hotels earning incentive fees so far is 62% in Q2 versus 72% in 2019. So we're clearly getting much closer. And in Asia Pacific, it's in the mid-80s in both years. So I think it -- as you know, we've got a different structure of IMF in Asia Pacific. And as our growth has been outsized in that region, they have a very positive quality of behaving much more like base fees. So I think you should continue to see strong growth there. In Q2, we were looking at about 41% coming from the US and Canada and 30% coming from Asia Pacific. So we're getting much closer to our 2019 proportion of incentive fees. And again, as we talked about before, when we look for the rest of the year, we do see the reality that we expect IMF to be higher than our peak.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up relates to the -- the MGM deal that you recently announced. Can you talk about broadly the economics and how it works for you? And let's -- I know it kind of works in a couple of ways. What you put in MGM's portfolio and then what you get kind of one-third in the Marriott system as the newer people exporting out to your properties around the world. But let's say, the direct channel is such where you're putting in 5% to 10% of MGM's occupied room nights per year, how much of that indirect annual fees could something like that generate, or can you give us some sort of way of thinking about the fee magnitude? I know, it's probably different than the average franchise and licensing fee per room. But helping us understand the economics there, I think, would be helpful.\nTony Capuano: Yes. So it may not surprise you, Joe. We're not going to go into granular detail on the economics of a specific deal. What I can tell you is the structure of the transaction is akin -- much more akin to a traditional franchise deal. We are getting paid on room revenue across their US portfolio of 17 resorts. It's not just some sort of loyalty lockup. It's structured to look a lot more like a franchise agreement. The reason is we talk about it as a strategic licensing agreement. It's more broad than what we had with the Cosmopolitan, which was, in fact, a straight franchise agreement. Here, we've got a much broader ability with the creation of the MGM Collection portfolio to make this a much bigger play for our 186 million Bonvoy members in terms of the ability to give them access to the wealth of content that MGM makes available, to link the 186 million Bonvoy members and the 40 million MGM Rewards members, and as a corollary, to be a loyalty partner with that MGM. So, we've called it a strategic licensing agreement because of some of those complexities. But in terms of the way we've structured the financial arrangements, you should think about it more through the lens of a more traditional franchise agreement structure.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just got a question on the remaining occupancy slice you've got to get back. Your occupancy today is still sitting about 4% lower than it was in 2019. How much confidence you can get the rest of that back? And is there any need to cut prices to get that back in? Is there any price elasticity you need to drive to get the remaining bit of occupancy back in the system?\nLeeny Oberg: So, I'll--\nTony Capuano: Go ahead.\nLeeny Oberg: No, you go, Tony.\nTony Capuano: No, I was just going to say, yes, you're right, Richard. We're still down about three points on a global basis. But we see some real opportunities for growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see steady recovery on the business transient side, which gives us some optimism. And we continue to see continued recovery on cross-border travel, which gives us another layer of optimism. And then I would say, third, as I mentioned, in Greater China, which is our second largest market, you've still only got about a 40% recovery of cross-border airline capacity. And so in terms of inbound and outbound international travel related to China, we think there's some real opportunity for occupancy recovery there as well. And then, lastly, you've heard us talk about this the last couple of quarters, but we continue to see in the data real legs to this phenomenon of blended trip purpose and we think that's going to continue to drive occupancy, particularly in the days of the week that historically we considered shoulder days.\nRichard Clarke: Maybe just as a follow-up to that, your kind of composite US and Canada luxury RevPAR down year-on-year in the in the quarter. I mean, how much are you putting that down to the international travel moving overseas from the U.S. or is there some overall price moderation going on within luxury properties there?\nA \u2013 Leeny Oberg: So I'll jump -- I'll start, Tony, and feel free to jump in. So a couple of things. Certainly, we do attribute it to the reality that a year ago in Q2, there were meaningfully fewer choices for travel. They really were consistent restrictions for going overseas, last airlift, et cetera. And there's clear that when you look at the travel patterns this year that there is a big exodus of Americans going over to Europe and other places in the world. So that certainly had an impact. The other thing I would say is that on luxury in the U.S., we actually saw a strengthening in the metropolitan areas. And they, in general, have a little bit lower RevPAR than some of the resorts. So some of this is a bit of a mix shift. And as you saw, the rate hardly moved in U.S. and Canada in Q2, and that was off of a year last year in Q2 where luxury rates were extraordinary. So just as a reminder, luxury rates have -- in U.S. and Canada have actually outpaced inflation when you compare to '19 and that still is the case while the other segments are coming more and more in line with inflation-adjusted rates as they continue to gain, as you saw ADR up 4% in the second quarter. And as we also said in our prepared remarks, there is a normalization going on. There's definitely a more seasonal pattern to travel, and frankly, a nice sturdy mix of leisure, business transient and group that supports pricing going forward for the industry, we think.\nRichard Clarke: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just focus on the capital returns for a bit, which had a significant bump, and again, my sense is that this is something you'll discuss in analyst meeting. But can you help us just look out a little bit and assume that the business momentum continues? And maybe just help us calibrate how you think about the growth in that capital return if we can make our own assumptions about where the business would go.\nA \u2013 Leeny Oberg: Sure. Thanks for the question. You're right, the adjusted EBITDA and strong cash flow kind of move upward in our guidance has given us a view to increase our expected capital returns this year. And just in basic math, the midpoint of our EBITDA moved up approximately roughly $150 million, about half of it outperformance in Q2 and about half of it increased guidance in the back half of the year. And if you just kind of simply take that and lever it, it's pretty straightforward about how you see the increased capital returns. But I do want to go back to our first kind of the most important thing, which is that we first want to invest in our business to grow. And we want to do that in a way that provides returns that are attractive for our shareholders and do it in ways that kind of meet our strategic objectives. So that is always first on the list and then a consideration of how we see the business moving forward. We do have a more diversified earnings stream than we had before. We've got a more global earnings stream than we've had before. We've got strong operating leverage in the business. And so I would expect to continue to see this investing in the growth of our business, including our technology transformation. But then with the remaining cash, excess cash, being able to return it to our shareholders in this mix of a modest dividend and share repurchase.\nDavid Katz: Got it. And if I can, as my follow-up, just ask about really the top tier corporate business. I know there was some of this in your prepared remarks. But as we talk through the industry or industry related people, we get a sense that there is a Fortune 100 that's been slower to come back versus the SME that was much, much faster. An update there would be really helpful if there is some movement at the top as well?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So your characterization is accurate. The SMEs, which represent about 60% of our business transient segment, they were first fully recovered a quarter ago and their demand continues to be quite robust. The large corporate room nights continue to be recovering a bit more slowly. In Q1, we saw slow and steady recovery, and that continues to be the pace. What we hear from them anecdotally on, from one perspective, they continue to meet a great deal as they hire new staff, as they immerse them in their culture and do training meetings. And we think that's one of the drivers of the strength we're seeing in the group segment. Their international travel has been probably the slowest component of their travel to recover. And so it's a segment that we're monitoring closely, but it is certainly recovering more slowly than the SMEs.\nLeeny Oberg: The only thing I'll add, David, is that on the special corporate rate, I think it is worth noting that you've heard us talk before that we got nearly double-digit increases in negotiated rate this year. And as we look out to next year, we do -- we're starting to have those conversations and we are looking for an additional meaningful increase next year as well. And while you're right that the classic big four and tech firms are still down in night meaningfully compared to 2019, overall business transient is up compared to 2019 and we are continuing to see some recovery. So we do eventually think that it will get back to levels that we saw in 2019 on the special corporate side eventually. And again, overall business transient is doing well from a revenue perspective.\nTony Capuano: Yeah. And Dave, maybe just one clarification and additional comment. On the recovery of the SMEs, we saw them fully recover in Q1 of 2022, not 2023, just to make sure I'm precise. The other thing I will tell you is while the recovery of the large corporates has been not as rapid as what we've seen with the SMEs, we do see strong enough demand even with the large corporates that it is giving us pretty good pricing power. As we talked about a couple of quarters ago, and one of the underpinnings of the rate growth we saw in the quarter was our ability to negotiate high single-digit special corporate rates for 2023. And as we start in earnest to go into corporate rate negotiations for 2024, we have every expectation that we will be emerging from that rate negotiation season, having achieved high single-digit rate negotiated rates for the second straight year.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the loyalty program. And I'm sorry if you've shared this already, but what percent of occupancy came through loyalty members in the quarter. And could you just touch on maybe what you're seeing on direct bookings versus the percentage of bookings coming through OTAs?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. So just real quickly, overall, mid-50s for Bonvoy penetration, low 60s for U.S. and Canada. And when you look at -- we are still kind of mid-70s for direct contribution -- direct channel contribution for our bookings, and the OTA is 11% to 12%. So again, fairly stable. The main point is that our -- when you think about the digital channels, they have gained meaningfully more share over the past several years than the OTAs and grown very nicely. And when you look just kind of one last data point for you, when you think about redemptions as a percentage of our total room nights, it's 6%. And digital is mid-30s.\nSmedes Rose: Okay, okay. Thank you. And then as just last on e, can you talk a little bit more about how you guys are thinking about credit card fee growth. And you mentioned it was up double digit. Is it -- I mean I don't know if you can say it, but is it driven by incremental spending sort of on a same-store basis, or is it more driven by more cards going out there? And maybe how would you think about the sort of longer-term growth rate in that fee stream?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. All of the above. You've got great news in terms of adding cardholders. That is obviously a critical component to this, is adding additional cardholders. And we're very pleased with adding additional cardholders. And then obviously, it's the average spend on those existing cardholders. So as you see growth in those two, you get the growth in credit card, but just as importantly, is adding new countries. So when we add South Korea, Japan or China, it really opens up a new market that goes from zero to thousands of cards with growth potential that goes off many years into the future. And we are continuing to add additional countries. So we'll talk more in September about kind of how to think about that in a three-year model. But as I said, for this year, I think you can be looking at them for overall total credit card branding fees to be in about the roughly 10% range.\nSmedes Rose: Well, I can attest that my kids are helping on the fee growth for you. Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Well, thanks. We appreciate the support.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDori Kesten: Thanks, good morning. Where do you feel that your gap by region or brand type exists today?\nLeeny Oberg: So I'll start -- I'll start, Tony, and then you jump in. I think you've heard us talk about our entry into the affordable mid-scale space since the acquisition of City Express in CALA and with our conversation about MidX Studios, which is a mid-scale extended stay product that we're very excited about in the US and are having great conversations with owners. And really, we look at that around the world as providing great opportunities for us in addition to growing all of our other brands. I mean I think it's important to note that we think there's lots of room for us to have growth across all segments around the world and our existing brands. But for example, we're excited about what we see as the possibility for a conversion mid-scale brand in EMEA and look forward to some announcements in the back half of the year regarding that. So we'll continue to look to try to meet our customers' needs and expand our distribution in a way that strengthens Bonvoy.\nDori Kesten: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBill Crow: Hey, good morning. Tony, you talked about normalization in the US. We talked about it as well. And the last, I don't know, six weeks or so, we've seen RevPAR in the US plus or minus 1%, maybe up to 2%. Just curious what it is that you can look at and say, the real normalized rate might return more to 3% to 4%? What are the drivers out there to get us off this sub-inflationary growth rate?\nTony Capuano: Yes. Good question, Bill. I'd point to a few things and maybe I'll try to answer you going segment by segment. I talked in my prepared remarks about the leisure segment being up in the quarter 10%. One of the things that was really encouraging to me in the leisure segment was that, that 10% improvement was split almost perfectly evenly by both occupancy and rate improvement. We saw a 5% improvement in ADR, which I thought was quite encouraging. Similarly -- and that was a global number. Pivoting to the US, which I think was your question. In the US and Canada, we talked a little bit about group. Some of the pricing power we're seeing in group as evidenced by the revenue pace we're seeing, not only in the back half of 2023, where we're pacing up 11% in revenue, but also where we're seeing in 2024, where we're now pacing up 14%, which is already up 5 points just three months since the last time we talked to you about group pace. And then as you heard from Leeny, when she was asking one of the earlier questions about business transient, you have 6% ADR growth in business transient in the US and Canada, which I think is another data point. When you throw all that in the blender together, all of that gives us some comfort that there is some opportunity. The only thing, I would say to you, and you heard Leeny referenced this, we do expect year-over-year ADR to moderate a bit given some of the comparisons, particularly as we get into year three -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 but we do expect ADR to continue to grow through the back half of the year.\nBill Crow: Yeah. That's was it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning and congrats on these results. If we just play back your guidance revisions since the start of the year on international, we know Europe is strong. But how would you rank other international regions in terms of the contribution to that guidance revision? And if you would, it might be early here, but any early thoughts on domestic versus international growth rates into 2024?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So let me talk maybe a little bit about China, and then I'll let Leeny do the balance of the tour around the world. I talked in my prepared remarks about how encouraged we are about the recovery in China and the fact that Greater China as a market surpassed pre-pandemic RevPAR in the quarter. And it was able to achieve those results principally on the shoulders of domestic demand given some of the stats that I shared on the relatively modest recovery of international airline capacity. One of the stats that was really encouraging to me, if you look at Q2 RevPAR in Greater China, we were up almost 125% to last year. I think that speaks to the strength and pace of recovery in that market, but it also speaks to the quality of our distribution particularly in the major markets like Beijing and Shanghai. Leeny, you want to maybe talk a little about APAC and EMEA?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. And I think a lot of this is just about acceleration of recovery. So if you think about it, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly how airlift is going to go and how cross-border travel and how a country is going to emerge from the pandemic. And so I think the reality is that the recovery in China has come faster than we expected. And cross-border, while it is still meaningfully lower in China than it was pre-COVID, we've got international airlift only at 40% of pre-COVID level. So there's clearly more room to go. There's no doubt that as that country has rebounded. And as the rest of Asia Pacific has also really opened its borders completely, we've seen that all of the travel there has picked up very fast. So when I kind of go back to where at the beginning of the year, where you might have imagined Greater China and Asia Pacific outside of China, they are both up the most. I think the only other comment I would make is that, obviously, Europe this summer has dramatically outperformed expectations. And we continue to see really strong demand in Caribbean and Latin America and Middle East Africa. So international really benefiting from all the cross-border travel. And frankly, from a global economy that has probably been a bit stronger than everyone anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the detailed response. And maybe just a quick follow-up on MGM, does that effectively franchise agreement cover all of their revenue, or just revenue generated through your channels, through marriott. com, through Bonvoy, et cetera? Thanks for taking the questions.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So...\nTony Capuano: Go ahead, Leeny.\nLeeny Oberg: As you say, we're not going to get into the details of the calculation, but it is based on hotel revenues. So it is not an \u00e0 la carte sort of deal.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. Just circling back to the MGM deal, I guess, it was my understanding that even though it's a great partnership, that MGM would not be paying you franchise fees the way we would normally think about rooms in your pipeline paying 4% to 6% franchise fee. So I don't know if you can just clarify whether they would be paying franchisees the way we would normally think of your franchise fees being? And then my second question is the way the release is written, and I apologize if I'm interpreting this incorrectly, but it sounds like you're counting the MGM rooms in your rooms under construction. And I'm just wondering, is there some reason why you accounted them as new construction versus more of a conversion, if I'm interpreting that correctly? And then also, if I'm interpreting that correctly, your rooms under construction, excluding the MGM rooms, is like 30-something percent of your pipeline, whereas, historically have been in the high 40% range, closer to 50%? And just thinking about rooms like physically under construction as a percent of your pipeline being a bit lower, obviously, there's -- we know what's going on in the macro environment, but it seems like that would have implications for 2024 openings if the rooms under construction are, in fact, that low, if I'm interpreting it correctly from how you're counting MGM in the construction pipeline? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Sure. So I think there's three questions in there, I'll try to hit all three, Robin. On the first one, as Leeny mentioned, while we're not going to disclose the specific deal terms, this is structured very similar to a franchise agreement where we are receiving a royalty fee on rooms revenue. This is not as Leeny termed it, an \u00e0 la carte, where we're only getting paid on fees generated just through our proprietary channels. So I do think you should think about it through the lens of a more traditional franchise fee structure. On your second question, we typically do conversions, pending opening in our system are typically included as rooms under construction because they typically have some measure of property improvement plan, improvements and construction before they come into our system. Even in the case of MGM with extraordinary quality assets, there are, for instance, some life safety improvements and some other physical improvements that are required to those assets before they will be plugged into the system. And that's why they're characterized in that way. And on your third question, I'm doing the math just in my brain so we can do it more precisely for you. But if you take the quarter end pipeline and you back out those numbers or back out the MGM, we would have been a little over 500,000 rooms in the pipeline. And if you back the MGM numbers out of the under construction, we would have been a little over 200,000. So, it would have been 40%-ish under construction versus the 30% that you referenced. And so in terms of implications going forward, I'd reference a response I gave you maybe a quarter ago, which is for, I don't recall the precise number, but 20-some-odd quarters despite really strong openings we've continued consistently to have plus or minus 20,000 rooms under construction globally, which I don't think bodes quite well for our continued recovery to mid-single-digit net unit growth.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick clarification then. I wasn't counting when you gave rooms in your pipeline at quarter end, just since the MGM deal was announced in July. Are you including MGM in that number? It sounds like you are from the math you just walked us through. I just wanted to clarify.\nTony Capuano: In the pipeline, yes, we are in the 547,000, yes. So that would include -- to be more precise, that would include the roughly 37,000 incremental rooms that will come in, not the full 40,000 because the Cosmopolitan is already open and operating in the system as an Autograph as we sit here today.\nRobin Farley: It's included in your June 30 pipeline, even the--\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. The deal was signed before June 30. So, it's appropriate that it was in -- it was not announced until a few weeks ago, but it was signed.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one for me, maybe for Tony. Maybe you could just give us a view into the development backdrop in China as it stands today, just sort of the latest lay of the land in terms of starts and construction progress and any sort of acceleration and sort of how things look on the ground, that would be helpful?\nTony Capuano: Sure. Of course. So, maybe I'll sort of go in sequence. We are seeing a very encouraging uptick in the pace of development inquiries, a parallel uptick in the number of signed MOUs and then parallel committee submissions and approvals. As you'll recall from some of our previous conversations, oftentimes, unlike many other markets around the world, new construction hotels often come into our development process when those structures are well under construction as opposed to a US deal where it might come to us as a greenfield site. Many of those under construction buildings had been paused during the pandemic. We have seen parallel encouraging restart of many of those construction projects. So when we think about each of the milestones in the development of a hotel project or the life cycle of a hotel project, we're seeing encouraging uptick at every one of those milestones across Greater China.\nBrandt Montour: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nTony Capuano: You're welcome\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ari Klein with BMO Markets. Please go ahead.\nAri Klein: Thank you. Tony, you mentioned the strength of U.S. travel to overseas markets. Maybe can you update us on what you're seeing as far as international visitation into the U.S. and your outlook there and maybe what drives the resurgence?\nA \u2013 Tony Capuano: Sure. So I'm going to ask Leeny to remind me the exact percentage. But historically, the percentage of inbound international into the U.S. market has historically always been relatively modest, I think, sub-5%, if memory serves. And so as borders open, you're starting to see that recover, but it is not nearly as impactful as outbound U.S. into some of these international markets, as we've talked about in the past. Now the exception to that I will tell you is if you look at a couple of individual cities, Aryeh. And so just to give you a flavor, we were just looking at this the other day, use New York as an example and that may not surprise you a great deal. If you go back to 2019, the international traveler's share of transient room nights in New York in 2019. was 12%. In the second quarter, we actually exceeded that. In the second quarter of this year, 13% of transient room nights in the New York were international inbound. That city really stands out. There's only a handful of other U.S. -- major U.S. cities that are double digits. Washington -- or excuse me, Miami, is 12% in the quarter. It was about 15% back in 2019. San Francisco was 11% back in 2019. It was actually 10% in the second quarter. Hawaii, the state of Hawaii as a destination, was 12% in 2019 and it was actually 10% in the second quarter. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a flavor.\nAri Klein: Yes, I appreciate it. And then in the U.S. specifically, on the development pipeline, are you seeing any differences in the ability for owners to finance higher end or bigger project hotels versus the smaller ones that are maybe more selective?\nA \u2013 Leeny Oberg: So I'll start, and Tony, jump in. So the old saying continues to be true that proven markets, proven brands, proven developers, proven owners always wins out. And that is still the case. So it really depends on the project. I will say that we've seen such great impact from renovated hotels that I think there is the reality that an existing hotel that is not a new development project, that's not kind of not earning money for quite a while, that those are easier to do, especially when they're turning it into a fantastic representation of a particular brand. And I think those are getting done. But I think the reality is that both with the level of interest rates and the loan-to-values that are being required is that it's tougher to make these deals penciled. So they are happening. They're getting done. They're just not getting done at the same pace that they were before.\nAri Klein: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the MGM deal but focus on group. A couple of parts there. Maybe what's your view on the upside in Vegas for group business at these hotels. Maybe more broadly, how are your sales teams incentivized to put groups into certain hotels? And then presumably, Vegas is going to gain share. Maybe what's your view on the markets that lose share as group rotates into Vegas. Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Sure. So maybe I'll try at a high level, and then, Leeny, you might want to be a little more granular. Obviously, we think it's a huge win for our group customers. As you know, Michael, the way we sell group as we look at their multiyear rotational needs and for many of these particularly large groups, Las Vegas is always in their multiyear plan. While we had the ability to offer them the Cosmopolitan, the breadth of offerings we can now make available to them, particularly the largest of those groups that need very significant meeting space, we think we've got a terrific opportunity to keep them within the Marriott Group ecosystem much more effectively. Our sales teams will be collaborating closely, the Marriott and the MGM sales teams, to ensure we capture as much of that demand as possible. In terms of markets that might be impacted by that, most of those groups are rotating through Las Vegas as a destination anyway. And so I don't think we're deeply concerned that groups going there will be at the expense of those destinations. We just think we have a better probability of capturing that Las Vegas rotation within the Marriott ecosystem.\nOperator: And at this time, this will conclude our Q&A as we are at alloted time. I will turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for closing remarks.\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you all for your interest this morning. I wish you safe travels, and we look forward to seeing all of you in Miami this September. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our terrific second quarter results demonstrate the strength of global lodging demand and the success of our growth strategies. I've experienced a robust demand for lodging firsthand as I've been on the road a lot this year and have had the privilege of visiting every one of our regions. It has been wonderful to spend time with our team of hard-working and dedicated associates at properties around the world and to see how quickly global travel has rebounded. Second quarter worldwide RevPAR rose 13.5% versus the 2022 quarter, led by another quarter of meaningful recovery in Greater China. Less than two quarters after travel restrictions were lifted, RevPAR in Greater China has now surpassed 2019 levels, primarily due to the surge in domestic demand. Worldwide occupancy in the quarter reached 72%, five percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. With our unwavering focus on maximizing revenues, global ADR grew 6% year-over-year. Global leisure demand and ADR remained robust. Second quarter leisure transient room nights and ADR each increased 5% year-over-year, yielding 10% revenue growth. In the US and Canada, leisure revenues rose 1% above last year's sensational second quarter. Demand in this market has been stabilizing on a year-over-year basis with travelers from the region increasingly taking vacations overseas now that pandemic-related travel restrictions are behind us. Leisure room nights from the US and Canadian travelers jumped 90% in Asia Pacific and over 20% in Europe compared to the same period last year. The group segment had another great quarter with revenues in the US and Canada growing 10% year-over-year, driven by both rate and occupancy. Group revenues are expected to remain strong going forward. At the end of June, group revenue for the back half of 2023 was pacing up 11% to last year. Meeting planners are beginning to book further out, a trend we're also seeing with transient customers. Group revenue for full year 2024 was pacing up 14% year-over-year at the end of the quarter, an improvement from up 9% just three months prior. Recovery in business transient demand remained slow, but steady with demand from our top corporate accounts progressing modestly in the quarter. In the US and Canada, ADR again rose nicely compared to 2022, thanks to high single-digit special corporate rate increases. This led to business transient revenues rising 12% year-over-year. Overall, cross-border travel demand also rose again in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in international visitors to the Asia-Pacific region. The percent of total room nights from cross-border guests is now roughly one percentage point below 2019 levels of approximately 20%. Prior to the pandemic, international visitors accounted for nearly one quarter of room nights in Greater China. With the region's international airlift still only around 40% of 2019 capacity at the end of the second quarter, we believe there is still meaningful growth opportunity in and from Greater China. We remain keenly focused on strengthening our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which has over 186 million members. To further build engagement, we continued to enrich the platform with an enhanced booking experience, more choices for customers, and complementary products that drive more value and capture share of wallet, such as our co-branded credit cards and travel insurance. Our international credit cards had a record quarter, driving global card acquisitions up 25% and global card spend up 10% versus the year ago quarter. We are increasingly leveraging technology to enhance the guest experience, to drive profitability for our owners and to simplify processes for our associates. As we've mentioned previously, we are in the process of a major global transformation of our digital and core technology. We will be launching new reservations, loyalty and property management platforms over the next several years and look forward to the numerous capabilities these new systems will offer our key constituents. As we focus on paths for growth, we are adding new offerings and experiences in segments where we believe there is strong consumer interest beyond our current brands. A great example is our recent announcement of an exclusive 20-year strategic license agreement with MGM Resorts International and the creation of MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy. The collection, which will launch beginning in October, encompasses 17 resorts with 40,000 rooms. This deal will provide us with significant presence in Las Vegas, one of the most popular destinations in the country with fantastic properties like Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and ARIA, as well as additional distribution in five other key US cities. Beyond just hotels, our strategic agreement with MGM will also give our members access to more sports, music, culinary and entertainment experiences. We also recently announced our plans of new affordable mid-scale extended stay offering in the U.S. and Canada. Our deep experience and leading position in extended-stay lodging, coupled with the recent trends toward increased work flexibility and longer stay travel, make us very optimistic about our growth potential. While it is still early days, initial interest from the development community has been extraordinary. We are working on several hundred deals and hope to have our first deal signed by the end of this year. In the Caribbean and Latin America, we're very excited about the recent addition of City Express to our brand lineup. These mid-scale properties have started to join our distribution channels, and we are thrilled with the noticeable uplift in conversion rates, ADR and bookings so far. Our development team remains focused on driving conversions, especially multiunit opportunities, and interest from owners remains robust. In the first half of this year, convergence accounted for 21% of our organic room additions, including MGM, and conversions represented 63% of our organic signings through June. The MGM rooms entering our system beginning this fall will boost our rooms distribution in 2023 by 2.4%. With more than half the year behind us, we have refined our full year net rooms growth expectations to 6.4% to 6.7%. Driving valuable global growth is a top company priority, and we are very pleased with the strong rate at which we expect our industry-leading system to grow this year. We look forward to sharing more about many key aspects of our business, including our broad global portfolio of over 30 brands, their exciting growth prospects all over the world, Marriott Bonvoy, the brand that brings it all together, our technology transformation and our multiyear financial model at our Investor Day on September 27. Now I'll hand the call over to Leeny to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail as well as our updated outlook for 2023. Leeny? Sure, Stephen, I'll try and take that one. I think, obviously, AI has already incorporated into how we think about running our business. It has been for a while. We continue to look for opportunities to leverage evolving technologies like AI to remove friction for our guests, to create capacity for our associates. But we do it in a way that is mindful, mindful of how rapidly the technology is evolving and mindful of some of the real important considerations around facets of evolving technology like privacy. Thanks, Steve. Sure. Shaun, let me start and then I'm sure Leeny will chime in. On your first question, you're right, there is a very modest kind of a 20 bps adjustment at the high end to the guidance. We are delighted with the impact of this terrific MGM deal to so meaningfully increase our guidance for net unit growth for 2023. That little tweak at the high end really is reflective of kind of normal ins and outs. On the plus side, we've seen a little lower deletions to the system than we had visibility into a quarter ago. And then we've seen a handful of projects that we still are confident will open, but we've seen the timing of a handful of those openings slip into early 2024. And it's those ins and outs that led to that modest tweak to the high end of the guidance. On your second question, I would suggest to you that last year was probably the bottom of the trough. The numbers we've seen, particularly on the conversion front, are leading strong growth towards that mid-single-digit unit growth that you've become accustomed to in your time covering Marriott. I think in terms of continued improvement. You'll hear a little more of this from Leeny. I think the biggest thing we're hoping for now is continued relief from the constriction we see in the debt markets in the US and Europe for new construction. We're seeing powerful interest on the conversion side. We're seeing no shortage of developer interest or availability of the equity. I think the one impediment we're seeing is it's not an absolute absence of debt, but we're not seeing the free-flowing debt we saw a few quarters ago. Thanks, Shaun. Hi, Joe. Yes. So it may not surprise you, Joe. We're not going to go into granular detail on the economics of a specific deal. What I can tell you is the structure of the transaction is akin -- much more akin to a traditional franchise deal. We are getting paid on room revenue across their US portfolio of 17 resorts. It's not just some sort of loyalty lockup. It's structured to look a lot more like a franchise agreement. The reason is we talk about it as a strategic licensing agreement. It's more broad than what we had with the Cosmopolitan, which was, in fact, a straight franchise agreement. Here, we've got a much broader ability with the creation of the MGM Collection portfolio to make this a much bigger play for our 186 million Bonvoy members in terms of the ability to give them access to the wealth of content that MGM makes available, to link the 186 million Bonvoy members and the 40 million MGM Rewards members, and as a corollary, to be a loyalty partner with that MGM. So, we've called it a strategic licensing agreement because of some of those complexities. But in terms of the way we've structured the financial arrangements, you should think about it more through the lens of a more traditional franchise agreement structure. You're welcome. Go ahead. No, I was just going to say, yes, you're right, Richard. We're still down about three points on a global basis. But we see some real opportunities for growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we continue to see steady recovery on the business transient side, which gives us some optimism. And we continue to see continued recovery on cross-border travel, which gives us another layer of optimism. And then I would say, third, as I mentioned, in Greater China, which is our second largest market, you've still only got about a 40% recovery of cross-border airline capacity. And so in terms of inbound and outbound international travel related to China, we think there's some real opportunity for occupancy recovery there as well. And then, lastly, you've heard us talk about this the last couple of quarters, but we continue to see in the data real legs to this phenomenon of blended trip purpose and we think that's going to continue to drive occupancy, particularly in the days of the week that historically we considered shoulder days. Sure. So your characterization is accurate. The SMEs, which represent about 60% of our business transient segment, they were first fully recovered a quarter ago and their demand continues to be quite robust. The large corporate room nights continue to be recovering a bit more slowly. In Q1, we saw slow and steady recovery, and that continues to be the pace. What we hear from them anecdotally on, from one perspective, they continue to meet a great deal as they hire new staff, as they immerse them in their culture and do training meetings. And we think that's one of the drivers of the strength we're seeing in the group segment. Their international travel has been probably the slowest component of their travel to recover. And so it's a segment that we're monitoring closely, but it is certainly recovering more slowly than the SMEs. Yeah. And Dave, maybe just one clarification and additional comment. On the recovery of the SMEs, we saw them fully recover in Q1 of 2022, not 2023, just to make sure I'm precise. The other thing I will tell you is while the recovery of the large corporates has been not as rapid as what we've seen with the SMEs, we do see strong enough demand even with the large corporates that it is giving us pretty good pricing power. As we talked about a couple of quarters ago, and one of the underpinnings of the rate growth we saw in the quarter was our ability to negotiate high single-digit special corporate rates for 2023. And as we start in earnest to go into corporate rate negotiations for 2024, we have every expectation that we will be emerging from that rate negotiation season, having achieved high single-digit rate negotiated rates for the second straight year. You're welcome. Yes. Good question, Bill. I'd point to a few things and maybe I'll try to answer you going segment by segment. I talked in my prepared remarks about the leisure segment being up in the quarter 10%. One of the things that was really encouraging to me in the leisure segment was that, that 10% improvement was split almost perfectly evenly by both occupancy and rate improvement. We saw a 5% improvement in ADR, which I thought was quite encouraging. Similarly -- and that was a global number. Pivoting to the US, which I think was your question. In the US and Canada, we talked a little bit about group. Some of the pricing power we're seeing in group as evidenced by the revenue pace we're seeing, not only in the back half of 2023, where we're pacing up 11% in revenue, but also where we're seeing in 2024, where we're now pacing up 14%, which is already up 5 points just three months since the last time we talked to you about group pace. And then as you heard from Leeny, when she was asking one of the earlier questions about business transient, you have 6% ADR growth in business transient in the US and Canada, which I think is another data point. When you throw all that in the blender together, all of that gives us some comfort that there is some opportunity. The only thing, I would say to you, and you heard Leeny referenced this, we do expect year-over-year ADR to moderate a bit given some of the comparisons, particularly as we get into year three -- or excuse me, Q3 and Q4 but we do expect ADR to continue to grow through the back half of the year. Sure. So let me talk maybe a little bit about China, and then I'll let Leeny do the balance of the tour around the world. I talked in my prepared remarks about how encouraged we are about the recovery in China and the fact that Greater China as a market surpassed pre-pandemic RevPAR in the quarter. And it was able to achieve those results principally on the shoulders of domestic demand given some of the stats that I shared on the relatively modest recovery of international airline capacity. One of the stats that was really encouraging to me, if you look at Q2 RevPAR in Greater China, we were up almost 125% to last year. I think that speaks to the strength and pace of recovery in that market, but it also speaks to the quality of our distribution particularly in the major markets like Beijing and Shanghai. Leeny, you want to maybe talk a little about APAC and EMEA? Go ahead, Leeny. Sure. So I think there's three questions in there, I'll try to hit all three, Robin. On the first one, as Leeny mentioned, while we're not going to disclose the specific deal terms, this is structured very similar to a franchise agreement where we are receiving a royalty fee on rooms revenue. This is not as Leeny termed it, an a\u0300 la carte, where we're only getting paid on fees generated just through our proprietary channels. So I do think you should think about it through the lens of a more traditional franchise fee structure. On your second question, we typically do conversions, pending opening in our system are typically included as rooms under construction because they typically have some measure of property improvement plan, improvements and construction before they come into our system. Even in the case of MGM with extraordinary quality assets, there are, for instance, some life safety improvements and some other physical improvements that are required to those assets before they will be plugged into the system. And that's why they're characterized in that way. And on your third question, I'm doing the math just in my brain so we can do it more precisely for you. But if you take the quarter end pipeline and you back out those numbers or back out the MGM, we would have been a little over 500,000 rooms in the pipeline. And if you back the MGM numbers out of the under construction, we would have been a little over 200,000. So, it would have been 40%-ish under construction versus the 30% that you referenced. And so in terms of implications going forward, I'd reference a response I gave you maybe a quarter ago, which is for, I don't recall the precise number, but 20-some-odd quarters despite really strong openings we've continued consistently to have plus or minus 20,000 rooms under construction globally, which I don't think bodes quite well for our continued recovery to mid-single-digit net unit growth. In the pipeline, yes, we are in the 547,000, yes. So that would include -- to be more precise, that would include the roughly 37,000 incremental rooms that will come in, not the full 40,000 because the Cosmopolitan is already open and operating in the system as an Autograph as we sit here today. Sure. Of course. So, maybe I'll sort of go in sequence. We are seeing a very encouraging uptick in the pace of development inquiries, a parallel uptick in the number of signed MOUs and then parallel committee submissions and approvals. As you'll recall from some of our previous conversations, oftentimes, unlike many other markets around the world, new construction hotels often come into our development process when those structures are well under construction as opposed to a US deal where it might come to us as a greenfield site. Many of those under construction buildings had been paused during the pandemic. We have seen parallel encouraging restart of many of those construction projects. So when we think about each of the milestones in the development of a hotel project or the life cycle of a hotel project, we're seeing encouraging uptick at every one of those milestones across Greater China. You're welcome Sure. So maybe I'll try at a high level, and then, Leeny, you might want to be a little more granular. Obviously, we think it's a huge win for our group customers. As you know, Michael, the way we sell group as we look at their multiyear rotational needs and for many of these particularly large groups, Las Vegas is always in their multiyear plan. While we had the ability to offer them the Cosmopolitan, the breadth of offerings we can now make available to them, particularly the largest of those groups that need very significant meeting space, we think we've got a terrific opportunity to keep them within the Marriott Group ecosystem much more effectively. Our sales teams will be collaborating closely, the Marriott and the MGM sales teams, to ensure we capture as much of that demand as possible. In terms of markets that might be impacted by that, most of those groups are rotating through Las Vegas as a destination anyway. And so I don't think we're deeply concerned that groups going there will be at the expense of those destinations. We just think we have a better probability of capturing that Las Vegas rotation within the Marriott ecosystem. Great. Well, thank you all for your interest this morning. I wish you safe travels, and we look forward to seeing all of you in Miami this September. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our strong second quarter results reflected solid demand in ADR growth around the world with Greater China RevPAR more than doubling, international RevPAR rose an impressive 39% over the 2022 second quarter. Occupancy for our international regions reached 68%, a 12 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter and ADR increased 14%. RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada grew 6% versus the year ago quarter. Occupancy reached 74%, up 1 percentage point, while ADR increased 4%. While demand from both business and leisure guests remained strong, growth rates are stabilizing as we return to more normalized year-over-year comparisons. Total company's gross fee revenues totaled $1.25 billion, rising 16%, led by meaningful growth in incentive management fees or IMF. IMF totaled $193 million in the quarter, with fees in Greater China up significantly, given the strong recovery in that region. Impressively, our IMF in the first half of 2023 were 19% higher than peak IMF in the first half of 2018. Our owned, leased and other revenue net of direct expenses grew 24% despite lower termination fees, largely due to improved performance at our owned and leased hotels. Our strong IMF and owned, leased performance demonstrate our operating team's terrific work at driving profitability. Corporate G&A rose to 4%, well-above the rate of top line growth with the strong operating leverage inherent in our business, adjusted EBITDA reached a record $1.2 billion, up an impressive 20% year-over-year. On the development front, we're closely monitoring the financing environment, which remains tight around the world. While the US and Europe are facing the most lending challenges, even in these markets, financing has not come to a standstill. Over the past few months, many owners in these regions have been able to secure financing and begin construction. In most of our other regions, there's much less dependence on debt financing for new deals, so hotel construction generally continues apace. Properties in our industry leading 547, 000 room pipeline that are already under construction continue to move forward. And we've not seen the number of deals leaving the pipeline increase. Global fallout in the quarter was 1.3%, below our historic quarterly average of just over 2%. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings release. With the better than expected second quarter results and robust global booking trends, especially internationally, we're raising our full year guidance. While there is still a level of macroeconomic uncertainty, as we look into the third quarter, the consumer is generally holding up well and our forward bookings remain solid. In the US, it now seems more likely that the US economy could have a soft landing. Our updated guidance range assumes relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand. Growth is expected to remain higher internationally than in the US and Canada, where we're seeing a return to more normal seasonal patterns and year-over-year RevPAR growth is stabilizing. For the full year, we now expect 7% to 9% RevPAR growth in the US and Canada. We're raising our expectation for international RevPAR growth to 28% to 30%, leading to an expected 12% to 14% increase in global RevPAR. Total fees for the full year could rise between 16% and 18% with the non-RevPAR related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR related fees are expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect 2023 G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 level. Compared to 2022, full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 18% and 21% and adjusted EPS could rise 25% to 29%. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a large amount of cash. In the first half of this year, our net cash provided by operating activities surpassed $1.5 billion, nearly 50% higher than the same period last year. We've returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through June. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion to shareholders in 2023. This assumes full year investment spending of $900 million to $1 billion, which includes the $100 million spent on the acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio. With our major technology transformation, we will also have elevated technology spending this year and over the next few years, though this investment is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. Thank you for your interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to answer your questions. Yes. No, we've got several years left on them, Stephen, and are really pleased with the continued growth in the credit card fees, and frankly, really particularly pleased with adding so many new countries. So I think when you look at credit card fees for the year, I think, broadly speaking, a double-digit growth rate is right. Now for total non-RevPAR fees, we've talked about a 4% to 7% growth in non-RevPAR fees because of the lumpiness of things like residential fees. And the reality, as you remember, our timeshare fees are overwhelmingly a flat payment that go up only slightly. So overall, I think we're looking at 4% to 7%. But again, on the credit card side, we continue to see really strong growth. Stephen, the only thing I'll add -- Stephen, the only thing I'll add to that is the reality that at the end of the day, we do believe that it is the person-to-person and the experiential part of our business that makes it so unique. So being able to use generational AI in a way that enhances that service, we see as a real benefit, but never to take away from the fundamental people-to-people part of our business. Right. Good morning. So Shaun, the only other thing that I would add is the reality that you've heard us talk more and more about multiunit conversions, which does make things a little bit lumpier on the rooms growth. If you remember, when we added a big slug of all-inclusive rooms a couple of years ago, when you look at the MGM deal that we recently announced, I take your point that M&A would be looked at separately. But I do think on the conversion side, you should continue to see us chasing these lovely multi-unit conversion opportunities that can bounce the numbers around a little bit, but definitely give us confidence in our mid-single-digit net rooms growth number as we look forward. Hey, Joe. So Joe, we can work through the per room. Obviously, we've got the reality that the system overall is about 11% bigger than it was in 2019. So those comparisons start to be a little bit less meaningful. But to your point about where IMF should be for the full year, I think what you've seen in what we reported today clearly points to the reality that we hope, assuming things continue the way our guidance predicts, is a number of IMF that exceeds our 2019 peak by a good amount. The amount of percentage of hotels earning incentive fees so far is 62% in Q2 versus 72% in 2019. So we're clearly getting much closer. And in Asia Pacific, it's in the mid-80s in both years. So I think it -- as you know, we've got a different structure of IMF in Asia Pacific. And as our growth has been outsized in that region, they have a very positive quality of behaving much more like base fees. So I think you should continue to see strong growth there. In Q2, we were looking at about 41% coming from the US and Canada and 30% coming from Asia Pacific. So we're getting much closer to our 2019 proportion of incentive fees. And again, as we talked about before, when we look for the rest of the year, we do see the reality that we expect IMF to be higher than our peak. So, I'll-- No, you go, Tony. The only thing I'll add, David, is that on the special corporate rate, I think it is worth noting that you've heard us talk before that we got nearly double-digit increases in negotiated rate this year. And as we look out to next year, we do -- we're starting to have those conversations and we are looking for an additional meaningful increase next year as well. And while you're right that the classic big four and tech firms are still down in night meaningfully compared to 2019, overall business transient is up compared to 2019 and we are continuing to see some recovery. So we do eventually think that it will get back to levels that we saw in 2019 on the special corporate side eventually. And again, overall business transient is doing well from a revenue perspective. Yes, sure. So just real quickly, overall, mid-50s for Bonvoy penetration, low 60s for U.S. and Canada. And when you look at -- we are still kind of mid-70s for direct contribution -- direct channel contribution for our bookings, and the OTA is 11% to 12%. So again, fairly stable. The main point is that our -- when you think about the digital channels, they have gained meaningfully more share over the past several years than the OTAs and grown very nicely. And when you look just kind of one last data point for you, when you think about redemptions as a percentage of our total room nights, it's 6%. And digital is mid-30s. Sure. All of the above. You've got great news in terms of adding cardholders. That is obviously a critical component to this, is adding additional cardholders. And we're very pleased with adding additional cardholders. And then obviously, it's the average spend on those existing cardholders. So as you see growth in those two, you get the growth in credit card, but just as importantly, is adding new countries. So when we add South Korea, Japan or China, it really opens up a new market that goes from zero to thousands of cards with growth potential that goes off many years into the future. And we are continuing to add additional countries. So we'll talk more in September about kind of how to think about that in a three-year model. But as I said, for this year, I think you can be looking at them for overall total credit card branding fees to be in about the roughly 10% range. Well, thanks. We appreciate the support. So I'll start -- I'll start, Tony, and then you jump in. I think you've heard us talk about our entry into the affordable mid-scale space since the acquisition of City Express in CALA and with our conversation about MidX Studios, which is a mid-scale extended stay product that we're very excited about in the US and are having great conversations with owners. And really, we look at that around the world as providing great opportunities for us in addition to growing all of our other brands. I mean I think it's important to note that we think there's lots of room for us to have growth across all segments around the world and our existing brands. But for example, we're excited about what we see as the possibility for a conversion mid-scale brand in EMEA and look forward to some announcements in the back half of the year regarding that. So we'll continue to look to try to meet our customers' needs and expand our distribution in a way that strengthens Bonvoy. Sure. And I think a lot of this is just about acceleration of recovery. So if you think about it, it's a little bit hard to predict exactly how airlift is going to go and how cross-border travel and how a country is going to emerge from the pandemic. And so I think the reality is that the recovery in China has come faster than we expected. And cross-border, while it is still meaningfully lower in China than it was pre-COVID, we've got international airlift only at 40% of pre-COVID level. So there's clearly more room to go. There's no doubt that as that country has rebounded. And as the rest of Asia Pacific has also really opened its borders completely, we've seen that all of the travel there has picked up very fast. So when I kind of go back to where at the beginning of the year, where you might have imagined Greater China and Asia Pacific outside of China, they are both up the most. I think the only other comment I would make is that, obviously, Europe this summer has dramatically outperformed expectations. And we continue to see really strong demand in Caribbean and Latin America and Middle East Africa. So international really benefiting from all the cross-border travel. And frankly, from a global economy that has probably been a bit stronger than everyone anticipated at the beginning of the year. Sure. So... As you say, we're not going to get into the details of the calculation, but it is based on hotel revenues. So it is not an a\u0300 la carte sort of deal. Yes. The deal was signed before June 30. So, it's appropriate that it was in -- it was not announced until a few weeks ago, but it was signed."

We announced excellent first quarter results, reflecting continued momentum in our business around the world. While the timing of demand recovery has varied across regions, depending on COVID policies, it is clear that post-pandemic people have a deep appreciation for travel. As the largest global lodging company, with properties in 138 countries and territories, a diverse portfolio of amazing brands and our award-winning Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, we are proud to connect people through the power of travel. First quarter global RevPAR rose 34% versus 2022, driven by significant recovery in Asia Pacific and strong growth across the rest of our regions. Worldwide occupancy reached 65%, up 11 percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. Global ADR grew 11%, demonstrating our continued focus on driving rate. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, it has not weighed on travel demand to date. In fact, demand continued to rise across all customer segments in the quarter. Forward bookings are solid. Though our transient booking window is still short term at around three weeks, so trends could change relatively quickly. Global leisure demand and ADR are still incredibly robust. Following a year with leisure demand already well above pre-pandemic levels, first quarter transient room nights for the segment increased 12% with ADR rising 8% year-over-year. Group demand was also very strong in the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, group revenue for full year 2023 was pacing up 26% to 2022 at the end of the quarter, a significant improvement from group pace at the end of last year. For the second through fourth quarter of this year, group room nights were pacing up 9% with rate up 7%, leading to revenues pacing up 16% year-over-year. U.S. and Canada business transient demand saw a modest additional recovery in the quarter. ADR rose meaningfully primarily due to solid special corporate rate increases. First quarter U.S. and Canada business transient revenues surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. And [for] cross-border travel has continued to rise globally. However, it is still a few 100 basis points below 2019 when guests traveling abroad accounted for nearly 20% of total room nights. Additional upside is expected to come primarily from Asia Pacific given international airlift to and from China is still well below pre-pandemic levels. We are focused on strengthening our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty platform by continuing to grow our membership base, which reached 182 million members at the end of March and enhancing engagement with these valuable customers. Our co-branded credit cards with offerings in nine countries performed well again this quarter. Global Card acquisitions sorted 35% year-over-year while global card spend increased 16%. To engage with our customers, we are increasingly leveraging our digital platforms which are highly profitable channels for our owners. Those digital channels had a record first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, mobile app users grew 31%, digital room nights rose 17% and digital revenues climbed 26%. Turning to development. We still expect gross rooms growth of around 5.5% this year and net rooms growth of 4% to 4.5%. While we are keeping a close eye on the financing environment, as Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we do anticipate returning to a mid-single-digit net rooms growth in the next few years. We were pleased to close the City Express transaction just yesterday, welcoming roughly 17,000 rooms in the Caribbean and Latin American region, or CALA, into our portfolio. City Express is an incredible launchpad to jumpstart our entry into the high-growth moderately priced mid-scales. We see meaningful opportunity to expand the brand in CALA as well as in other locations around the world. Our industry-leading pipeline stood at approximately 502,000 rooms at quarter end, with 57% of those rooms in international markets and about 200,000 rooms under construction. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multiunit opportunities. Conversions represented nearly 30% of signings in the quarter and 25% of openings. I'll now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results reflected robust demand growth around the world with all regions and all hotel tiers posting solid performance. U.S. and Canada RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year; occupancy reached 66%, up 8 percentage points, while ADR rose 10% versus the year ago quarter. International RevPAR rose a remarkable 63% over the '22 first quarter with ADR rising 16%. Occupancy reached 64%, an 18 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter. Demand was strong in all international markets with particularly impressive improvement in Asia Pacific after travel restrictions were lifted. RevPAR in Greater China was 95% recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and Mainland China was more than fully recovered. This is all the more notable given that demand in the quarter was overwhelmingly driven by domestic travelers as international airlift was still less than 20% of 2019 capacity at the end of March. As you will recall, around one quarter of room nights in Greater China were from international guests pre-pandemic. International flights to and from China are slowly being adding, although airlift is only expected to be around 40% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. Total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, nearly 40% above the prior year quarter with a meaningful rise in incentive management fees, or IMF. IMF nearly doubled compared to 2022 to $201 million. They also topped the first quarter of 2019 by 23%, with every region except for Greater China, earning more incentive fees than in the 2019 first quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees also grew meaningfully once again totaling $197 million, up 16% year-over-year, primarily due to co-branded credit card fees rising 18%. Containing cost remains a focus at both the corporate and the hotel level. In the U.S. and Canada, margins at our managed hotels rose two percentage points versus the 2022 first quarter, and they remain above 2019 margin levels. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.1 billion, a new quarterly record despite the first quarter being the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. With the better-than-expected first quarter results and robust global booking trends, we're raising our full year guidance. Macroeconomic uncertainty is not impacting our short-term demand and trends across all customer segments remain strong. The second quarter is expected to benefit from particularly strong year-over-year growth in international markets, especially in Asia Pacific. However, there is less visibility in forecasting the company's financial performance for the second half of the year. The high end of the range reflects relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand across all customer segments and markets. The low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy in the second half of the year with worldwide RevPAR in the last two quarters, roughly flat compared to 2022. For the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could grow 6% to 9% and international RevPAR could grow 22% to 25%, leading to global RevPAR rising 10% to 13%. Total fees for the full year could rise between 13% and 16% with a non-RevPAR-related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 13% and 18%, and adjusted EPS could rise 19% to 26% above 2022. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a great deal of cash. In the first quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was around $890 million, and we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through the end of March. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. For the full year, we still expect 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million through the just completed acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio as well as higher-than-typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion to shareholders in 2023. On the development front, we are sure many of you have questions about the banking environment in the U.S. and in Europe, in particular. Given rapidly rising interest rates, the financing environment in these regions has been challenging for some time. Another element of uncertainty has now been added as some banks wait for more clarity around capital requirements and perhaps additional regulations. However, while there are challenges with lending, especially for new construction projects, deals that have committed financing continue to move forward. Additionally, the number of deals leading the pipeline is not increasing. Fallout in the quarter was around 1.5% below our historical average of just over 2%. We're closely monitoring the situation and the regulatory response but we do expect the tightening in hotel financing to be short term. As we have seen over time, hotel financing has proven to be quite resilient over the long term. Hotel loans have been among the better-performing sectors of commercial real estate lending of late as hotels continue to post excellent operating results. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony, who has a few more comments before we go to Q&A.\nTony Capuano: Thanks, Leeny. Before we open up for questions, I just want to pause for a moment and thank our team of associates around the world who continue to do such outstanding work and are a key reason that our year is off to such a strong start. They are remarkable. I'm also excited to let you all know that we plan to hold our first Analyst Day since early 2019 at the W South Beach in Miami on Wednesday, September 27. We will open registration for that event in June. And we look forward to seeing you in South Florida and sharing a deeper dive on our business with you this fall. So now Lenny and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, guys. What's that to us was obviously the -- I mean it was a good quarter overall. What's that to us was the incentive management fee performance in 1Q. And the comment you made that it was driven or IMF outside of China or above 2019 levels, China just below. Can you talk about China IMF expectations for the balance of this year and how you think about IMF growth relative to these and franchise and other fees growth?\nLeeny Oberg: Thanks. Sure. So let me just kind of set the stage a little bit, and that is that you -- we talked about the fact that IMF's essentially doubled Q1 over Q1. And certainly, a huge part of that was driven by Asia Pacific in their great RevPAR recovery. So again, broadly speaking, if you call it, $100 million increase in IMF, about $30 million to $40 million of that came from Asia Pacific. So definitely with a disproportionate increase in RevPAR relative to the rest of the world, they were a big provider. As you know, Joe, generally, our incentive fees in Asia Pacific do not include an owner's priority. So they tend to be not quite as lumpy in terms of the way that they return. So we would expect, as you see incentive fees for the remainder of this year, to continue to show that characteristic. And I guess the best way to put it is that if we hit the high end of our guidance, you could expect to see incentive fees globally actually surpass the peak levels that we had in 2019. And then the only other thing that I'll point out is that, obviously, our managed rooms, which make up about 550,000 rooms out of 1.5 million, over 75% of them are full-service rooms. So as you see the strength in both group and returning business transient and continued leisure demand, I think that bodes well for IMF.\nTony Capuano: And then, Leeny, the only thing I might add for Joe's benefits since his question was specific to China, we did see in the quarter, Joe, that Mainland China RevPAR was fully recovered to 2019 levels. But remember, the vast majority of that recovery was domestic demand. At the end of the quarter, only about 20% of the international airlift in China has recovered. I think by April, it was recovered about 40%. And so we do expect a stronger and stronger return of international demand in China through the balance of the year.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question -- Leeny, thank you for prepared remarks on the development front with potential financing challenges. Are you guys getting increased requests? Or do you anticipate increased requests from developers for financial support?\nLeeny Oberg: No, I think we always get requests for financial support, and we're happy to consider them. I do think, Joe, at the end of the day, the largest area of the capital stack, particularly in the U.S. that needs to be filled, is the senior loan. And so from that perspective, that is not a place where we typically get requests. And so around the edges, I would say there's a bit more request for whether they're debt service guarantees or operating profit guarantees, and that obviously is for managed properties. But I would say that, broadly speaking, the level of capital that we're putting into deals has not changed meaningfully. That this really is more about a temporary slowdown in the bank's willingness to get some of these financings over the finish line.\nJoe Greff: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hi, good morning. Wanted to touch base on the digital or technology investment that you talked about last quarter. Just want to know a little bit more about how you think that could impact the consumer experience and our employee experience as we think about longer-term revenue and/or margin implications from that investment?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So as we think about not only the re-platforming of our major systems but also ongoing investment in our technology infrastructure, we always think about it through the lens of the impact on our associates, our guests and our owners and franchisees. I think from an associate perspective, particularly our future workforce is a workforce that has grown up opening an iPhone box with the understanding that there are no instructions and that, that technology will be intuitive and the design of our future technology will be similarly intuitive. So we think it will both be advantageous as we compete for talent, but it will also create capacity for them to more deeply engage with our guests. For our guests, we envision both at the property level and our customer engagement centers, making the breadth of information that we have about our guests available to our agents so that they can quickly and seamlessly address whatever questions or concerns or needs that those guests have. And then I think from the owner's perspective, there are both inherent operating efficiencies from new technologies that should be margin enhancing. And I also think from a revenue generation perspective, today, when you go to m.com you have the ability to book rooms. When our new systems roll out, the full breadth of products and services that we have to sell our customers, food beverage, spa, golf will be available at a single click. And we think that represents a very meaningful revenue upside.\nLeeny Oberg: And Stephen, the only thing that I'll add is just a reminder that this is really a multiyear process that -- we talked about it a quarter ago, we talked about it again today, and that is that, I mean, we're thrilled with what we see for the potential with this and that, that will impact this year's investment spending, but we expect this will take several years.\nStephen Grambling: That's helpful. And perhaps a quick follow-up on Joe's question about development and really focused on the pipeline. Given the strong growth in international markets in China, in particular, in the pipeline, how does that change the visibility as we think about translating to net unit growth from that particular part of the pipeline?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, the continued strength in conversions is obviously great for our visibility into the pipeline. They tend to be shorter to actually open, they tend to be clearer and exactly what needs to be done to be able to put our flag on them. And you've seen that we continue to put out really strong numbers on both signings and openings. The other trend that we've noticed over the past couple of years is increasing comfort internationally with conversions. And as you think about our soft brands, that really started, frankly, in the U.S. with Autograph and then have now really expanded as you think about Autograph Luxury collection tribute and to some extent, Delta, you really see those spreading more around the world. And that obviously gives us better visibility both for the rooms that are going to open and frankly, really helps support the net rooms growth thesis that we have.\nTony Capuano: And I might just build on that, Stephen, the -- we talked a little bit about this last quarter. Of course, the teams around the world continue to pursue individual asset conversions, but we are just as aggressively looking for portfolio conversions. You might remember that in the middle of last year we were delighted to announce an 8-hotel portfolio conversion in Vietnam that we referred to as Vinpearl. Just last month, we did Vinpearl Round 2, which was seven additional hotels, about 2,500 rooms, three of which are conversions that will open in calendar 2023. So I think that multi-unit portfolio conversion strategy is something you should reasonably expect to continue to be a focus area for our teams.\nStephen Grambling: That's helpful context. Thanks so much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get just a little more color on how we think about the arc or trajectory of non-RevPAR fees relative to the core fees that you've obviously provided a ton of color on and arguably, we have a bit more experience modeling over the long term.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. I think you heard me talk about the 4% to 7% expectation for 2023, which is obviously a bit different as it relates to fees from RevPAR given what we're seeing in the lodging operations for the year. So I think overwhelmingly, as you know, the non-RevPAR fees are co-brand credit card fees. Those are the largest chunk. And they are going to tie to both the number of cardholders and the level of average spend. I think it won't surprise you that as you've seen people start to amount of COVID that we are seeing the average spend on credit card increases year-over-year moderate. But I will also say that the number of cardholders is growing very nicely. So I would say that it is relatively speaking, more growth coming from the increased base of cardholders than it is on the actual spend, but it is a great combination of the two of them. The other thing is on our resi fees, on our resi branding fees, they over a kind of three to five year time horizon, they've just been growing beautifully as there's great demand for that product of ours, but they are a bit lumpier in terms of when the actual residences open. And that, I think you should expect to see that it will continue to grow over time, but that it can vary quarter-to-quarter quite meaningfully given the onetime nature of those fees.\nDavid Katz: Understood. Very helpful. And if I can ask my follow-up, just touch on City Express a bit more, admitting that I have not stated one. Can you just help us sort of place that within kind of the RevPAR hierarchy of what you have? And give us a sense, as to sort of when and how and what way we might see that grow into other markets notably more in the U. S.?\nTony Capuano: Yes, of course. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, on the long list of attributes that excite us about this transaction, it is a great way for the company to enter the midscale segment, which is not a segment where we have competed previously. When we have talked in the past about the breadth of our portfolio, we've often responded to questions by saying we love the breadth of that portfolio for the way in which, it satisfies the wants and needs of both our guests and our owners and franchisees. And mid-scale is a tier where we hear demands from both of those constituents. Mid-scale obviously is - as from a RevPAR perspective and a rate positioning perspective, positioned below brands like Fairfield that are in our current architecture. We think there is an immediate opportunity to accelerate the growth of City Express across the Caribbean and Latin American region. As we have done with many brands that we've either developed organically or acquired. We are indeed been exploring the applicability of the City Express platform, and its growth potential in other markets around the world. And in fact here in the U. S., we're just a few weeks away from announcing a simple, modern, streamlined, new build, extended state product that has very basic services and amenities for those looking for longer stays at our mid-scale price point, and you should expect to hear more about that in the coming weeks.\nDavid Katz: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nTony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. Just circling back in your introductory remarks, you talked about business transient revenue being above 2019 levels. I wonder if you could tell us, because rate clearly seems to be the driver. What business transient nights are as kind of the percent change the delta to 2019 level?\nLeeny Oberg: So business transient room nights are down about 1% versus 2019. Obviously, the rate has been terrific, particularly with the most recent renegotiation at the special corporate rate.\nRobin Farley: Great, thank you. And I guess my other - the follow-up question would be I know you've talked about the strength you're raising RevPAR, so clearly you're seeing strong demand. But when we look at the broader market, the STR data, we see luxury and economy that the two sort of ends Both having kind of on a trailing at this point, I think it's seven weeks of trailing six to seven weeks of trailing showing down year-over-year for RevPAR for those two segments? And I realize you're much more focused than the upscale and upper upscale, but I wonder if you could just sort of like opine for a moment on whether that's something that you think will start to move into those other segments or how you view what's happening in those kind of upscale economy parts of the market? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Sure. So obviously, we're very focused on rate and I think that's revealed in the results with global ADR up about 11% in the quarter. If you look at the U.S. and Canada, Q1 luxury rates as you point out were down slightly year-over-year. But as we dig into that data, our sense is that modest decline is largely around mix shift. So the prior several quarters, the bulk of that luxury rate growth was in leisure destinations, resort destinations as we start to see pickup in demand in urban downtown core destinations. That's great for the business, but it's at lower rates and that's dragging down a bit. With that said, globally luxury ADR was up 4% in the quarter even as compared to the extraordinarily strong ADR we saw for luxury in the first quarter. And then, I think your second question was on?\nLeeny Oberg: On economy which largely as you might imagine, I think we don't play very much there really in any meaningful way. I think it's not a surprise when you see that just generally speaking in economy, there tends to be less variability both up and down over time than you see in the highest end rates. But I think again, I will point out on luxury, Robin that we're still very, very pleased with what we see in terms of luxury demand. And frankly, when you think, for example, people having more opportunities of where they want to travel. It's one of the benefits of being the size and scale of our system, because they're actually may not be going to some places domestically, that they were going before, but can now actually go abroad.\nTony Capuano: And then just to put a little more context to your question, Robin. And I think this kind of tracks with the industry data that you referenced. This is system wide for the quarter, we then as compared to '22 luxury RevPAR was up 18% extended stay RevPAR was up 16% select brand RevPAR was up 23% and premium RevPAR was up 35%.\nRobin Farley: Yes on that for year-over-year yes. Okay. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yes, thank you. You're welcome.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Leeny, maybe if we could talk about capital return a little bit. Obviously, you boosted up your expectations or outlook there. Could you just remind us sort of kind of maybe where this new outlook range kind of puts you relative to your medium-term leverage target and what that target is?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. I think it's a great question to be able to reinforce where we are, which is that we have been for some time continue to be and expect for the rest of this year to continue to be at the low end of the investment grade leverage targets. So the biggest chunk of all, of the chunk relative to the increase in capital return is from the increase in expected EBITDA and cash flow for the company. So if you think about broadly speaking, the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA going up between $250 million and $300 million, it's pretty straight math to see that that can get you to this increase of call it roughly $700 million of midpoint of capital return. So, we feel really strong about the way the business is operating, from a cash flow performance as well as the visibility that we've got, certainly in the near-term. But even at the lower end of the guidance that we provided, I think, we still feel really good about being at the low end of our leverage targets with the kind of capital return range that, we've given.\nShaun Kelley: Great. And as my follow-up to maybe switch gears a little bit, but following up on the comment around I think mid-scale extended stay and a little bit around M&A and City Express too. Tony, could just talk a little bit about sort of the balance of potential brand launches and where you see white space on that front relative to tuck-in M&A, which I know we saw for a number of years kind of back into the early 2010s and then obviously Starwood kind of took over for a few years in the late teens there? Maybe help us balance those two priorities or how you see opportunities in each?\nTony Capuano: Of course, so then the fundamental strategy has not shifted. You are right to point out that prior to Starwood, there was a fairly consistent cadence of what we always refer to as bolt-on acquisitions. But the bulk of those acquisitions had some common D&A. They often helped us gain a foothold in a geography where we were dissatisfied with the pace of organic growth. And they often - we often have the view that they represented a growth platform either regionally or potentially globally. AC acquisition would be perhaps the best illustration of that. Our industry leading scale gives us maybe the luxury of not needing to do M&A to gain scale. We enjoy scale. But we will continue to look at opportunities, if we believe there is a gap in the geography where our guests seek to travel and we're dissatisfied with our footprint or if we see a gap in our brand architecture. That was what guided the City Express transaction, a transaction that solidified the strength and leadership of our footprint in the CALA region and also filled in a gap our brand architecture by giving us entry into mid-scale. But the final bit of common D&A in every one of those transactions is the discipline around the valuation, and you should expect to see that same discipline as we evaluate. What I think will be a fair number of opportunities that will be floating around out, there in the market. And then maybe the last comment I would make is, as I reflect on the last decade or more of expansion of our platform. I'm delighted that we've expanded our brand architecture through a thoughtful blend of both M&A and organically generated platforms. When I look at the success, we've had with organic launches like Autograph and Moxy and I blend that with powerhouses like Residence Inn and Ritz-Carlton and AC which were added to the system through M&A., I really like that approach.\nShaun Kelley: Thanks very much.\nTony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi. Your line is now open.\nSmedes Rose: Hi thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit about, how you're thinking about occupancy as in you should hear. And I'm sort of asking in the context it looks like for you and for others, that we've seen reports from that occupancy just still sort of stubbornly below kind of pre-pandemic levels. I mean certainly, it's closed, but they're still below, obviously offset by rate? But I'm wondering do you have any just sort of updated thoughts on - is there some piece of business that's maybe kind of gone or people are being priced out or do you think occupancies can and will return to kind of pre-pandemic levels as we go through this year and into next year?\nTony Capuano: Sure. So I'll give it a try, and Leeny feel free to jump in. As we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we continue to see robust demand recovery translating into strong occupancy growth. In fact, on a global basis, we saw 11 points of occupancy improvement in the quarter. When we think about our updated guidance, at the high end of that guidance, we expect our RevPAR growth to be fairly evenly split between ADR and occupancy gains. So, we do expect there to be continued occupancy gains at the high end of that guidance. The low end of the range would, reflect a meaningful softening in the global economy in the back half of the year. And that would have worldwide RevPAR relatively flat, compared to where we were in the back half of last year.\nLeeny Oberg: So the only thing, I'll add is it is interesting when you look at occupancy compared to 2019, and we do continue to make progress in that comparison. When I look at U.S. and Canada kind of moving through from January through March of this Q compared to '19, we're down to only two percentage points, difference by the time we're at March. And globally, actually, we're only two percentage points in March as well. I think there are a couple of things to note. Number one is the portfolios are pretty different. We've added 11% more rooms since 2019. So the comparison starts to be not completely apples-to-apples. And I think there's, also been some great learnings on the part of the industry about revenue management. And there, I think at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that we're maximizing the returns on these real estate assets. And then as you've seen with group, for example, there's actually been some benefit over the reality that group is booking closer to the time of the actual event. So I think, we will eventually get back there. We are getting fairly close. But I think the best part is that you're seeing the fundamental business segments of business, transient leisure and group really all operating on full cylinders, not exactly the way they behaved in 2019, but still really in good shape.\nSmedes Rose: Okay thanks. And then maybe just on that - I'm sorry, if you said what percent of demand in the quarter came through Marriott ongoing members? And could you just talk a little bit about what kind of demand is coming through OTAs at this point?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. On the penetration side - is that your question on Marriott?\nSmedes Rose: Yes, yes right.\nLeeny Oberg: Are you talking about digital channels or are you talking about Marriott?\nSmedes Rose: Well for occupancy, how much came through Marriott bonds right like that?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. So for the first quarter, globally, the member penetration was 53% and in the U.S., it was 60%.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And has the - the occupancy through OTAs changed meaningfully or?\nLeeny Oberg: No, that has stayed that's at about 11%, and that is quite similar to what was pre-COVID. I think the interesting part is that you look at either the digital channels which have grown 600 basis points since pre-COVID or if you look at all of Marriott's direct channels together. We've actually grown share about 100 basis points since pre-COVID, but the OTAs have remained roughly flat.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you. I appreciate the details.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi, good morning everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nPatrick Scholes: Good morning Tony, I see there's some news in the last day or so that you folks will begin bundling your resort fees into your pricing displays later this month. It looks like you're the first major hotel company to be doing this. Do you see just putting yourself - does this create an unfair competitive disadvantage for you? And would you expect other hotel companies to also follow your lead with displaying these fees? Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Yes. So the way I'd answer that, Patrick, we've already been showing it. The discussions we've been having with the various jurisdictions are, just about making sure that the transparency of those disclosures is enhanced and crystal clear for our guests. It is not as if those were hidden somehow, we're simply further clarifying and enhancing that transparency. I will leave it to the state AGs around the rest of the country for the rest of the industry. But I am pleased, that we will lead the industry in terms of the transparency of our disclosure for our guests.\nPatrick Scholes: Thank you. And I also - I agree, I think that's the right thing to do to give full transparency on these. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Of course.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nRichard Clarke: Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. Just the first one, your comment was that the projects that are under construction or finance are not being affected. About 60% of your pipeline is not under construction. How would you clarify that? How much of that is finance of the construction has it started? And how much risk associated is there without 60% not under construction?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So yes, you've got the basic parameters roughly right, which is those that have started construction, you would expect those to be already be financed. There's not a specific number on firm financing for that other 60%. That's an ongoing process and always has been between the developers as they consider their various capital sources. One thing to remember in that is, that our pipeline is over 50% international, which does tend to be less dependent on senior loan financing. And then for the remainder, in the U.S., it is overwhelmingly limited service of franchised properties. And those from a relative speaking basis, we do believe that there is some slowdown in the pace of financing for those, but we are, at the same time, continuing to see that banks are willing to consider loans for strong brands and strong proven markets. And we are still seeing that lenders are looking at those projects. So, I don't think that there is a fundamental change in how we see those projects materializing and to actually build hotels. I'd also remind you that there's, quite a few conversion hotels in that as well. So I think, as you've probably seen in past times where lending has had a slowdown that there can be a bit of a slowdown and the construction starts. But that we do expect with the performance of the hotel business and frankly, the relative performance of hotel loans, particularly in limited service loans, we would expect that to get going again more quickly. We aren't seeing fall out of those deals from our pipeline in anything more than a typical fashion.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, thanks for that color. And just as a follow-up. You mentioned your credit cards now in nine countries, just how meaningfully are those eight non-U.S. countries so far. And what is the opportunity? Can we have a credit card in 200 countries eventually or is there some natural limit to how many countries you can launch it?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, we're certainly going to have as many as we can, you can be sure of that. I think I'd make two comments. First of all, certainly with the use of revolving credit in the U.S., that is by far, the lion's share of, the fees that we received are related to the U.S. But I would say the rate of growth that we're seeing in terms of both the, spend and the cardholder numbers in international is really quite tremendous. Both in terms of the numbers of cards - numbers of countries, that we're adding cards as well as the number of cardholders in those countries. So, we've been really pleased with the increases for example, in Japan, in South Korea, in terms of the growth in cardholders. And I think that bodes really well for future growth, but also for our hotel growth and for our hotel business, because these are all Bonvoy members who want to be earning points and staying at our properties. So it's a great part of the ecosystem of our business.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Dori Kesten with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDori Kesten: Thanks, good morning.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nDori Kesten: What percentage of your 200,000 rooms under construction are slated to open over the next three years?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, I think the best way - we don't have a particular percentage. As you know, we don't control exactly when they open. We do keep a very careful eye on how they are doing, and again, feel comfortable with the numbers that we've talked - that Tony talked about in terms of the gross room openings, which has both a share of those coming out from under construction as well as conversions.\nDori Kesten: Okay. And I guess on to conversions, do you know - do you have a typical percentage that come as a result of sales versus just an owner choosing to switch?\nTony Capuano: Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a typical percentage. If I had to guess over the last decade or so, it's probably relatively evenly split, between an owner that simply has an opportunity to change brands or to flag an independent hotel versus an opportunity that is, created as a result of a transaction. But I think that ebbs and flows a bit depending on where we find ourselves in an economic cycle.\nLeeny Oberg: And I'll just add one other point that may be as you try to come up with your own math, is just a reminder that for hotel construction and a limited service hotel is roughly speaking, two years under construction and a full-service hotel can be anywhere from three to four.\nDori Kesten: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandt Montour: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nBrandt Montour: Just quickly back to China Tony or anyone could you talk about maybe the starts momentum there on the ground. I know it sort of beats a little bit to its own drum or different drum than what we're talking about in the U.S., but are you seeing any building momentum in new construction starts in China? And do you think that, that could potentially offset sort of the growing headwinds on the financing side in the U.S. Lenny that you just talked about?\nTony Capuano: Yes. So I think the borders are just opening, the economy is just starting to really gear up. So it's a bit soon for new construction starts. What I can tell you is some of the in-flight construction projects that have been paused have restarted. Our approval volumes are accelerating, the volume of memorandums of understanding that we're negotiating and executing are accelerating. So all of the leading indicators that should drive construction starts are really encouraging, but probably a bit premature to have any really strong data for you.\nLeeny Oberg: The other thing I'll point out is that roughly speaking, about 15% of our Chinese pipeline deals have some state-owned enterprise participation. And I think that does help as you think about the capital sourcing for those projects that is helpful as we get those ongoing again.\nTony Capuano: And maybe the last point I would add, because we're so heavily weighted to the most valuable quality tiers of our upscale and luxury, oftentimes when we engage with the owner, the project is well under construction. So unlike the U.S., where our conversations start with a greenfield site, they may come to us with a tower of 25 stories out of the ground. So it's a bit of an apples to orange comparison.\nBrandt Montour: That's really helpful. And then, Leeny, following up on the IMF discussion, you talked about Asia-Pac and international. Could you maybe touch on the outlook for IMF in the U.S. kind of squaring that with the fact that you guys aren't implying a ton of growth in the U.S. in the back half? But as you mentioned, your mix skews to full service, which has the group component in there. Can you try and sort of square those factors away for us, please?\nLeeny Oberg: Yes, sure. Absolutely. So I do -- if you look at year-over-year Q1, you are right in pointing out that the U.S. IMF, which came close to doubling in Q1 from 42 to 85, actually did double, that growth was overwhelmingly driven by the premium hotels was the return of group and business transient to our premium hotels. We did continue to see growth in IMF from our luxury hotels, but the biggest chunk of growth came from those premium hotels. So I think with the strength of group that Tony pointed out, in his comments for the rest of the year that you should continue to see the strong growth in both U.S. and Canada IMFs as well as international.\nBrandt Montour: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi, thank you. Good morning. Just with respect to China, I understand that the recovery has been primarily domestic so far, and we obviously have a good feel for airlift recovery. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about segmentation. Is it like other geographies in that it's primarily leisure at this stage? And could you just comment on BT and group recovery within China or if there's any differences versus other geographies? And then just for my follow-up for the sake of time, do you share the view that it will be a fairly booming summer to Europe looking forward? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So I'll start with the second question first, and then Tony will fill in also. And that is, yes, on the second question. While we actually have seen the dollar soften a little bit more than where we were relative to when we gave guidance earlier in February, the reality is that we are still seeing great demand for Europe hotels for the summer and very pleased with the booking patterns we see there. On Greater China, let me talk about a couple of things. First of all, cross-border, just a reminder of our comments earlier that roughly three quarters of the business typically is domestic. Well, right now, it's over 90% is domestic. So I think there is the reality that there's going to be more travel both in and out of Greater China as demand -- as the airlift improve. So we would expect to see that help both other parts of the world, but also that there's more travel into China. In terms of the segment, it's seeing the recovery in segments very similar to the way that we saw it in other parts of the world. The one difference being that on special corporate and business transient in China that is recovering much more quickly than it did in the U.S. For example, overwhelmingly, people are back in their offices in Greater China, while in the U.S., there's obviously much more of a hybrid mix. So we are actually seeing all of the segments recover more in line with each other rather than necessarily one after another the way it was in the U.S.\nTony Capuano: And the only other small note I would make, and I'm sure you're aware of this, with Chinese government just pivoted a bit and said that those foreign visas issued prior to March 28 of '20, that initially, they have said would need to be renewed, those are now available for use for entry into Mainland China, which should pave the way for greater inbound international because of the queue for new visa processing for international visitors had been quite lengthy.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Really interesting. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Welcome.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, Tony, in terms of what your team has [coined blazer], which has presumably helped the length of stay, I'd assume, upper upscale in luxury. While it's hard to pinpoint, have you seen any reduction in these hybrid trips? I know it's always tough to analyze that, but just trying to figure out as people get back to fully in the office if that benefit has waned at all? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yes. Not yet. I mean I think the best statistical data we have is the recovery by day of the week, and we continue to see strong recovery on Sundays and Thursdays, which is probably the most compelling empirical data we have that suggests that blended trip purpose continues to be strong. And then I would supplement that data with what we hear anecdotally when we're talking both with special corporate customers and with group customers who are talking to us as we re-platform our technology and encouraging us to make it easier for their business travelers or their group meeting attendees to book a single reservation that has both business and leisure purposes. So our sense is that, that trend shows no sign of slowing down. And as I've said in other forums, that's great news for our business.\nChad Beynon: Thank you. And then lastly, and this is something you'll probably get into at the Analyst Day. But Leeny, in terms of the guidance you laid out, the difference between the high- and low-end, obviously, regarding variable scenarios and prior global recessions or in the analysis you guys are currently doing for the guidance, should we expect a more pronounced flattening or maybe decline in North America or outside of the U.S.? Obviously, a lot of variables in there, but just kind of wondering how you're thinking about maybe a soft landing or slightly worse than soft landing could affect each market. Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yes. I would probably consider it about the timing of the recovery. So a couple of broad comments. Generally speaking, lodging demand does have a high correlation with GDP growth. So when you think of emerging economies like India, as an example, where you're seeing 6% GDP growth, that's going to be very different than what you see in the U.S. where more typical GDP growth might be more like 2%, and so the impact of a recession can be different in that regard. But I think when I think about the guidance that we've given this year, it is much more tied to the pace of recovery. The U.S., for example, meaningfully farther along in its recovery from COVID than Asia Pacific, for example. And I think we're clearly seeing that now all restrictions are lifted in Asia Pacific and that both pent-up demand and return of demand is coming quite nicely, which will mean that should we see an economic slowdown, I think they will be impacted a bit less than, for example, in the U.S., where obviously in the U.S., if we see it, it's starting from a different point. So again, as we talked about, we would imagine that Q3 and Q4 and that slowdown does mean that there is a meaningful economic slowdown. I'm not sure I would call it a super sharp deep V. But clearly, a real meaningful economic slowdown that would get us to that roughly flat RevPAR in Q3 and Q4 compared to '22.\nChad Beynon: Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Tony Capuano for closing remarks.\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you all again for your thoughtful questions. Thanks for your interest in Marriott International. We hope to accommodate you in what should be a terrific summer around the world. And we look forward to welcoming all of you to the beach in Miami in the fall for our Investor Day. Have a great afternoon. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time. Have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We announced excellent first quarter results, reflecting continued momentum in our business around the world. While the timing of demand recovery has varied across regions, depending on COVID policies, it is clear that post-pandemic people have a deep appreciation for travel. As the largest global lodging company, with properties in 138 countries and territories, a diverse portfolio of amazing brands and our award-winning Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, we are proud to connect people through the power of travel. First quarter global RevPAR rose 34% versus 2022, driven by significant recovery in Asia Pacific and strong growth across the rest of our regions. Worldwide occupancy reached 65%, up 11 percentage points higher than the year ago quarter. Global ADR grew 11%, demonstrating our continued focus on driving rate. While macroeconomic uncertainty persists, it has not weighed on travel demand to date. In fact, demand continued to rise across all customer segments in the quarter. Forward bookings are solid. Though our transient booking window is still short term at around three weeks, so trends could change relatively quickly. Global leisure demand and ADR are still incredibly robust. Following a year with leisure demand already well above pre-pandemic levels, first quarter transient room nights for the segment increased 12% with ADR rising 8% year-over-year. Group demand was also very strong in the quarter. In the U.S. and Canada, group revenue for full year 2023 was pacing up 26% to 2022 at the end of the quarter, a significant improvement from group pace at the end of last year. For the second through fourth quarter of this year, group room nights were pacing up 9% with rate up 7%, leading to revenues pacing up 16% year-over-year. U.S. and Canada business transient demand saw a modest additional recovery in the quarter. ADR rose meaningfully primarily due to solid special corporate rate increases. First quarter U.S. and Canada business transient revenues surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began. And [for] cross-border travel has continued to rise globally. However, it is still a few 100 basis points below 2019 when guests traveling abroad accounted for nearly 20% of total room nights. Additional upside is expected to come primarily from Asia Pacific given international airlift to and from China is still well below pre-pandemic levels. We are focused on strengthening our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty platform by continuing to grow our membership base, which reached 182 million members at the end of March and enhancing engagement with these valuable customers. Our co-branded credit cards with offerings in nine countries performed well again this quarter. Global Card acquisitions sorted 35% year-over-year while global card spend increased 16%. To engage with our customers, we are increasingly leveraging our digital platforms which are highly profitable channels for our owners. Those digital channels had a record first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, mobile app users grew 31%, digital room nights rose 17% and digital revenues climbed 26%. Turning to development. We still expect gross rooms growth of around 5.5% this year and net rooms growth of 4% to 4.5%. While we are keeping a close eye on the financing environment, as Leeny will discuss in her remarks, we do anticipate returning to a mid-single-digit net rooms growth in the next few years. We were pleased to close the City Express transaction just yesterday, welcoming roughly 17,000 rooms in the Caribbean and Latin American region, or CALA, into our portfolio. City Express is an incredible launchpad to jumpstart our entry into the high-growth moderately priced mid-scales. We see meaningful opportunity to expand the brand in CALA as well as in other locations around the world. Our industry-leading pipeline stood at approximately 502,000 rooms at quarter end, with 57% of those rooms in international markets and about 200,000 rooms under construction. Strong interest in conversions continues, including multiunit opportunities. Conversions represented nearly 30% of signings in the quarter and 25% of openings. I'll now turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Leeny. Before we open up for questions, I just want to pause for a moment and thank our team of associates around the world who continue to do such outstanding work and are a key reason that our year is off to such a strong start. They are remarkable. I'm also excited to let you all know that we plan to hold our first Analyst Day since early 2019 at the W South Beach in Miami on Wednesday, September 27. We will open registration for that event in June. And we look forward to seeing you in South Florida and sharing a deeper dive on our business with you this fall. So now Lenny and I are happy to answer your questions. And then, Leeny, the only thing I might add for Joe's benefits since his question was specific to China, we did see in the quarter, Joe, that Mainland China RevPAR was fully recovered to 2019 levels. But remember, the vast majority of that recovery was domestic demand. At the end of the quarter, only about 20% of the international airlift in China has recovered. I think by April, it was recovered about 40%. And so we do expect a stronger and stronger return of international demand in China through the balance of the year. Sure. So as we think about not only the re-platforming of our major systems but also ongoing investment in our technology infrastructure, we always think about it through the lens of the impact on our associates, our guests and our owners and franchisees. I think from an associate perspective, particularly our future workforce is a workforce that has grown up opening an iPhone box with the understanding that there are no instructions and that, that technology will be intuitive and the design of our future technology will be similarly intuitive. So we think it will both be advantageous as we compete for talent, but it will also create capacity for them to more deeply engage with our guests. For our guests, we envision both at the property level and our customer engagement centers, making the breadth of information that we have about our guests available to our agents so that they can quickly and seamlessly address whatever questions or concerns or needs that those guests have. And then I think from the owner's perspective, there are both inherent operating efficiencies from new technologies that should be margin enhancing. And I also think from a revenue generation perspective, today, when you go to m.com you have the ability to book rooms. When our new systems roll out, the full breadth of products and services that we have to sell our customers, food beverage, spa, golf will be available at a single click. And we think that represents a very meaningful revenue upside. And I might just build on that, Stephen, the -- we talked a little bit about this last quarter. Of course, the teams around the world continue to pursue individual asset conversions, but we are just as aggressively looking for portfolio conversions. You might remember that in the middle of last year we were delighted to announce an 8-hotel portfolio conversion in Vietnam that we referred to as Vinpearl. Just last month, we did Vinpearl Round 2, which was seven additional hotels, about 2,500 rooms, three of which are conversions that will open in calendar 2023. So I think that multi-unit portfolio conversion strategy is something you should reasonably expect to continue to be a focus area for our teams. Yes, of course. So as I mentioned in the opening remarks, on the long list of attributes that excite us about this transaction, it is a great way for the company to enter the midscale segment, which is not a segment where we have competed previously. When we have talked in the past about the breadth of our portfolio, we've often responded to questions by saying we love the breadth of that portfolio for the way in which, it satisfies the wants and needs of both our guests and our owners and franchisees. And mid-scale is a tier where we hear demands from both of those constituents. Mid-scale obviously is - as from a RevPAR perspective and a rate positioning perspective, positioned below brands like Fairfield that are in our current architecture. We think there is an immediate opportunity to accelerate the growth of City Express across the Caribbean and Latin American region. As we have done with many brands that we've either developed organically or acquired. We are indeed been exploring the applicability of the City Express platform, and its growth potential in other markets around the world. And in fact here in the U. S., we're just a few weeks away from announcing a simple, modern, streamlined, new build, extended state product that has very basic services and amenities for those looking for longer stays at our mid-scale price point, and you should expect to hear more about that in the coming weeks. Of course. Sure. So obviously, we're very focused on rate and I think that's revealed in the results with global ADR up about 11% in the quarter. If you look at the U.S. and Canada, Q1 luxury rates as you point out were down slightly year-over-year. But as we dig into that data, our sense is that modest decline is largely around mix shift. So the prior several quarters, the bulk of that luxury rate growth was in leisure destinations, resort destinations as we start to see pickup in demand in urban downtown core destinations. That's great for the business, but it's at lower rates and that's dragging down a bit. With that said, globally luxury ADR was up 4% in the quarter even as compared to the extraordinarily strong ADR we saw for luxury in the first quarter. And then, I think your second question was on? And then just to put a little more context to your question, Robin. And I think this kind of tracks with the industry data that you referenced. This is system wide for the quarter, we then as compared to '22 luxury RevPAR was up 18% extended stay RevPAR was up 16% select brand RevPAR was up 23% and premium RevPAR was up 35%. Yes, thank you. You're welcome. Of course, so then the fundamental strategy has not shifted. You are right to point out that prior to Starwood, there was a fairly consistent cadence of what we always refer to as bolt-on acquisitions. But the bulk of those acquisitions had some common D&A. They often helped us gain a foothold in a geography where we were dissatisfied with the pace of organic growth. And they often - we often have the view that they represented a growth platform either regionally or potentially globally. AC acquisition would be perhaps the best illustration of that. Our industry leading scale gives us maybe the luxury of not needing to do M&A to gain scale. We enjoy scale. But we will continue to look at opportunities, if we believe there is a gap in the geography where our guests seek to travel and we're dissatisfied with our footprint or if we see a gap in our brand architecture. That was what guided the City Express transaction, a transaction that solidified the strength and leadership of our footprint in the CALA region and also filled in a gap our brand architecture by giving us entry into mid-scale. But the final bit of common D&A in every one of those transactions is the discipline around the valuation, and you should expect to see that same discipline as we evaluate. What I think will be a fair number of opportunities that will be floating around out, there in the market. And then maybe the last comment I would make is, as I reflect on the last decade or more of expansion of our platform. I'm delighted that we've expanded our brand architecture through a thoughtful blend of both M&A and organically generated platforms. When I look at the success, we've had with organic launches like Autograph and Moxy and I blend that with powerhouses like Residence Inn and Ritz-Carlton and AC which were added to the system through M&A., I really like that approach. Of course. Sure. So I'll give it a try, and Leeny feel free to jump in. As we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we continue to see robust demand recovery translating into strong occupancy growth. In fact, on a global basis, we saw 11 points of occupancy improvement in the quarter. When we think about our updated guidance, at the high end of that guidance, we expect our RevPAR growth to be fairly evenly split between ADR and occupancy gains. So, we do expect there to be continued occupancy gains at the high end of that guidance. The low end of the range would, reflect a meaningful softening in the global economy in the back half of the year. And that would have worldwide RevPAR relatively flat, compared to where we were in the back half of last year. Good morning. Yes. So the way I'd answer that, Patrick, we've already been showing it. The discussions we've been having with the various jurisdictions are, just about making sure that the transparency of those disclosures is enhanced and crystal clear for our guests. It is not as if those were hidden somehow, we're simply further clarifying and enhancing that transparency. I will leave it to the state AGs around the rest of the country for the rest of the industry. But I am pleased, that we will lead the industry in terms of the transparency of our disclosure for our guests. Of course. Good morning. Yes, I don't think there's necessarily a typical percentage. If I had to guess over the last decade or so, it's probably relatively evenly split, between an owner that simply has an opportunity to change brands or to flag an independent hotel versus an opportunity that is, created as a result of a transaction. But I think that ebbs and flows a bit depending on where we find ourselves in an economic cycle. Good morning. Yes. So I think the borders are just opening, the economy is just starting to really gear up. So it's a bit soon for new construction starts. What I can tell you is some of the in-flight construction projects that have been paused have restarted. Our approval volumes are accelerating, the volume of memorandums of understanding that we're negotiating and executing are accelerating. So all of the leading indicators that should drive construction starts are really encouraging, but probably a bit premature to have any really strong data for you. And maybe the last point I would add, because we're so heavily weighted to the most valuable quality tiers of our upscale and luxury, oftentimes when we engage with the owner, the project is well under construction. So unlike the U.S., where our conversations start with a greenfield site, they may come to us with a tower of 25 stories out of the ground. So it's a bit of an apples to orange comparison. And the only other small note I would make, and I'm sure you're aware of this, with Chinese government just pivoted a bit and said that those foreign visas issued prior to March 28 of '20, that initially, they have said would need to be renewed, those are now available for use for entry into Mainland China, which should pave the way for greater inbound international because of the queue for new visa processing for international visitors had been quite lengthy. Welcome. Yes. Not yet. I mean I think the best statistical data we have is the recovery by day of the week, and we continue to see strong recovery on Sundays and Thursdays, which is probably the most compelling empirical data we have that suggests that blended trip purpose continues to be strong. And then I would supplement that data with what we hear anecdotally when we're talking both with special corporate customers and with group customers who are talking to us as we re-platform our technology and encouraging us to make it easier for their business travelers or their group meeting attendees to book a single reservation that has both business and leisure purposes.

            "name": "Leeny Oberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results reflected robust demand growth around the world with all regions and all hotel tiers posting solid performance. U.S. and Canada RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year; occupancy reached 66%, up 8 percentage points, while ADR rose 10% versus the year ago quarter. International RevPAR rose a remarkable 63% over the '22 first quarter with ADR rising 16%. Occupancy reached 64%, an 18 percentage point improvement versus the prior year quarter. Demand was strong in all international markets with particularly impressive improvement in Asia Pacific after travel restrictions were lifted. RevPAR in Greater China was 95% recovered to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and Mainland China was more than fully recovered. This is all the more notable given that demand in the quarter was overwhelmingly driven by domestic travelers as international airlift was still less than 20% of 2019 capacity at the end of March. As you will recall, around one quarter of room nights in Greater China were from international guests pre-pandemic. International flights to and from China are slowly being adding, although airlift is only expected to be around 40% of 2019 levels in the second quarter. Total gross fee revenues totaled $1.1 billion, nearly 40% above the prior year quarter with a meaningful rise in incentive management fees, or IMF. IMF nearly doubled compared to 2022 to $201 million. They also topped the first quarter of 2019 by 23%, with every region except for Greater China, earning more incentive fees than in the 2019 first quarter. Our non-RevPAR-related franchise fees also grew meaningfully once again totaling $197 million, up 16% year-over-year, primarily due to co-branded credit card fees rising 18%. Containing cost remains a focus at both the corporate and the hotel level. In the U.S. and Canada, margins at our managed hotels rose two percentage points versus the 2022 first quarter, and they remain above 2019 margin levels. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.1 billion, a new quarterly record despite the first quarter being the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. Now let's talk about our 2023 outlook, the full details of which are in our earnings press release. With the better-than-expected first quarter results and robust global booking trends, we're raising our full year guidance. Macroeconomic uncertainty is not impacting our short-term demand and trends across all customer segments remain strong. The second quarter is expected to benefit from particularly strong year-over-year growth in international markets, especially in Asia Pacific. However, there is less visibility in forecasting the company's financial performance for the second half of the year. The high end of the range reflects relatively steady global economic conditions throughout the remainder of 2023 with continued resilience of travel demand across all customer segments and markets. The low end of the range reflects a meaningful softening of the global economy in the second half of the year with worldwide RevPAR in the last two quarters, roughly flat compared to 2022. For the full year, RevPAR in the U.S. and Canada could grow 6% to 9% and international RevPAR could grow 22% to 25%, leading to global RevPAR rising 10% to 13%. Total fees for the full year could rise between 13% and 16% with a non-RevPAR-related component increasing 4% to 7%. Non-RevPAR fee growth is expected to benefit from higher credit card fees resulting from growth in average spend and in the number of cardholders. We still expect G&A expenses of $915 million to $935 million, an annual increase of 3% to 5%, but still below 2019 levels. Full year adjusted EBITDA could increase between 13% and 18%, and adjusted EPS could rise 19% to 26% above 2022. Our powerful asset-light business model continues to generate a great deal of cash. In the first quarter, our net cash provided by operating activities was around $890 million, and we returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through the end of March. Our capital allocation philosophy has not changed. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value while returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest cash dividend and share repurchases. For the full year, we still expect 2023 investment spending of $850 million to $1 billion. This includes $100 million through the just completed acquisition of the City Express brand portfolio as well as higher-than-typical investment in our customer-facing technology, which is overwhelmingly expected to be reimbursed over time. With the increase in our adjusted EBITDA forecast, we now expect to return between $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion to shareholders in 2023. On the development front, we are sure many of you have questions about the banking environment in the U.S. and in Europe, in particular. Given rapidly rising interest rates, the financing environment in these regions has been challenging for some time. Another element of uncertainty has now been added as some banks wait for more clarity around capital requirements and perhaps additional regulations. However, while there are challenges with lending, especially for new construction projects, deals that have committed financing continue to move forward. Additionally, the number of deals leading the pipeline is not increasing. Fallout in the quarter was around 1.5% below our historical average of just over 2%. We're closely monitoring the situation and the regulatory response but we do expect the tightening in hotel financing to be short term. As we have seen over time, hotel financing has proven to be quite resilient over the long term. Hotel loans have been among the better-performing sectors of commercial real estate lending of late as hotels continue to post excellent operating results. I'll now turn the call back over to Tony, who has a few more comments before we go to Q&A. Thanks. Sure. So let me just kind of set the stage a little bit, and that is that you -- we talked about the fact that IMF's essentially doubled Q1 over Q1. And certainly, a huge part of that was driven by Asia Pacific in their great RevPAR recovery. So again, broadly speaking, if you call it, $100 million increase in IMF, about $30 million to $40 million of that came from Asia Pacific. So definitely with a disproportionate increase in RevPAR relative to the rest of the world, they were a big provider. As you know, Joe, generally, our incentive fees in Asia Pacific do not include an owner's priority. So they tend to be not quite as lumpy in terms of the way that they return. So we would expect, as you see incentive fees for the remainder of this year, to continue to show that characteristic. And I guess the best way to put it is that if we hit the high end of our guidance, you could expect to see incentive fees globally actually surpass the peak levels that we had in 2019. And then the only other thing that I'll point out is that, obviously, our managed rooms, which make up about 550,000 rooms out of 1.5 million, over 75% of them are full-service rooms. So as you see the strength in both group and returning business transient and continued leisure demand, I think that bodes well for IMF. No, I think we always get requests for financial support, and we're happy to consider them. I do think, Joe, at the end of the day, the largest area of the capital stack, particularly in the U.S. that needs to be filled, is the senior loan. And so from that perspective, that is not a place where we typically get requests. And so around the edges, I would say there's a bit more request for whether they're debt service guarantees or operating profit guarantees, and that obviously is for managed properties. But I would say that, broadly speaking, the level of capital that we're putting into deals has not changed meaningfully. That this really is more about a temporary slowdown in the bank's willingness to get some of these financings over the finish line. And Stephen, the only thing that I'll add is just a reminder that this is really a multiyear process that -- we talked about it a quarter ago, we talked about it again today, and that is that, I mean, we're thrilled with what we see for the potential with this and that, that will impact this year's investment spending, but we expect this will take several years. Well, I'll make a couple of comments. First of all, the continued strength in conversions is obviously great for our visibility into the pipeline. They tend to be shorter to actually open, they tend to be clearer and exactly what needs to be done to be able to put our flag on them. And you've seen that we continue to put out really strong numbers on both signings and openings. The other trend that we've noticed over the past couple of years is increasing comfort internationally with conversions. And as you think about our soft brands, that really started, frankly, in the U.S. with Autograph and then have now really expanded as you think about Autograph Luxury collection tribute and to some extent, Delta, you really see those spreading more around the world. And that obviously gives us better visibility both for the rooms that are going to open and frankly, really helps support the net rooms growth thesis that we have. Sure. I think you heard me talk about the 4% to 7% expectation for 2023, which is obviously a bit different as it relates to fees from RevPAR given what we're seeing in the lodging operations for the year. So I think overwhelmingly, as you know, the non-RevPAR fees are co-brand credit card fees. Those are the largest chunk. And they are going to tie to both the number of cardholders and the level of average spend. I think it won't surprise you that as you've seen people start to amount of COVID that we are seeing the average spend on credit card increases year-over-year moderate. But I will also say that the number of cardholders is growing very nicely. So I would say that it is relatively speaking, more growth coming from the increased base of cardholders than it is on the actual spend, but it is a great combination of the two of them. The other thing is on our resi fees, on our resi branding fees, they over a kind of three to five year time horizon, they've just been growing beautifully as there's great demand for that product of ours, but they are a bit lumpier in terms of when the actual residences open. And that, I think you should expect to see that it will continue to grow over time, but that it can vary quarter-to-quarter quite meaningfully given the onetime nature of those fees. So business transient room nights are down about 1% versus 2019. Obviously, the rate has been terrific, particularly with the most recent renegotiation at the special corporate rate. On economy which largely as you might imagine, I think we don't play very much there really in any meaningful way. I think it's not a surprise when you see that just generally speaking in economy, there tends to be less variability both up and down over time than you see in the highest end rates. But I think again, I will point out on luxury, Robin that we're still very, very pleased with what we see in terms of luxury demand. And frankly, when you think, for example, people having more opportunities of where they want to travel. It's one of the benefits of being the size and scale of our system, because they're actually may not be going to some places domestically, that they were going before, but can now actually go abroad. Sure. I think it's a great question to be able to reinforce where we are, which is that we have been for some time continue to be and expect for the rest of this year to continue to be at the low end of the investment grade leverage targets. So the biggest chunk of all, of the chunk relative to the increase in capital return is from the increase in expected EBITDA and cash flow for the company. So if you think about broadly speaking, the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA going up between $250 million and $300 million, it's pretty straight math to see that that can get you to this increase of call it roughly $700 million of midpoint of capital return. So, we feel really strong about the way the business is operating, from a cash flow performance as well as the visibility that we've got, certainly in the near-term. But even at the lower end of the guidance that we provided, I think, we still feel really good about being at the low end of our leverage targets with the kind of capital return range that, we've given. So the only thing, I'll add is it is interesting when you look at occupancy compared to 2019, and we do continue to make progress in that comparison. When I look at U.S. and Canada kind of moving through from January through March of this Q compared to '19, we're down to only two percentage points, difference by the time we're at March. And globally, actually, we're only two percentage points in March as well. I think there are a couple of things to note. Number one is the portfolios are pretty different. We've added 11% more rooms since 2019. So the comparison starts to be not completely apples-to-apples. And I think there's, also been some great learnings on the part of the industry about revenue management. And there, I think at the end of the day, we're trying to make sure that we're maximizing the returns on these real estate assets. And then as you've seen with group, for example, there's actually been some benefit over the reality that group is booking closer to the time of the actual event. So I think, we will eventually get back there. We are getting fairly close. But I think the best part is that you're seeing the fundamental business segments of business, transient leisure and group really all operating on full cylinders, not exactly the way they behaved in 2019, but still really in good shape. Yes. On the penetration side - is that your question on Marriott? Are you talking about digital channels or are you talking about Marriott? Yes. So for the first quarter, globally, the member penetration was 53% and in the U.S., it was 60%. No, that has stayed that's at about 11%, and that is quite similar to what was pre-COVID. I think the interesting part is that you look at either the digital channels which have grown 600 basis points since pre-COVID or if you look at all of Marriott's direct channels together. We've actually grown share about 100 basis points since pre-COVID, but the OTAs have remained roughly flat. Sure. So yes, you've got the basic parameters roughly right, which is those that have started construction, you would expect those to be already be financed. There's not a specific number on firm financing for that other 60%. That's an ongoing process and always has been between the developers as they consider their various capital sources. One thing to remember in that is, that our pipeline is over 50% international, which does tend to be less dependent on senior loan financing. And then for the remainder, in the U.S., it is overwhelmingly limited service of franchised properties. And those from a relative speaking basis, we do believe that there is some slowdown in the pace of financing for those, but we are, at the same time, continuing to see that banks are willing to consider loans for strong brands and strong proven markets. And we are still seeing that lenders are looking at those projects. So, I don't think that there is a fundamental change in how we see those projects materializing and to actually build hotels. I'd also remind you that there's, quite a few conversion hotels in that as well. So I think, as you've probably seen in past times where lending has had a slowdown that there can be a bit of a slowdown and the construction starts. But that we do expect with the performance of the hotel business and frankly, the relative performance of hotel loans, particularly in limited service loans, we would expect that to get going again more quickly. We aren't seeing fall out of those deals from our pipeline in anything more than a typical fashion. Well, we're certainly going to have as many as we can, you can be sure of that. I think I'd make two comments. First of all, certainly with the use of revolving credit in the U.S., that is by far, the lion's share of, the fees that we received are related to the U.S. But I would say the rate of growth that we're seeing in terms of both the, spend and the cardholder numbers in international is really quite tremendous. Both in terms of the numbers of cards - numbers of countries, that we're adding cards as well as the number of cardholders in those countries. So, we've been really pleased with the increases for example, in Japan, in South Korea, in terms of the growth in cardholders. And I think that bodes really well for future growth, but also for our hotel growth and for our hotel business, because these are all Bonvoy members who want to be earning points and staying at our properties. So it's a great part of the ecosystem of our business. Well, I think the best way - we don't have a particular percentage. As you know, we don't control exactly when they open. We do keep a very careful eye on how they are doing, and again, feel comfortable with the numbers that we've talked - that Tony talked about in terms of the gross room openings, which has both a share of those coming out from under construction as well as conversions. And I'll just add one other point that may be as you try to come up with your own math, is just a reminder that for hotel construction and a limited service hotel is roughly speaking, two years under construction and a full-service hotel can be anywhere from three to four. The other thing I'll point out is that roughly speaking, about 15% of our Chinese pipeline deals have some state-owned enterprise participation. And I think that does help as you think about the capital sourcing for those projects that is helpful as we get those ongoing again. Yes, sure. Absolutely. So I do -- if you look at year-over-year Q1, you are right in pointing out that the U.S. IMF, which came close to doubling in Q1 from 42 to 85, actually did double, that growth was overwhelmingly driven by the premium hotels was the return of group and business transient to our premium hotels. We did continue to see growth in IMF from our luxury hotels, but the biggest chunk of growth came from those premium hotels. So I think with the strength of group that Tony pointed out, in his comments for the rest of the year that you should continue to see the strong growth in both U.S. and Canada IMFs as well as international. Sure. So I'll start with the second question first, and then Tony will fill in also. And that is, yes, on the second question. While we actually have seen the dollar soften a little bit more than where we were relative to when we gave guidance earlier in February, the reality is that we are still seeing great demand for Europe hotels for the summer and very pleased with the booking patterns we see there. On Greater China, let me talk about a couple of things. First of all, cross-border, just a reminder of our comments earlier that roughly three quarters of the business typically is domestic. Well, right now, it's over 90% is domestic. So I think there is the reality that there's going to be more travel both in and out of Greater China as demand -- as the airlift improve. So we would expect to see that help both other parts of the world, but also that there's more travel into China. In terms of the segment, it's seeing the recovery in segments very similar to the way that we saw it in other parts of the world. The one difference being that on special corporate and business transient in China that is recovering much more quickly than it did in the U.S. For example, overwhelmingly, people are back in their offices in Greater China, while in the U.S., there's obviously much more of a hybrid mix. So we are actually seeing all of the segments recover more in line with each other rather than necessarily one after another the way it was in the U.S. Yes. I would probably consider it about the timing of the recovery. So a couple of broad comments. Generally speaking, lodging demand does have a high correlation with GDP growth. So when you think of emerging economies like India, as an example, where you're seeing 6% GDP growth, that's going to be very different than what you see in the U.S. where more typical GDP growth might be more like 2%, and so the impact of a recession can be different in that regard. But I think when I think about the guidance that we've given this year, it is much more tied to the pace of recovery. The U.S., for example, meaningfully farther along in its recovery from COVID than Asia Pacific, for example. And I think we're clearly seeing that now all restrictions are lifted in Asia Pacific and that both pent-up demand and return of demand is coming quite nicely, which will mean that should we see an economic slowdown, I think they will be impacted a bit less than, for example, in the U.S., where obviously in the U.S., if we see it, it's starting from a different point. So again, as we talked about, we would imagine that Q3 and Q4 and that slowdown does mean that there is a meaningful economic slowdown. I'm not sure I would call it a super sharp deep V. But clearly, a real meaningful economic slowdown that would get us to that roughly flat RevPAR in Q3 and Q4 compared to '22."

Following the prepared remarks, the floor will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jackie McConagha, Senior [Technical Difficulty]\nJackie McConagha: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Marriott's third quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Development ; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by our comments. Unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR, occupancy, average daily rate and property level revenues reflect system wide constant currency results for comparable hotels and all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Statements in our comments in the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. And now I will turn the call over to Tony.\nAnthony Capuano: Thank you, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect continued momentum in our business. Net rooms grew nearly 6% year-over-year and development activity remained strong. Global RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of solid rate growth with ADR up 2.5%. Globally, group was once again the top performing customer segment. Group RevPAR rose 10% year-over-year for the second quarter in a row with robust increases in both room nights and ADR. At the end of September, global group revenues were pacing roughly flat for the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative impact from the election in the U.S. and up 8% for the full year 2024. Given our industry-leading distribution of convention hotels at nearly double the number of rooms of the next closest peer, we are pleased that group strength is continuing into next year. Group revenues for 2025 were pacing up 7% at the end of the quarter, on a 3% increase in room nights and a 4% increase in average daily rate. Globally, business transient experienced another quarter of growth with third quarter RevPAR rising 2%. Leisure transient RevPAR was flat to the year ago quarter, while still well above 2019 levels. If we look at trends by region, RevPAR rose over 2% in the U.S. and Canada, driven by growth in average rate. RevPAR growth at luxury and full service hotels outperformed select service properties and weekdays surpassed weekends, reflecting strength in group and business transient compared to leisure. RevPAR grew 5% internationally, driven by 9% RevPAR increases in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in Asia Pacific, excluding China. EMEA growth was helped by the Paris Olympics and other special events, as well as solid demand from U.S. travelers. APAC strength was broad-based across the region and benefited from international guests, especially from Greater China. Cross-border travel on a global basis is now above pre-pandemic levels at just over 20% of total rooms. Greater China RevPAR declined to 8% in the third quarter as macroeconomic pressures led to weak domestic leisure demand and restricted pricing power. Severe weather and higher end guests traveling to other regions also impacted the area. Despite the demand headwinds, our hotels continue to outperform our peers, gaining RevPAR index across Greater China in the quarter. We also grew RevPAR index on a global basis. Marriott Bonvoy, our industry-leading global travel and loyalty program had a record quarter of enrollments with our membership base growing to over 219 million members at the end of September. With co-branded credit cards in 11 countries in CALA as well as numerous collaborations and thousands of Marriott Bonvoy Moments experiences, including the Taylor Swift Eras Tour sweepstakes, we are focused on enhancing engagement with our members, both on and off property. Thanks to our recent tie-up with Starbucks, even members with only one hotel stay can now redeem points for a cup of coffee. We're thrilled with our development activity. In the third quarter, we added around 16,000 net rooms, reaching more than 1.67 million rooms at nearly 9,100 properties around the world. Global signing activity has remained strong with more than 95,000 organic rooms signed year-to-date in 2024. Compared to a quarter ago, our pipeline grew 5% to a record 585,000 rooms. Our momentum in conversions, including multiunit opportunities continues to reflect owner preference for our brands worldwide. In August, we announced a multiunit conversion deal with Sonder for 9,000 existing rooms and a few thousand more in the pipeline. This deal expands our portfolio of longer stay accommodations in key global markets, including New York and Dubai. In the third quarter, conversions represented over 30% of room additions and over 50% of signs. In October, we announced City Express by Marriott as the brand name of our new transient mid-scale product here in the U.S. and in Canada. With its highly effective operating model, an outstanding value proposition, we have already received extensive interest from owners. We expect to have signed agreements and even a few openings over the next few months. Our progress in the mid-scale space around the world has been outstanding, and we look forward to meaningfully enhancing our presence in this high growth segment of the market. Our strong 2024 net rooms growth and signings performance is exciting, and I'm proud of our associates for their work in driving preference for our brands among both guests and owners. Marriott Bonvoy has never been stronger, and we look forward to further expanding our presence around the world. Our business momentum is excellent and as a company that embraces change, we continue to evolve our business to support our global growth. To this end, we have undertaken an enterprise-wide process to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the company. We want to further empower our teams closest to our markets guests, owners and franchisees to operate even more nimbly. While this work is not yet complete, we believe these efforts will drive increased profitability and enhanced value. I will now turn the call over to Leeny, who will share more details and then walk through our financial results and updated guidance. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. At this point in the process, we expect these efforts to yield $80 million to $90 million of annual pre-tax general and administrative cost reductions beginning in 2025. In addition, we expect to deliver cost savings to our owners and franchisees. This initiative is anticipated to result in roughly $100 million of charges, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024. The charges will be recorded in restructuring and merger related charges and in reimbursed expenses. With meaningful growth opportunities around the world across are more than 30 brands, we're confident these efforts will make us even more competitive. Now turning to our third quarter results. Gross fee revenues rose 7% in the quarter to $1.28 billion. The increase reflects higher global RevPAR, rooms growth and increase in residential branding fees helped by timing and higher co-brand credit card fees. IMF grew 11% to $159 million. Growth in IMF was led by higher fees in the U.S. and Canada as well as strong growth in APAC and CALA, partially offset by a $5 million decline in Greater China. G&A in the quarter rose 15%, primarily due to a $19 million operating profit guarantee reserve for a U.S. hotel, which was negotiated in connection with the company's acquisition of Starwood as well as an $11 million litigation reserve. Even with these $31 million of reserves, third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew faster than gross fees, rising 8% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.26. Now let's talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter, and we still assume 3% to 4% growth for the full year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is anticipated to be higher in most international markets than in the U.S. and Canada. Fourth quarter RevPAR growth in the U.S. and Canada is currently expected to be generally in line with the third quarter, with strong leisure and BP trends in October, offsetting weakness in November due to tomorrow's election. The election impact on U.S. and Canada RevPAR is forecasted to be around negative 300 basis points in November and negative 100 basis points for the quarter, double that of past election cycles as we have meaningfully lower transient and group room nights on the books for both this week and next. Greater China is still expected to post negative RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region. In the fourth quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 4% to 5% range. Compared to our July guidance, fees are expected to be impacted by softer performance at certain hotels under renovation and lower than previously forecasted residential branding fees due to timing. Our owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, could total roughly $95 million. For the full year, gross fees are anticipated to grow 6% to 7% to $5.13 billion to $5.15 billion. Unleased and other revenues net of expenses could total around $346 million. We now expect full year G&A expense can rise 4% to 5% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to total $4.93 billion to $4.96 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over 2023. 2024 adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be between $9.19 and $9.27 with a 25% assumed tax rate. We're now forecasting full year investment spending of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, this year's spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multiyear transformation of our property management, reservations and loyalty systems the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. The rollout of these platforms is slated to begin later next year, and we look forward to the many benefits that should accrue from elevating from three major tech platforms. Our powerful asset light business model generates a great deal of cash and our philosophy on allocating that capital remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade ratings and investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through share repurchases and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We now expect to return approximately $4.4 billion to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago expected to occur later this month. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust development activity across our global portfolio. This summer, we raised our full year 2024 net room guidance to 6% to 6.5% growth after signing the Sonder deal. With increased visibility, we now anticipate 2024 routes growth at the top end of this range or around 6.5%. We still expect net rooms to grow at a solid three year CAGR of 5% to 5.5% from year end 2022 to year end 2025. Thank you for your continued interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, good morning. Thank you. I guess a couple of related questions around the efficiencies. At a high level, what was the impetus for taking these actions now and where do you see the biggest areas of opportunity to streamline, and then also just how to think about the run rate of SG&A growth perhaps before factoring in these benefits?\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Stephen. Maybe I'll take the first part of your question, and then turn it over to Leeny. I think the impetus is -- maybe I'll start at 100,000 feet. One of the company's core values is this notion of always embracing change. And we think right now, we operate from a position of strength. The business has really strong momentum, as Leeny just described. Then the company is quite different than the last time we looked holistically at the organization. You think about the changes in the company over the last decade. We've more than doubled in size over the last decade. We've entered over 60 new countries now operating in 142 countries. And so it felt like the right time to really look across the enterprise and figure out what adjustments we can make to enhance and improve our efficiency. In terms of run rate, Leeny, you want to take that?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. So thanks, Stephen. I think, first of all, let me talk a little bit about the 80 to 90, and that is really thinking about savings off of our current cost base. So when we think about moving forward, we've talked to you over time about a kind of typical longer-term run rate of inflation plus perhaps a point or so to support above average growth. And from that perspective, I think it's too early for us to give any specifics about next year. We're really just beginning our full loan budget process, but really think about that 80 to 90 as being off of our current run rate.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. And maybe as an unrelated follow-up, the pipeline improved sequentially, and it looks like it's in a good position for next year. I know you don't want to talk about 2025 too much, but is there any major puts and takes to think about rooms growth into next year and the fees per room contribution from that pipeline?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. So in terms of -- we're in the early stages of the 2025 budget process. I think that the visibility that we have so far underpins Leeny's comment about our confidence in the three year CAGR that we laid out during the Security Analyst Meeting. On the fees per room question, that's obviously something we're digging into. And if you look at fees per room for RevPAR related fees, pulling out the non-RevPAR as they tend to grow faster. Both in '24 and in '25, we see average fees per room growing, which might seem a little counterintuitive given our push into midscale, but I think there are two principal drivers there. Number one, we continue to see really strong momentum in the luxury tier, which drives outsized fees. And as Leeny talked about, we continue to see strong growth in incentive management fees.\nStephen Grambling: Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning, everyone.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Good morning. Leeny, maybe I just want to start with kind of the fee algorithm here, if we just kind of do the couple of building blocks for everyone. Obviously, RevPAR up 3% to 4% net unit growth coming in on the high side of expectation over 6%. As we look at the kind of gross fee piece, obviously, it's a bit beneath A plus B. So just could you walk us through or remind us of what's the gap this year? Is that a little bit of dilution from MGM just given those rooms and the fee contribution there? Does that have to do with IMF, just what are a couple of the pieces there and how do you expect it to more importantly trend kind of longer term? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Yeah. We've had this conversation a number of times, which is, I think when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, it's very hard to see the overall fee because there are just a typical loneliness that comes with IMF, for example, you heard about the lower year-over-year IMF and IMF rich territory like Greater China, you've obviously got things like renovation impact, which are very important overall to the health of portfolio, and we're really excited about what those renovations will produce. But when you put that all together, combined it with a little bit of FX, etc., quarter-over-quarter, it is absolutely going to be lumpy. We do believe that this algorithm works over time. But then you do have a bit of the ramp-up issue as well as variations in RevPAR that can make it tougher just in one quarter. But again, as we look forward, really pleased with what we see in terms of the rooms that are coming on to the system. As we've talked about before, room signings are very strong this year. When you look at kind of year-over-year where we are and the strength of the conversions coming in the system, we do see that, that equation going forward looks pretty good.\nShaun Kelley: Great. And maybe just as my quick follow-up, and this is really just a clarification on the earlier question about G&A, just so we have the right base for next year, Leeny, the SG&A this year, obviously includes what the G&A this year, obviously includes the $30 million of kind of one-time reserve and guarantees. Should we back that out and then remove the incremental from that base or is this all working off the kind of stated number, the $10.50 to $10.60 starting point this year?\nLeeny Oberg: Right. So I think, generally, your philosophy is right, Shaun. I want to caveat that, though, we are way too early to be giving specifics about how you should come up with that number. We modestly got to look at all the elements of the different pieces that go into G&A. As you'll probably remember, we've also got normal increases in bad debt that come with the growth of the overall portfolio, etc., etc. So it's not quite as simple as you're describing. But philosophically, you are right that, that $31 million was not anticipated and not expected in normal run rate G&A. But right now, that 80 to 90 comes right out of this year's run rate.\nShaun Kelley: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Tony, I have some questions for you on China. It's been about a month since the economic stimulus went into play there. Have you seen any uplift or changes from that yet? And then my related question, do you have any initial thoughts about RevPAR growth or decline for China for next year? Certainly, China is a real wild card. I mean, it could be negative 10%. It could be positive 10% this year. I'm curious, if you have given your three days of visibility there. Any initial thoughts on expectations for China next year? Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: Sure. So let me try and remind me, if I've missed your few questions embedded in there. On the first one, stimulus. We're watching so closely, most the stimulus so far, really has not been to the direct benefit of the consumer. So we're not seeing any sort of immediate and material impact on performance metrics. The thing that is more interesting to me, not a great deal of stimulus or support for the property sector, which is obviously under quite a bit of duress, but despite that lack of stimulus to support the property sector, we talked about this last quarter as well. We continue to see really strong both signings and openings volume across Greater China. I think some of that is because we're seeing a real acceleration in our select service brands, which are marginally easier to get done from a capital staff perspective. But the short answer to your question is really not much yet in terms of the impact of stimulus. You're absolutely right when we think about visibility expectations about performance in China are really all over the board. And as Leeny mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're early in the process. What I would say to you is right now, as we start to peak into 2025. Absent any more significant stimulus it could be as good as flat going into '25. But again, that's a very early peak into the performance.\nLeeny Oberg: The only thing that I would add to that is that we get into the weeds of looking at Q3 and Q4 is that the margin, Greater China RevPAR has been slightly better than we expected a quarter ago as we move through Q3 and as we looked into October, and one of the things that is interesting is, we are starting to see a slight pickup in cross-border travel into the Tier 1 cities, kind of classic BT. Now again, it\u2019s only quite marginal because as you saw, RevPAR was down meaningfully in Q3, and we do expect that to continue. But at the margin, slightly better than we thought.\nPatrick Scholes: All right. Thank you for the color. I\u2019m all set.\nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRichard Clarke: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to start on the IMF, up 11% without sort of meaningful inflection on RevPAR. So just to make sure color there, and particularly on the U.S., how we can square a good IMF quarter with having to put in an operating reserve. Is that just on one hotel? And maybe any color on why you're needing to do that on that one hotel?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. The operating profit guarantee has nothing to do with IMF. When you look at IMF in Q3, it was the U.S. and Canada that was the outperformer, kind of a couple of different reasons. There was one element that was related to some insurance payments made from prior hurricanes, but also very good strong performance on the part of our large city managed hotels, which helped a bit. And then obviously, you see in APAC as well. We have good growth in our Asia Pacific outside of China IMF. Just to give you kind of a little bit of a sense overall, 22% of our hotels in the U.S. and Canada that are managed, paid an incentive fee in Q3, that's the same percentage as a quarter ago. So think of that as fairly consistent. And then outside the U.S., also still quite strong. I think Greater China was the one change where a little bit lower as a result of their continued weakness in RevPAR. As we look at Q4, that's where I think you see, when you look at the fee guidance that we gave, you actually see a little bit of this reverse from a standpoint that several of the hotels undergoing renovation will mean that we expect IMF to be a little bit weaker than a quarter ago as a result of that even though RevPAR is largely the same in U.S. and Canada.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up. When you talked about cost savings to franchisees and owners, are you talking about them delivering them some operating cost savings or are you talking about dropping any of your fees do you charge to your franchisees and owners?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. So we're looking at efficiencies and savings that we think will have clear benefits to the owners. We're looking at every facet of our engagement with them, and we expect to have some tangible saving opportunities identified for them in the very near future.\nRichard Clarke: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about kind of key money trends in terms of your new unit growth? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. Sure, Robin. Good morning. Yes. I would say more of the same. We've talked about this for several quarters from a standpoint that perhaps over a number of years. We've seen a bit more key money across more tiers. But I think more importantly, when you look about the percentage of fuels using key money that still is about the same at about a third of deals and when we think about the amount of key money per deal, also quite similar. So we are seeing trends that would mean you need to think about kind of meaningful increases in that element of our investment profile.\nAnthony Capuano: Maybe the only thing I would add, Rob, and we talked about this last quarter, as Leeny points out, the overall percentage of deals where we're using key money hasn't changed really at all. We are seeing selectively key money being used in a broader section of quality tiers than maybe we have in the past.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then if I could fit in a follow-up. I guess maybe sort of just two housekeeping things. One is, you mentioned that IMF included some hurricane payments that were kind of due to hurricanes in prior periods. I don't know if you could just quantify that so we can think about next year comping that, what would be not recurring? And then I don't know if there are any other that Starwood guarantee, you mentioned it seems like it was pretty long dated if it goes back to prior to the acquisition. Is there anything else like that, that sort of outstanding still left from other Starwood guarantees like that, that we might see in future periods? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. No, the business interruption immaterial, they\u2019re way too small to mention, it's in the laundry list of things that provide an outperformance in the U.S. and Canada. So really nothing that you would need to adjust out. We -- again, as you always know, quarter-to-quarter, you can have kind of variations on exactly what you're expecting to earn from a hotels. So really no numbers that would be meaningful at all. Yes, you're absolutely right. This was an unusual operating profit guarantee that was part of the settlement that we did in the acquisition of Starwood with an owner and meaningfully longer than a typical operating profit guarantee is for us. It was actually a total of a $70 million operating profit guarantee. This now takes us up to the MAX exposure that we have on that guarantee. And really, to your point, reflected the fact that we had a number of years and COVID to work through to have a view as to whether we would need to actually fund under that guarantee. So once we came out of COVID and could look forward over a number of years, we made the determination that we needed to take that reserve, but that is it. And to your point, no, we do not have a remaining operating profit guarantees with that kind of length and size of exposure.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everyone.\nAnthony Capuano: Good morning.\nJoe Greff: My first question goes back to your initiatives to improve efficiencies and take out some G&A costs. I know the $80 million to $90 million begins to yield the beginning of 2025. And I know it's early in the process. What would be a good outcome in terms of what you would expect to achieve next year? And then as you head into 2026, would you still be expecting to be run rating $80 million to $90 million or would you, at that point, expect to achieve all of it.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. The $80 million to $90 million, just to be clear, we do believe that is in '25. So that, that is beginning in '25 off of this year's cost base. Now we obviously have all the normal other parts that you have to look in your budget for G&A, and that's the part that we're in the process of Joe. So I think at this point, we're really pointing to a sustainable $80 million to $90 million in annual G&A cost savings.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you for clarifying that. And again, maybe it falls under the bucket of it's still kind of early here. But when you think about 2025 all in investment spending. Do you look at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion as a reasonable expectation or does it come down because there seems to be some -- at least some one-time items this year that you wouldn't expect to recur next year?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. No, and last, of course, as always, something comes up that, that we're not currently planning for, I totally agree with you that you would expect both $200 million that is included in that number related to the purchase of Chicago. Grand Sheridan as well as a $50 million land purchase that we made in Q3 for the Westin Peachtree, which really was to help us remove the lack of clarity around a ground lease that made it difficult for any owner to know with the long-term kind of cash stream from that asset could be. So that -- with that cleared up, that's terrific and that really is $250 million that, to your point, is not expected to be ongoing.\nJoe Greff: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Apologies, if this was covered and I missed it. But Tony, could you talk about the special corporate negotiated rate talks that are going on and how that's sort of coming together for next year?\nAnthony Capuano: Of course, yeah, we haven't talked about that yet. And again, we're relatively early in the process. But our takeaway from that early set of discussions, we are targeting a mid-single digit increase for 2025. And I think the teams are feeling pretty good about that target.\nBrandt Montour: Okay. That\u2019s great.\nLeeny Oberg: Just to add to that is that was definitely something we noticed was helpful this quarter with the continued strengthening of [indiscernible] that, that ADR continues to be useful.\nBrandt Montour: Yeah. Okay. Thanks for that. And then a follow-up, more of a bigger picture question for anyone. But I know developers are long-term planners and thinkers, but this said and the sort of uncertainty around interest rate movements here. Just curious, if it's weighing at all on developers' mindset in terms of how they're forming their capital planning for next year?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah, Brandt. And the bulk would be, of course. I mean they look at every variable in the equation that impacts their returns. I think they are encouraged that the Fed did a 50 bp drop. They are obviously on pins and needles waiting to see what action the Fed takes through the balance of this year. But I would say to you, availability of debt and an elevated construction cost environment are bigger impediments to driving the sort of construction start volume, and we saw pre-pandemic than the current level of interest rates.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks for that.\nA \u2013 Anthony Capuano: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi. good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nA \u2013 Anthony Capuano: Good morning.\nDavid Katz: Good morning. So I wanted to ask about leisure, broadly speaking. And just taking in all the information so far through earnings season, can you talk about sort of areas of strength versus weakness and what the range of levels is that you're seeing, right? And just how broadly that is or is it -- should we call it flattish just straight across the board which seems unlike it?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. So as you heard us say earlier that Q3 leisure transact was roughly flat to last year, although, well for 2019 levels. I think from a chain scale perspective, basically flat or slightly growing with luxury and premium, while really select service is where you saw a slight decline.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And my second question or my follow-up is really around net unit growth much longer term. I think it's fair to say the past few years or post-COVID, anyway, we've seen kind of a broader range of the kinds of base, Sonder being case in point or Bonvoy with MGM that have been added to the NUG process. Tony, how do you see NUG evolving if we look out two, three years? Does that kind of broadening of what NUG is defined as does that continue to grow over time?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. So as we said a quarter ago, you should reasonably expect the vast majority of our new units to be the sort of traditional management agreements and franchise agreements that you've seen when you hear Leeny talk about our three year CAGR 5% to 5.5% growth in NUG. That is really predicated on that traditional model of management agreements and franchise agrees. What I will say is, and maybe I'll pull MGM and Sonder apart because they're a bit unique. Everybody seems to lump those together, Sonder is really structured like a very traditional franchise agreement. MGM is different in that we brought together two powerhouse families of brands and to pull those two brands together, necessitated some real creativity in terms of structuring from both sides. But I will say, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the really extraordinary momentum that Bonvoy has and so certainly, we\u2019ll continue to get inquiries from prospective partners that want to take advantage of that momentum and we\u2019ll apply the same rigor and the same lens that we always have in evaluating those opportunities.\nDavid Katz: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDan Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just double back on the leisure commentary. I mean, obviously, it's been pretty choppy right now and certainly for the fourth quarter. But as you think about 2025 and comparing to this kind of environment we've been in. Is there any expectation or line of sight to may be growing next year as things may be cool down a bit?\nLeeny Oberg: No. I'll say a couple of things. I think the reality is, we're in the middle of our budget process, which I'm happy to say is very granular and gets down to the property level and exactly what's going on in every environment. I think the broadest comment I would make is we see 2025 barring some major economic change to be more of the same. So if you think about kind of our back half of our RevPAR this year and how we're looking at 2025, I think you probably see some quite similar trends. where when you think BT continues on, group still very strong. We've talked about these upper-single digits group pace for next year. And that would then mean that leisure we'd be up slightly, but also probably not taking a big jump up. And again, we will be getting much more into that in February when we've gone through the budget. But I would say, '25 looks a whole lot like the back half of '24 from where we sit today.\nDan Politzer: Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, it's more of a housekeeping. The non-RevPAR fees, you mentioned something along the lines of timing in the quarter. Is there -- I don't know if I missed it, but maybe if you can give us that actual non-RevPAR fees for the third quarter. And are we still on pace for that 9% to 10% growth in that line item for this year?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. So we are -- the three biggest items there are obviously the credit cards, residential and timeshare. And I think the one that really jumps out is what was going on with the residential branding fees, which, as you know, can be quite lumpy because if a whole development sells out. So as an example, in Q3 '24, that was $18 million, while a year ago in Q3, it was $7 million. So it more than doubled in one quarter. Credit card fees was the more stereotypical growth and timeshare tends to be fairly flattish given the structure of that contract. So you put it all together, but yes, for the full year, we continue to see the top end of single digits, 9% to 10% is the right growth range.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to one more on cost savings and then zoom out on net unit growth. But I mean, any impact to franchise sales or maybe even a reallocation to this team to support a faster organic net unit growth outlook? And then more broadly, zooming out on net unit growth, maybe just an update just on the competitive landscape of where you're winning or not winning deals today? Thanks.\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. So I think what I would say, Michael, the growing our market share is obviously a top priority for us, and it will continue to be. The growth potential we see across our family of brands, including the more recent entrants in mid-scale is really strong, and we think we have a really competitive offering to the franchise community. We continue to be optimistic about those growth prospects as you heard Leeny described, and we certainly think this initiative will add incremental support to that growth. And then I'm sorry, the second question, Michael?\nMichael Bellisario: Just an update on the broader landscape for conversions and signings where you're winning or not winning deals today?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. I mean, I think in Leeny's prepared remarks, she talked a little bit about that. The momentum that we continue to see in conversions is really encouraging, both single asset and multi-unit. And maybe I think I said this a quarter or two ago, but I'll reiterate it. I think it's a combination of factors. I think we have, as strong portfolio of conversion friendly brands as we\u2019ve had in my 30 years with the company. I think the teams are much more focused on removing friction from the conversion process. And we've got Leeny has dedicated resources in each of the continents that are singularly focused on driving conversion volume. And so we expect that conversion activity to continue at pace.\nMichael Bellisario: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks and good morning. You answered parts of this in previous questions, but I just wanted to hit you with a high level macro question. If you look at demand growth in the U.S. this year, room night growth compared to headline GDP growth. Has there been anything surprising about the way that has played out. And as you think about 2025, which segments do you think could be better in sync with headline GDP growth, whatever that ends up being?\nLeeny Oberg: So I\u2019ll start and then I'll have Tony jump in. I do think part of what we saw in '24 is the continued normalization in the U.S. and Canada. So for example, in leisure, you've definitely got in Q3. Year-to-date, actually, the leisure guidance are flat to a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Overall RevPAR is also year-to-date roughly flat in the U.S. in leisure. And that, I really ascribed to quite a bit of normalization. As you think about people kind of coming out of COVID and frankly, wanting to go anywhere, anytime, kind of no matter what to make sure that they were able to get their trial done. And I think that is normalizing a bit. While what you also saw was a business transient group kind of filling in to make up for where that slowdown was happening. So you actually look overall, and overall, in Q3, you saw room nights for year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada, up 1% and ADR up 2%. So in that regard, I think you continue to see a healthy series of demand. We believe that going forward, you're going to continue to see travel be a priority for our customers, whether it is group, BT or leisure. And of course, it has a relationship to the macroeconomic environment that's been proven in our industry cycle-in and cycle-out. But we would expect to continue to see with a strong economy, strong demand for our business.\nAnthony Capuano: And Duane, part of your question was around anything that's been a surprise. I don't know that I would characterize it as a surprise. But the continued strength quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year of group is a really encouraging sign. I mean we spent \u2013 all of us spend a lot of time with both corporate and association meeting planners and the appetite they have for group meeting just continues to be at the high end of our expectations, and it\u2019s really encouraging. And as I mentioned in my open particularly given the composition of our portfolio and our significant lead in our group hotel portfolio, that\u2019s a really terrific trend for our business.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. You mentioned 2025, maybe the sort of looking RevPAR wise kind of similar to the back half of '24, I think, which is kind of generally what we're hearing kind of from other companies and industry prognosticators. And I'm just wondering in that kind of scenario, is there just anything we should keep in mind relative to capital return expectations we should just think about? I know you had some property purchases this year you mentioned, which I guess won't repeat next year, but anything we should just bear in mind when you think about forecasting that?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. No, I think our -- as I was saying in my comments, our philosophy is exactly the same, which is, we are a growth company. We are all about investing in valuable growth for the enterprise and continuing to take market share around the world. We are blessed with a business model that produces more cash than we need to provide that growth. And so from that perspective, we would expect to continue to stay very solidly in the investment-grade leverage range and return excess capital to our shareholders.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, again, you mentioned sort of the ground lease purchases. I mean, and I think there's sort of a view that next year we could see sort of some pickup in hotel transaction activity. Would you hope to bring some of your owned assets to market next year? I mean, is that coming back and just sort of maybe more focus now? I know it's a smaller portfolio, but just kind of wondering your updated thoughts there?\nLeeny Oberg: So certainly, all the time, the reality is, we're looking at that all the time and evaluating what makes the most sense. As you've heard us talk about the W Union Square as well as the elegant portfolio in Barbados. We are nearing the end of the renovation of those properties and obviously, would look to take advantage of what we expect to be very strong performance on the part of those -- that portfolio in that hotel. And so as we move forward, depending on the financing environment and the appetite between as always, buyers and sellers, we will take advantage of that. So we're always searching for that.\nSmedes Rose: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nLizzie Dove: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit of a pulse check on the consumer. I know Tony you mentioned last quarter and then it skipped intra-quarter, just a little bit of pullback on ancillary spend, food and beverage space, things like that. I'm curious how that has evolved and ever since that period of time and what your kind of expectation is going forward?\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. Thank you, Lizzie. Of course, we spend an enormous amount of time in looking at the consumer from every possible angle. But I'll go to the ancillary spend since that was a topic we talked about a quarter ago. When you look globally, you almost have to bifurcate it and look at food beverage for meetings and events versus food and beverage and outlets and lounges. Food beverage for meetings and events continues to be quite strong. We are seeing a little bit of pullback on outlets and lounges, still growing and growing materially, but maybe not quite as strong as we saw. The one thing I would tell you, though, is we're not seeing that weakness in spending from customers of luxury hotels. When you look at outlets and lounge revenue for the third quarter at our luxury hotels. Now this excludes Greater China for some of the reasons we discussed earlier. But if you look at our global luxury portfolio ex-China, we actually saw spending in outlets and balances in the luxury portfolio, up 2%, which was the same increase we saw a quarter ago. So we'll continue to watch it, but that's pretty encouraging for us.\nLizzie Dove: Got it. That's helpful. And then going back to the fee side of things, you mentioned the renovation headwind and the timing of the residential branding fees. As you move into 2025, is that expected to kind of normalize? Will those renovations be kind of broadly complete? Just curious how we should think about the kind of cadence there?\nLeeny Oberg: Well, you have to know. Yes, on the ones that are finishing up, but we've always got hotels going under renovation. But -- and we obviously will be carefully looking at that as we go through the budgeting process and looking at our fee guidance for next year. I don't expect Lizzie that it would impact things meaningfully.\nLizzie Dove: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Tony, you mentioned that the convention business or the pacing for '25 looks pretty good in terms of room nights and ADR. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more. Are you seeing the same companies just kind of renew or add another convention or are you actually seeing growth in some of the businesses or industries that hadn't come back fully from a group standpoint? Thanks.\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chad. I would say both. We are seeing companies who have been traveling and meeting, building out their calendar of meetings. And we are seeing some of our partners who perhaps were on pause starting to schedule. And I think some of that is driven by -- I mean this is a wonderful problem to have, but the availability of dates and space. Particularly if you're a larger group, you're having to peer further and further into the future to find dates and space to accommodate those meetings.\nChad Beynon: Great. Thank you. And then secondly, just on City Express. I know that you began offering the product in North America, and we heard from one of your competitors that they were seeing some deletions in those areas. So it's certainly a good area for conversion or new build. But could you talk about any initial demand for this product here in the U.S. Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: Yeah. The demand is quite strong. We had people banging on the door saying, would you please announce the name so we can start signing deals. And we're already seeing franchise applications come in. We're seeing deals get approved, We think, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening remarks, we hope to open the first couple in the next couple of months. So exactly what we would have expected. We're seeing strong interest from both our strong portfolio of existing franchise partners. And I think our entry into the mid-scale gives us an opportunity to tap into a group of franchisees who perhaps we've not grown with in the past.\nChad Beynon: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nAnthony Capuano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. There's a lot of noise, obviously, with the corporate travel from the election, and I think there was some calendar noise in October. But if you could just strip back a lot of those onetime items like what's your general sense of overall corporate travel spend? It seems like it's simply positive and continue to kind of grind up. But just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nAnthony Capuano: Yes. I mean grind is not a bad work, but it's slow and steady in the last number of quarters, as we've talked about in each of the calls, we are encouraged by virtue of the fact that we continue to see RevPAR growth quarter-over-quarter in the business transient segment. And to me, one of the most encouraging facets of that recovery is on the big corporates. It's been several years since we already got back to above pandemic levels of travel from the small- and medium-sized companies, but the continued growth and the continued return to the road by the big corporates is an encouraging facet of the recovery.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then maybe the 219 million members, I think you mentioned on Bonvoy, what\u2019s the direct contribution now or what's OTA and just any thoughts there? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. So OTA is quite steady. So direct bookings are still in the low 70%, and that\u2019s really quite consistent. And I would say, kind of, you can say, close to 40% overall are digital. So that part, consistent, the OTA days 12% to 13% has also been quite consistent. The place that has had at the margin slightly higher, has been the GDS, which is really more of a reflection of continued return of the larger corporations doing their bookings. But could I say otherwise, great continued movement from the phone and in person to digital, but also overall, a very steady sort of low 70%s for direct bookings.\nConor Cunningham: Appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Tony Capuano for closing remarks.\nAnthony Capuano: Great. Well, again, thank you for your interest in Marriott. Thanks for your questions today. For a whole host of reasons, it\u2019s going to be a busy week for all of us, but we appreciate your interest, and we\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude the Marriott International third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Anthony Capuano",
            "content": "Thank you, Jackie. Thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which reflect continued momentum in our business. Net rooms grew nearly 6% year-over-year and development activity remained strong. Global RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter, driven by another quarter of solid rate growth with ADR up 2.5%. Globally, group was once again the top performing customer segment. Group RevPAR rose 10% year-over-year for the second quarter in a row with robust increases in both room nights and ADR. At the end of September, global group revenues were pacing roughly flat for the fourth quarter, primarily due to negative impact from the election in the U.S. and up 8% for the full year 2024. Given our industry-leading distribution of convention hotels at nearly double the number of rooms of the next closest peer, we are pleased that group strength is continuing into next year. Group revenues for 2025 were pacing up 7% at the end of the quarter, on a 3% increase in room nights and a 4% increase in average daily rate. Globally, business transient experienced another quarter of growth with third quarter RevPAR rising 2%. Leisure transient RevPAR was flat to the year ago quarter, while still well above 2019 levels. If we look at trends by region, RevPAR rose over 2% in the U.S. and Canada, driven by growth in average rate. RevPAR growth at luxury and full service hotels outperformed select service properties and weekdays surpassed weekends, reflecting strength in group and business transient compared to leisure. RevPAR grew 5% internationally, driven by 9% RevPAR increases in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in Asia Pacific, excluding China. EMEA growth was helped by the Paris Olympics and other special events, as well as solid demand from U.S. travelers. APAC strength was broad-based across the region and benefited from international guests, especially from Greater China. Cross-border travel on a global basis is now above pre-pandemic levels at just over 20% of total rooms. Greater China RevPAR declined to 8% in the third quarter as macroeconomic pressures led to weak domestic leisure demand and restricted pricing power. Severe weather and higher end guests traveling to other regions also impacted the area. Despite the demand headwinds, our hotels continue to outperform our peers, gaining RevPAR index across Greater China in the quarter. We also grew RevPAR index on a global basis. Marriott Bonvoy, our industry-leading global travel and loyalty program had a record quarter of enrollments with our membership base growing to over 219 million members at the end of September. With co-branded credit cards in 11 countries in CALA as well as numerous collaborations and thousands of Marriott Bonvoy Moments experiences, including the Taylor Swift Eras Tour sweepstakes, we are focused on enhancing engagement with our members, both on and off property. Thanks to our recent tie-up with Starbucks, even members with only one hotel stay can now redeem points for a cup of coffee. We're thrilled with our development activity. In the third quarter, we added around 16,000 net rooms, reaching more than 1.67 million rooms at nearly 9,100 properties around the world. Global signing activity has remained strong with more than 95,000 organic rooms signed year-to-date in 2024. Compared to a quarter ago, our pipeline grew 5% to a record 585,000 rooms. Our momentum in conversions, including multiunit opportunities continues to reflect owner preference for our brands worldwide. In August, we announced a multiunit conversion deal with Sonder for 9,000 existing rooms and a few thousand more in the pipeline. This deal expands our portfolio of longer stay accommodations in key global markets, including New York and Dubai. In the third quarter, conversions represented over 30% of room additions and over 50% of signs. In October, we announced City Express by Marriott as the brand name of our new transient mid-scale product here in the U.S. and in Canada. With its highly effective operating model, an outstanding value proposition, we have already received extensive interest from owners. We expect to have signed agreements and even a few openings over the next few months. Our progress in the mid-scale space around the world has been outstanding, and we look forward to meaningfully enhancing our presence in this high growth segment of the market. Our strong 2024 net rooms growth and signings performance is exciting, and I'm proud of our associates for their work in driving preference for our brands among both guests and owners. Marriott Bonvoy has never been stronger, and we look forward to further expanding our presence around the world. Our business momentum is excellent and as a company that embraces change, we continue to evolve our business to support our global growth. To this end, we have undertaken an enterprise-wide process to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the company. We want to further empower our teams closest to our markets guests, owners and franchisees to operate even more nimbly. While this work is not yet complete, we believe these efforts will drive increased profitability and enhanced value. I will now turn the call over to Leeny, who will share more details and then walk through our financial results and updated guidance. Leeny? Thanks, Stephen. Maybe I'll take the first part of your question, and then turn it over to Leeny. I think the impetus is -- maybe I'll start at 100,000 feet. One of the company's core values is this notion of always embracing change. And we think right now, we operate from a position of strength. The business has really strong momentum, as Leeny just described. Then the company is quite different than the last time we looked holistically at the organization. You think about the changes in the company over the last decade. We've more than doubled in size over the last decade. We've entered over 60 new countries now operating in 142 countries. And so it felt like the right time to really look across the enterprise and figure out what adjustments we can make to enhance and improve our efficiency. In terms of run rate, Leeny, you want to take that? Yeah. So in terms of -- we're in the early stages of the 2025 budget process. I think that the visibility that we have so far underpins Leeny's comment about our confidence in the three year CAGR that we laid out during the Security Analyst Meeting. On the fees per room question, that's obviously something we're digging into. And if you look at fees per room for RevPAR related fees, pulling out the non-RevPAR as they tend to grow faster. Both in '24 and in '25, we see average fees per room growing, which might seem a little counterintuitive given our push into midscale, but I think there are two principal drivers there. Number one, we continue to see really strong momentum in the luxury tier, which drives outsized fees. And as Leeny talked about, we continue to see strong growth in incentive management fees. You're welcome. Sure. So let me try and remind me, if I've missed your few questions embedded in there. On the first one, stimulus. We're watching so closely, most the stimulus so far, really has not been to the direct benefit of the consumer. So we're not seeing any sort of immediate and material impact on performance metrics. The thing that is more interesting to me, not a great deal of stimulus or support for the property sector, which is obviously under quite a bit of duress, but despite that lack of stimulus to support the property sector, we talked about this last quarter as well. We continue to see really strong both signings and openings volume across Greater China. I think some of that is because we're seeing a real acceleration in our select service brands, which are marginally easier to get done from a capital staff perspective. But the short answer to your question is really not much yet in terms of the impact of stimulus. You're absolutely right when we think about visibility expectations about performance in China are really all over the board. And as Leeny mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're early in the process. What I would say to you is right now, as we start to peak into 2025. Absent any more significant stimulus it could be as good as flat going into '25. But again, that's a very early peak into the performance. Thanks, Patrick. Yeah. So we're looking at efficiencies and savings that we think will have clear benefits to the owners. We're looking at every facet of our engagement with them, and we expect to have some tangible saving opportunities identified for them in the very near future. Maybe the only thing I would add, Rob, and we talked about this last quarter, as Leeny points out, the overall percentage of deals where we're using key money hasn't changed really at all. We are seeing selectively key money being used in a broader section of quality tiers than maybe we have in the past. Good morning. Of course, yeah, we haven't talked about that yet. And again, we're relatively early in the process. But our takeaway from that early set of discussions, we are targeting a mid-single digit increase for 2025. And I think the teams are feeling pretty good about that target. Yeah, Brandt. And the bulk would be, of course. I mean they look at every variable in the equation that impacts their returns. I think they are encouraged that the Fed did a 50 bp drop. They are obviously on pins and needles waiting to see what action the Fed takes through the balance of this year. But I would say to you, availability of debt and an elevated construction cost environment are bigger impediments to driving the sort of construction start volume, and we saw pre-pandemic than the current level of interest rates. Yeah. So as we said a quarter ago, you should reasonably expect the vast majority of our new units to be the sort of traditional management agreements and franchise agreements that you've seen when you hear Leeny talk about our three year CAGR 5% to 5.5% growth in NUG. That is really predicated on that traditional model of management agreements and franchise agrees. What I will say is, and maybe I'll pull MGM and Sonder apart because they're a bit unique. Everybody seems to lump those together, Sonder is really structured like a very traditional franchise agreement. MGM is different in that we brought together two powerhouse families of brands and to pull those two brands together, necessitated some real creativity in terms of structuring from both sides. But I will say, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the really extraordinary momentum that Bonvoy has and so certainly, we'll continue to get inquiries from prospective partners that want to take advantage of that momentum and we'll apply the same rigor and the same lens that we always have in evaluating those opportunities. Yeah. So I think what I would say, Michael, the growing our market share is obviously a top priority for us, and it will continue to be. The growth potential we see across our family of brands, including the more recent entrants in mid-scale is really strong, and we think we have a really competitive offering to the franchise community. We continue to be optimistic about those growth prospects as you heard Leeny described, and we certainly think this initiative will add incremental support to that growth. And then I'm sorry, the second question, Michael? Yeah. I mean, I think in Leeny's prepared remarks, she talked a little bit about that. The momentum that we continue to see in conversions is really encouraging, both single asset and multi-unit. And maybe I think I said this a quarter or two ago, but I'll reiterate it. I think it's a combination of factors. I think we have, as strong portfolio of conversion friendly brands as we've had in my 30 years with the company. I think the teams are much more focused on removing friction from the conversion process. And we've got Leeny has dedicated resources in each of the continents that are singularly focused on driving conversion volume. And so we expect that conversion activity to continue at pace. And Duane, part of your question was around anything that's been a surprise. I don't know that I would characterize it as a surprise. But the continued strength quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year of group is a really encouraging sign. I mean we spent \u2013 all of us spend a lot of time with both corporate and association meeting planners and the appetite they have for group meeting just continues to be at the high end of our expectations, and it's really encouraging. And as I mentioned in my open particularly given the composition of our portfolio and our significant lead in our group hotel portfolio, that's a really terrific trend for our business. Yeah. Thank you, Lizzie. Of course, we spend an enormous amount of time in looking at the consumer from every possible angle. But I'll go to the ancillary spend since that was a topic we talked about a quarter ago. When you look globally, you almost have to bifurcate it and look at food beverage for meetings and events versus food and beverage and outlets and lounges. Food beverage for meetings and events continues to be quite strong. We are seeing a little bit of pullback on outlets and lounges, still growing and growing materially, but maybe not quite as strong as we saw. The one thing I would tell you, though, is we're not seeing that weakness in spending from customers of luxury hotels. When you look at outlets and lounge revenue for the third quarter at our luxury hotels. Now this excludes Greater China for some of the reasons we discussed earlier. But if you look at our global luxury portfolio ex-China, we actually saw spending in outlets and balances in the luxury portfolio, up 2%, which was the same increase we saw a quarter ago. So we'll continue to watch it, but that's pretty encouraging for us. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chad. I would say both. We are seeing companies who have been traveling and meeting, building out their calendar of meetings. And we are seeing some of our partners who perhaps were on pause starting to schedule. And I think some of that is driven by -- I mean this is a wonderful problem to have, but the availability of dates and space. Particularly if you're a larger group, you're having to peer further and further into the future to find dates and space to accommodate those meetings. Yeah. The demand is quite strong. We had people banging on the door saying, would you please announce the name so we can start signing deals. And we're already seeing franchise applications come in. We're seeing deals get approved, We think, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening remarks, we hope to open the first couple in the next couple of months. So exactly what we would have expected. We're seeing strong interest from both our strong portfolio of existing franchise partners. And I think our entry into the mid-scale gives us an opportunity to tap into a group of franchisees who perhaps we've not grown with in the past. You're welcome. Yes. I mean grind is not a bad work, but it's slow and steady in the last number of quarters, as we've talked about in each of the calls, we are encouraged by virtue of the fact that we continue to see RevPAR growth quarter-over-quarter in the business transient segment. And to me, one of the most encouraging facets of that recovery is on the big corporates. It's been several years since we already got back to above pandemic levels of travel from the small- and medium-sized companies, but the continued growth and the continued return to the road by the big corporates is an encouraging facet of the recovery. Great. Well, again, thank you for your interest in Marriott. Thanks for your questions today. For a whole host of reasons, it's going to be a busy week for all of us, but we appreciate your interest, and we'll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. At this point in the process, we expect these efforts to yield $80 million to $90 million of annual pre-tax general and administrative cost reductions beginning in 2025. In addition, we expect to deliver cost savings to our owners and franchisees. This initiative is anticipated to result in roughly $100 million of charges, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2024. The charges will be recorded in restructuring and merger related charges and in reimbursed expenses. With meaningful growth opportunities around the world across are more than 30 brands, we're confident these efforts will make us even more competitive. Now turning to our third quarter results. Gross fee revenues rose 7% in the quarter to $1.28 billion. The increase reflects higher global RevPAR, rooms growth and increase in residential branding fees helped by timing and higher co-brand credit card fees. IMF grew 11% to $159 million. Growth in IMF was led by higher fees in the U.S. and Canada as well as strong growth in APAC and CALA, partially offset by a $5 million decline in Greater China. G&A in the quarter rose 15%, primarily due to a $19 million operating profit guarantee reserve for a U.S. hotel, which was negotiated in connection with the company's acquisition of Starwood as well as an $11 million litigation reserve. Even with these $31 million of reserves, third quarter adjusted EBITDA grew faster than gross fees, rising 8% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.26. Now let's talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 2% to 3% in the fourth quarter, and we still assume 3% to 4% growth for the full year. In the fourth quarter, RevPAR growth is anticipated to be higher in most international markets than in the U.S. and Canada. Fourth quarter RevPAR growth in the U.S. and Canada is currently expected to be generally in line with the third quarter, with strong leisure and BP trends in October, offsetting weakness in November due to tomorrow's election. The election impact on U.S. and Canada RevPAR is forecasted to be around negative 300 basis points in November and negative 100 basis points for the quarter, double that of past election cycles as we have meaningfully lower transient and group room nights on the books for both this week and next. Greater China is still expected to post negative RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year as a result of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region. In the fourth quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 4% to 5% range. Compared to our July guidance, fees are expected to be impacted by softer performance at certain hotels under renovation and lower than previously forecasted residential branding fees due to timing. Our owned, leased and other revenue, net of expenses, could total roughly $95 million. For the full year, gross fees are anticipated to grow 6% to 7% to $5.13 billion to $5.15 billion. Unleased and other revenues net of expenses could total around $346 million. We now expect full year G&A expense can rise 4% to 5% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to total $4.93 billion to $4.96 billion, a 6% to 7% increase over 2023. 2024 adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be between $9.19 and $9.27 with a 25% assumed tax rate. We're now forecasting full year investment spending of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, this year's spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multiyear transformation of our property management, reservations and loyalty systems the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. The rollout of these platforms is slated to begin later next year, and we look forward to the many benefits that should accrue from elevating from three major tech platforms. Our powerful asset light business model generates a great deal of cash and our philosophy on allocating that capital remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade ratings and investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through share repurchases and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We now expect to return approximately $4.4 billion to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago expected to occur later this month. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust development activity across our global portfolio. This summer, we raised our full year 2024 net room guidance to 6% to 6.5% growth after signing the Sonder deal. With increased visibility, we now anticipate 2024 routes growth at the top end of this range or around 6.5%. We still expect net rooms to grow at a solid three year CAGR of 5% to 5.5% from year end 2022 to year end 2025. Thank you for your continued interest in Marriott, and Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Yeah. So thanks, Stephen. I think, first of all, let me talk a little bit about the 80 to 90, and that is really thinking about savings off of our current cost base. So when we think about moving forward, we've talked to you over time about a kind of typical longer-term run rate of inflation plus perhaps a point or so to support above average growth. And from that perspective, I think it's too early for us to give any specifics about next year. We're really just beginning our full loan budget process, but really think about that 80 to 90 as being off of our current run rate. Good morning, Shaun. Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Yeah. We've had this conversation a number of times, which is, I think when you look at it quarter-to-quarter, it's very hard to see the overall fee because there are just a typical loneliness that comes with IMF, for example, you heard about the lower year-over-year IMF and IMF rich territory like Greater China, you've obviously got things like renovation impact, which are very important overall to the health of portfolio, and we're really excited about what those renovations will produce. But when you put that all together, combined it with a little bit of FX, etc., quarter-over-quarter, it is absolutely going to be lumpy. We do believe that this algorithm works over time. But then you do have a bit of the ramp-up issue as well as variations in RevPAR that can make it tougher just in one quarter. But again, as we look forward, really pleased with what we see in terms of the rooms that are coming on to the system. As we've talked about before, room signings are very strong this year. When you look at kind of year-over-year where we are and the strength of the conversions coming in the system, we do see that, that equation going forward looks pretty good. Right. So I think, generally, your philosophy is right, Shaun. I want to caveat that, though, we are way too early to be giving specifics about how you should come up with that number. We modestly got to look at all the elements of the different pieces that go into G&A. As you'll probably remember, we've also got normal increases in bad debt that come with the growth of the overall portfolio, etc., etc. So it's not quite as simple as you're describing. But philosophically, you are right that, that $31 million was not anticipated and not expected in normal run rate G&A. But right now, that 80 to 90 comes right out of this year's run rate. The only thing that I would add to that is that we get into the weeds of looking at Q3 and Q4 is that the margin, Greater China RevPAR has been slightly better than we expected a quarter ago as we move through Q3 and as we looked into October, and one of the things that is interesting is, we are starting to see a slight pickup in cross-border travel into the Tier 1 cities, kind of classic BT. Now again, it's only quite marginal because as you saw, RevPAR was down meaningfully in Q3, and we do expect that to continue. But at the margin, slightly better than we thought. Yeah. The operating profit guarantee has nothing to do with IMF. When you look at IMF in Q3, it was the U.S. and Canada that was the outperformer, kind of a couple of different reasons. There was one element that was related to some insurance payments made from prior hurricanes, but also very good strong performance on the part of our large city managed hotels, which helped a bit. And then obviously, you see in APAC as well. We have good growth in our Asia Pacific outside of China IMF. Just to give you kind of a little bit of a sense overall, 22% of our hotels in the U.S. and Canada that are managed, paid an incentive fee in Q3, that's the same percentage as a quarter ago. So think of that as fairly consistent. And then outside the U.S., also still quite strong. I think Greater China was the one change where a little bit lower as a result of their continued weakness in RevPAR. As we look at Q4, that's where I think you see, when you look at the fee guidance that we gave, you actually see a little bit of this reverse from a standpoint that several of the hotels undergoing renovation will mean that we expect IMF to be a little bit weaker than a quarter ago as a result of that even though RevPAR is largely the same in U.S. and Canada. Yeah. Sure, Robin. Good morning. Yes. I would say more of the same. We've talked about this for several quarters from a standpoint that perhaps over a number of years. We've seen a bit more key money across more tiers. But I think more importantly, when you look about the percentage of fuels using key money that still is about the same at about a third of deals and when we think about the amount of key money per deal, also quite similar. So we are seeing trends that would mean you need to think about kind of meaningful increases in that element of our investment profile. Sure. No, the business interruption immaterial, they're way too small to mention, it's in the laundry list of things that provide an outperformance in the U.S. and Canada. So really nothing that you would need to adjust out. We -- again, as you always know, quarter-to-quarter, you can have kind of variations on exactly what you're expecting to earn from a hotels. So really no numbers that would be meaningful at all. Yes, you're absolutely right. This was an unusual operating profit guarantee that was part of the settlement that we did in the acquisition of Starwood with an owner and meaningfully longer than a typical operating profit guarantee is for us. It was actually a total of a $70 million operating profit guarantee. This now takes us up to the MAX exposure that we have on that guarantee. And really, to your point, reflected the fact that we had a number of years and COVID to work through to have a view as to whether we would need to actually fund under that guarantee. So once we came out of COVID and could look forward over a number of years, we made the determination that we needed to take that reserve, but that is it. And to your point, no, we do not have a remaining operating profit guarantees with that kind of length and size of exposure. Yeah. The $80 million to $90 million, just to be clear, we do believe that is in '25. So that, that is beginning in '25 off of this year's cost base. Now we obviously have all the normal other parts that you have to look in your budget for G&A, and that's the part that we're in the process of Joe. So I think at this point, we're really pointing to a sustainable $80 million to $90 million in annual G&A cost savings. Yeah. No, and last, of course, as always, something comes up that, that we're not currently planning for, I totally agree with you that you would expect both $200 million that is included in that number related to the purchase of Chicago. Grand Sheridan as well as a $50 million land purchase that we made in Q3 for the Westin Peachtree, which really was to help us remove the lack of clarity around a ground lease that made it difficult for any owner to know with the long-term kind of cash stream from that asset could be. So that -- with that cleared up, that's terrific and that really is $250 million that, to your point, is not expected to be ongoing. Just to add to that is that was definitely something we noticed was helpful this quarter with the continued strengthening of [indiscernible] that, that ADR continues to be useful. Sure. So as you heard us say earlier that Q3 leisure transact was roughly flat to last year, although, well for 2019 levels. I think from a chain scale perspective, basically flat or slightly growing with luxury and premium, while really select service is where you saw a slight decline. No. I'll say a couple of things. I think the reality is, we're in the middle of our budget process, which I'm happy to say is very granular and gets down to the property level and exactly what's going on in every environment. I think the broadest comment I would make is we see 2025 barring some major economic change to be more of the same. So if you think about kind of our back half of our RevPAR this year and how we're looking at 2025, I think you probably see some quite similar trends. where when you think BT continues on, group still very strong. We've talked about these upper-single digits group pace for next year. And that would then mean that leisure we'd be up slightly, but also probably not taking a big jump up. And again, we will be getting much more into that in February when we've gone through the budget. But I would say, '25 looks a whole lot like the back half of '24 from where we sit today. Yeah. So we are -- the three biggest items there are obviously the credit cards, residential and timeshare. And I think the one that really jumps out is what was going on with the residential branding fees, which, as you know, can be quite lumpy because if a whole development sells out. So as an example, in Q3 '24, that was $18 million, while a year ago in Q3, it was $7 million. So it more than doubled in one quarter. Credit card fees was the more stereotypical growth and timeshare tends to be fairly flattish given the structure of that contract. So you put it all together, but yes, for the full year, we continue to see the top end of single digits, 9% to 10% is the right growth range. So I'll start and then I'll have Tony jump in. I do think part of what we saw in '24 is the continued normalization in the U.S. and Canada. So for example, in leisure, you've definitely got in Q3. Year-to-date, actually, the leisure guidance are flat to a year ago in the U.S. and Canada. Overall RevPAR is also year-to-date roughly flat in the U.S. in leisure. And that, I really ascribed to quite a bit of normalization. As you think about people kind of coming out of COVID and frankly, wanting to go anywhere, anytime, kind of no matter what to make sure that they were able to get their trial done. And I think that is normalizing a bit. While what you also saw was a business transient group kind of filling in to make up for where that slowdown was happening. So you actually look overall, and overall, in Q3, you saw room nights for year-to-date in the U.S. and Canada, up 1% and ADR up 2%. So in that regard, I think you continue to see a healthy series of demand. We believe that going forward, you're going to continue to see travel be a priority for our customers, whether it is group, BT or leisure. And of course, it has a relationship to the macroeconomic environment that's been proven in our industry cycle-in and cycle-out. But we would expect to continue to see with a strong economy, strong demand for our business. Yeah. No, I think our -- as I was saying in my comments, our philosophy is exactly the same, which is, we are a growth company. We are all about investing in valuable growth for the enterprise and continuing to take market share around the world. We are blessed with a business model that produces more cash than we need to provide that growth. And so from that perspective, we would expect to continue to stay very solidly in the investment-grade leverage range and return excess capital to our shareholders. So certainly, all the time, the reality is, we're looking at that all the time and evaluating what makes the most sense. As you've heard us talk about the W Union Square as well as the elegant portfolio in Barbados. We are nearing the end of the renovation of those properties and obviously, would look to take advantage of what we expect to be very strong performance on the part of those -- that portfolio in that hotel. And so as we move forward, depending on the financing environment and the appetite between as always, buyers and sellers, we will take advantage of that. So we're always searching for that. Well, you have to know. Yes, on the ones that are finishing up, but we've always got hotels going under renovation. But -- and we obviously will be carefully looking at that as we go through the budgeting process and looking at our fee guidance for next year. I don't expect Lizzie that it would impact things meaningfully. Yeah. So OTA is quite steady. So direct bookings are still in the low 70%, and that's really quite consistent. And I would say, kind of, you can say, close to 40% overall are digital. So that part, consistent, the OTA days 12% to 13% has also been quite consistent. The place that has had at the margin slightly higher, has been the GDS, which is really more of a reflection of continued return of the larger corporations doing their bookings. But could I say otherwise, great continued movement from the phone and in person to digital, but also overall, a very steady sort of low 70%s for direct bookings."

We delivered another strong quarter as travel demand remained robust in most markets around the world. And our net rooms grew by 6% year-over-year. Second quarter global RevPAR rose nearly 5%. Average daily rate increased around 3% and occupancy reached 73%, up about 150 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. RevPAR rose nearly 4% in the US and Canada, benefiting from the shift of the Easter holiday. All chain scales in the US and Canada, from select service to luxury, posted positive second quarter year-over-year RevPAR. RevPAR increased over 7% internationally, led by a remarkable 13% RevPAR gain in Asia Pacific excluding China or APEC. APEC benefited from strong macro trends and increased cross-border travel, especially from Mainland China. Growth in APEC was broad-based but particularly robust in Japan where RevPAR rose 21%. RevPAR grew nearly 10% in the EMEA region with continued strong regional and cross-border demand and about 9% in the CALA region. To date in 2024, the City Express portfolio has meaningfully outperformed the overall Mexican market as well as our own internal RevPAR expectation, and Bonvoy penetration of the hotels continues to improve steadily. RevPAR in Greater China declined roughly 4% in the quarter, as macroeconomic pressures led to softer domestic demand. The region was also impacted by an increase in outbound high-end travelers. Positive RevPAR growth in Tier 1 cities, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan was more than offset by declines in all other markets, with Hainan seeing a meaningful RevPAR decline. Despite the adverse market conditions, we outperformed our peers and gained RevPAR index across the region in the second quarter. Our global RevPAR index, which is at a substantial premium, also rose again in the quarter. As we look ahead to the full year, we are narrowing our global RevPAR range to 3% to 4% growth, largely due to anticipated continued weakness in Greater China, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. On a global basis, in the second quarter, we saw RevPAR growth across all three of our customer segments, group, leisure transient, and business transient, with each segment experiencing increases in both room nights and average daily rate. Group, which comprised 24% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, remained the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year-ago quarter, group RevPAR rose 10% globally. Full-year 2024 worldwide group revenues were still pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the second quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in ADR. Business transient, which contributed 33% of global room nights in the quarter, saw a 4% increase in RevPAR. Leisure transient, which accounted for 43% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, posted a 2% rise in RevPAR. Within the business transient segment, demand from small and medium sized corporates, which now account for nearly 55% of business transient room nights, has grown significantly over the last few years. Earlier this month we announced Business Access by Marriott Bonvoy, a new comprehensive online booking travel program that we launched to ease and expand the booking experience and travel management process for these customers. While it is still early days, this new offering is already seeing great interest, and we're extremely pleased with the initial account signups and users of the platform, both of which have outpaced expectations. We continue to enhance our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which had over 210 million members at the end of June. We continue to see real success driving enrollments and engagement internationally, in part due to our Bonvoy partnerships with Rakuten in Japan, Alibaba in China, and Rappi in CALA. Member penetration of global room nights rose again, reaching new record highs in the second quarter at 71% in the US and Canada, and 65% globally. Our new collaboration with Starbucks is the latest example of how we're connecting our members with people, places, and passions that they truly love. We also remain laser focused on providing our guests with excellent experiences in our hotels and are pleased with our intent to recommend sports which have continued to steadily rise. Our leading global portfolio continues to grow meaningfully faster than overall industry supply and we added approximately 15,500 net rooms to end the quarter with nearly 1.66 million rooms. Global signing activity has remained strong. Record signings in APEC and Greater China for the first half of the year helped grow our pipeline to over 559,000 rooms around the world. Conversions, including multi-unit opportunities, remain a significant driver of growth as owners continue to value the depth and breadth of our brand portfolio and our powerful revenue engines. In the second quarter, conversions represented 37% of openings and 32% of signings. This conversion activity has been broad based with hotels converting into 23 different Marriott brands over the last 12 months. While still below 2019 levels, we're also pleased with the continued upward trend in monthly construction starts. In the second quarter, construction starts in the US and Canada rose 40% year-over-year. In June, we signed three marquee luxury conversion deals in the US. The renowned, The Resort at Pelican Hill in Newport Beach, California, and The Luxury Collection Hotel Manhattan Midtown have already joined our system. The iconic Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii is joining the Ritz-Carlton brand today. We are thrilled to welcome these incredible properties as we further extend our global leading position in the high value luxury segment. Our momentum in the mid-scale space is excellent. Developers are showing significant interest in our new brands in the tier. City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express by Sheraton, StudioRes, and our latest transient conversion friendly brand in the US. In CALA, we continue to sign deals for City Express and are engaged in numerous discussions across the region. Our first Four Points Express opened in Turkey and over a dozen hotels from our recent multi-unit conversion deal in APEC are expected to join our system later this year. We're also in talks for StudioRes hotels in over 300 markets and we continue to execute on and pursue numerous types of opportunities, from large development deals to one-off projects. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the hard work they do each and every day to advance our business and help connect people through the power of travel. Leeny?\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Second quarter gross fee revenues rose 7% year-over-year to $1.34 billion. The increase reflects stronger global RevPAR, rooms growth, and a higher non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Co-branded credit card fees rose 10%, and residential branding fees were significantly higher than in the same quarter last year, as we continue to benefit from our top position in branded residences globally. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, totaled $195 million in the second quarter. Growth in these fees was led by mid-teens percentage increases in APEC and EMEA, partially offset by an $8 million decline in Greater China. IMFs in the US and Canada were flat year-over-year, in part impacted by continued softness in Hawaii. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9% to $1.32 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 11% to $2.50. Now, let's talk about our outlook for 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 3% to 4% in the third quarter and for the full year. RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in the vast majority of our international markets than in the US and Canada. The primary change in our four-year outlook is Greater China's updated expectation of negative RevPAR growth for the rest of the year. We expect a continuation of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region, with the third quarter anticipated to see the most meaningful RevPAR decline as outbound travel accelerates during summer holidays. Note that given Greater China's lower overall average RevPAR compared to the rest of our system, it typically makes up around 7% of RevPAR-related fees, although it accounts for 10% of open rooms. While we also expect marginally lower full-year RevPAR in the US and Canada than we had previously anticipated, in part due to less group business the first two weeks of November, given the intense focus on the US presidential election, overall RevPAR trends in the US and Canada in the back half of the year are expected to remain relatively steady with the first six months of the year. On customer segment, worldwide RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. In the third quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Our owned lease and other revenues net of expenses are anticipated to be roughly $75 million. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 7% to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Compared to last quarter's expectations, roughly two-thirds of the reductions is from IMFs, largely from Greater China and select markets in the US and Canada like Hawaii and Washington, DC. There's also additional negative currency impact from a still strong dollar, as well as well as slightly lower than previously expected non-RevPAR related franchise fees, and the timing of hotel openings. Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $345 million to $350 million. We now expect full year G&A expense could rise just 1% to 2% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 6% and 8% to roughly $4.95 billion to $5 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%. 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.23 and $9.40. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust signings and openings activity across our global portfolio, demonstrating owners and franchisees continued confidence in our brand's performance. We're focused on driving strong growth and still expect full-year net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. Full-year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. As you'll recall, this spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multi-year transformation of our property management, reservations, and loyalty systems, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. We look forward to the many benefits expected to accrue from elevating our three major tech platforms. Our investment spending outlook also incorporates roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio, including renovation spending for the W Union Square in Manhattan and the Elegant portfolio in Barbados. When all renovations are complete, we'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts for these properties. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We continue to generate strong levels of cash, including from our loyalty program, and our leverage ratio remains at the low end of our target range of 3 times to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. We currently expect approximately $4.3 billion of capital returns to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago. In closing, we have a lot of momentum in our business and strong growth prospects across our over 30 brands around the world, thanks to our terrific team. As we look ahead, we're incredibly optimistic about Marriott's future. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess on the guidance in the second half, it looks like you kind of lowered overall RevPAR by about 50 basis points, the reduction in EBITDA about 2%. I realize that a lot of that looks like it's incentive management fee related, but is that the appropriate kind of operating leverage to consider going forward? And what levers do you have to pull if you were to see the backdrop deteriorate further and try to take additional action?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. Thanks, Stephen. So a couple of things in that question. One is the reality that when we typically talk about 1 point of RevPAR being $50 million to $60 million in fees, that's assuming that that's equally across all markets around the world and doesn't have any FX impact. And so I think you are clearly seeing with the drop that we talked today that the impact of the change in our outlook for Greater China has a disproportionate impact. When I think about Greater China's mix between base fees and IMFs, it's obviously quite different than it is in the US where you have an owner's priority return. So for 1 point of RevPAR in Greater China, that is typically something more like $3 [million] (ph) in fees, which is going to be more heavily weighted towards IMFs than it would be in the US where it would have a dramatically smaller impact. So I think we really have to look at the geography rather than necessarily just thinking about it as being a half point overall because it is overwhelmingly related to Greater China with just a slight, truly a tad bit lower expectation in the US and Canada.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe one kind of unrelated, could be related follow-up is just there was always in these questions around fees per room and how the NUG plus RevPAR translates to overall fees. There's a lot of puts and takes in the quarter, but has anything changed in your thought processes as we look at the longer term algorithm, as we think about that fees being related to net unit growth plus RevPAR?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, no, we think you're absolutely right. We believe the algorithm absolutely holds up over time. You do have, as you described, the impact of certain elements changing unevenly. So in this particular situation, it is one market having a potentially large change in expected RevPAR for the rest of the year. But we've talked before about our expectation of fees per key as actually rising over time, especially as we think about also having our rapidly growing non-RevPAR fees. So we're very pleased with those continuing trends and do not believe that the fundamental algorithm is any different.\nStephen Grambling: Great, thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nLeeny Oberg: Hey, Shaun.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, Leeny. Just wanted to start with the RevPAR guidance. So if we kind of take the pieces here, obviously we know where we came in the first half of the year and you've given us color on Q3. I believe in the prepared remarks you said Q3 would be the weakest point for China, but when we kind of do the pieces, I think Q4, the implied guidance is below Q3. So what's driving that sort of weaker Q4? Is it group timing? Is it some other shift?Leeny, you mentioned the election, but I think you also said US is pretty stable. So kind of what's driving? Check the math, but if the math is right, what's driving the weaker Q4? Is there anything in that Q4 run rate anybody needs to be concerned about or aware of?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, thank you, Shaun, and you're right. We can point out that kind of an interesting distinction there between Q3 and Q4. With China only being roughly 10% of our rooms, that impact of the lowest quarter in the back half of the year being Q3 doesn't have that much of an impact on Q4. What's going on on Q4 is as we described that we are seeing a bit lower group bookings specifically in Q4 around the election, which is having an impact on the expectations for US and Canada in Q4 versus Q3, though as we described when we look at the entire back half of the year, we do expect to see really a similar sort of RevPAR growth number as you see in the first half of the year. And then on top of that, you've got your other international markets just continuing to normalize. So when I look at the first half of APEC and EMEA and CALA, I would expect that their back half is a little bit lower. And so in that regard, as you move towards Q4, you continue to see additional normalization, although still quite strong RevPAR in those markets. And you put all that together and that's where you get the bit lower outlook for RevPAR in Q4 than Q3.\nTony Capuano: And maybe just to add a little more context to that, Shaun, the -- obviously we knew there was an election this year and baked what we've seen as historical softness. But when you look back over prior election cycles, we tended to see a little bit of group softness the week of election. Given for the unique attributes of this election cycle, we're seeing that bleed into the week after the election as well. So it's from a group perspective, about half of November is feeling the impact on the group side.\nShaun Kelley: Great, thanks. And just as my follow-up just to kind of hit on China specifically, obviously I think you gave us a little bit of the heads-up that this was softening last quarter. The real question, though, I expect we'll get some, is this bleeding it all into the development side, right? The signings and the development side was a highlight for the quarter broadly, but what do you think on the ground there, and is that softness at all starting to impact developer conversations or signing conversations in Greater China?\nTony Capuano: It's a great question and it's sort of an interesting riddle. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we had record signings in the first half of the year in China. I think it's really about the long-term prospects in China. Our owner community, certainly the SOEs there, continue to believe in the long-term dynamics of travel, and continue to both sign and start constructing them. So we really have seen no slowdown at all on that front. In fact, it's interesting, we signed 63 select service deals in the first half of the year in China. Almost half of those are expected to open within 12 months. So as we look at the pace, we ask the same question as you. Are we stacking paper or are we signing deals that are going to materialize as openings? And the pace of construction is really encouraging.\nLeeny Oberg: And the only thing I'll add is that I think with our continued strength in RevPAR index in Greater China, especially as you see demand softening over the past six months or so, we have seen increased owner appetite for being with the really strong brands that we have and across the full range of brands. So we're really pleased to see kind of from the limited service segment all the way up through luxury, the really strong demand for the brands, including conversions in China, I think really demonstrating that it's frankly in the weaker times that sometimes the brands can prove the most powerful.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you a little bit more on -- you mentioned some weakness in Hawaii and I just was wondering, are you seeing it across all regions or is it maybe more isolated in Maui with what's been going on there? And is it sort of leisure or is it sort of group consensus, meaning, what's sort of driving relative weakness in that region?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, sure, Smedes, and yes, I think, I think Maui is definitely still seeing the slowest recovery. You still have the reality that the dollar is very strong, and Hawaii has been always been a very popular place for Japanese travelers. And so we overall in Hawaii, we've still not seen the level of Japanese travelers back in the state. But obviously, the tragedy in Lahaina has clearly had a huge impact on the island. And while we were there with Tony, with the senior team, a couple of weeks ago, and there's been fabulous progress, and it is really coming along well. But clearly still that island in particular is having a slower recovery than the other parts of Hawaii. But Hawaii overall is still feeling the impact of the strong dollar.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned that IMF fees were flat in North America. I think can you just remind us, what percentage of your system in North America is currently paying IMF?\nLeeny Oberg: Sure, absolutely. So interestingly, it's the same percentage as a year ago in the second quarter. 26% of the hotels in the US are paying incentive fees in the second quarter. And just as a reference point, in China, in Greater China, we went from 86% to 80%. So you see that really large delta given the structure of the management agreements. Overall for managed contracts for Marriott, we went from 62% paying incentive fees last year in the second quarter to 61% this year. So you can see that in the US it's fairly steady and more limited to certain pockets geographically that weren't quite as strong.\nSmedes Rose: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Good morning, everybody.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Good morning. Your gross fee guidance for the full year is lowered by about $50 million to $100 million versus what you gave in May. I was hoping you could break that out between the net impact from China, the election impact in the US, and FX.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, so let's do this. IMFs are definitely two-thirds of that. And I would say if you're looking at that, a solid half, if not a bit more, is from greater China. Now that you've got to get into how much is the RevPAR versus how much is FX, and there is a bit of both. Then you're also looking in IMF at some in the US, which let's call it, broadly speaking, roughly $10 million, from various markets not performing as well as we expected a quarter ago. Then you've got also FX overall is affecting both some base fees and IMFs. So to separate it out, you get into -- a bit into kind of which element are you describing. But I would say that China is the biggest impact on the change in IMFs, which is two-thirds of the overall $75 million in reduction. And then you've got a bit from the US and a bit from FX. Obviously, the lower RevPAR globally has a little bit of impact, and then ever so -- truly ever so slightly is related to non-RevPAR fees.\nJoe Greff: Great. I think, Tony, your prepared remarks talk about construction starts in the US and Canada of 40% year-over-year. And we're hearing that from others as well. Can you talk about construction starts outside the US, how that has been trending?\nTony Capuano: Yeah, of course. So as I said, here in the US, up about 40%, which is really encouraging. In greater China, I might refer to the comment I made earlier. Again, in China, as you know, oftentimes projects that come to us are well under construction. So we tend to look more at what percentage of those deals might open within 12 months of signing and to see nearly half in greater China is really encouraging. In APEC, Asia Pacific excluding China, there is still some challenges getting projects financed, and there's a continued wait for a little easing in the interest rate environment. And in EMEA, you've got a similar circumstance. Financing is continuing to be a bit of an impediment. But despite everything I just described between all of the regions that we talked about, construction starts on a global basis are up that same number about 40%. And the other thing I would tell you is the combination of some improvement in construction start activity and continued really strong performance on the conversion side, we've now had 27 straight quarters with about 200,000 rooms or more under construction. So even with really strong openings, we continue to see those starts fuel the under-construction pipeline.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you very much.\nTony Capuano: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. What I wanted to do was just get a little further insight on the NUG guidance broadly speaking, which is the same. And the makeup of that NUG where we're focused on, let's say, the MGM deal, which is a sort of different kind of fee structure than what you have. And should we be looking at that NUG in that pipeline through a more updated lens where there are going to be more of those kinds of deals in there and just thinking about how we model fees in response to that NUG over time, if my question is clear enough?\nTony Capuano: Yeah, it is. And I think the short answer is, I don't think it should cause you to think materially differently about our NUG, about the value of our NUG, about our fee structures. MGM was an extraordinarily exciting and unique opportunity to bring two powerhouse sets of brands together and that caused us to be creative on the deal structure. But the vast majority, almost the entirety of the pipeline, fits squarely in our traditional approach to managed and franchise deals.\nLeeny Oberg: The only thing I would add, David, is that we are really pleased with the number of multi-unit deals that we're signing. But overwhelmingly, they're multi-unit franchise or managed deals that are typical, but they just represent an owner wanting to sign a number of properties up with Marriott rather than a onesie or a twosie. So in that regard, it's great for our growth, and we're really pleased with the continuation of those relationships, but they don't represent a fundamental change in the nature of the agreement.\nDavid Katz: That's really, really helpful. Can -- while we're on the subject, as my follow-up, could we just touch on the MGM deal and talk about how it's going, any data points or anything like that would be helpful? Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yeah. The short answer is, it's really going great. I talked to Bill not long ago, I think, from both companies' perspectives, we are elated at the volume of both transient and group leads that are coming through our systems. The number of folks that are considering linking their MGM rewards and Marriott Bonvoy accounts, the number of groups that are unique groups that are now available to the MGM portfolio. So I think on all fronts, we are thrilled.\nDavid Katz: Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTony Capuano: Welcome.\nLeeny Oberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question.\nLeeny Oberg: Good morning.\nBrandt Montour: Good morning, Leeny. So I want to talk about group pace for '25. Have you guys seen that pace remain consistent? Has it strengthened or softened quarter-over-quarter? And have you seen any booking hesitation from large groups for '25 in relation to the election and the uncertainty around the election?\nTony Capuano: Yeah. So good questions. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the forward bookings for the balance of '24 are consistent with last quarter with about 9% improvement. In 2025, as we look ahead, right now, 2025 is pacing at 9%, which is a little erosion from last quarter. But most of the change is due to pace in room nights. Some of that is around -- or the length of time that folks are booking now, but group continues to be a standout.\nBrandt Montour: That's great, Tony. Thanks for that. And then just a second question on owned and leased. It looks like the 2Q came in nicely ahead of plan and you raised the full year -- maybe just highlight which region stood out there and then the second half outlook for owned and how that squares with your broader sort of shifting in thoughts for that portfolio? Thanks.\nLeeny Oberg: Sure. As you know, our owned lease portfolio is a bit disparate around the world, and so it can depend on certain markets. Obviously, in Europe and -- business has been good. And so those results are strong. But it also contains termination fees in that category. And I think the reality is the outlook for termination fees is a bit higher than it was a quarter ago. It's as you noted, a very modest change in the overall guidance. So we're pleased with how well the hotels are doing in that portfolio. We've got a little bit of renovation impact that goes on. But otherwise, overall, really consistent view of the results in that segment with a little bit more termination fees.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.\nDan Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nTony Capuano: Good morning.\nDan Politzer: In terms of the unit growth, certainly pacing well, and you've given a lot of color in terms of both China as well as ex-China. As we think about kind of the exit pace for this year and the setup for next year, to what degree do you have confidence in achieving that 5% to 5.5% CAGR that you laid out at your Analyst Day last year?\nLeeny Oberg: So first of all, it won't surprise you. We're not ready to talk about specifics for next year, but we certainly continue to believe that the 5% to 5.5% guidance that we gave in September of '23 is appropriate. Whether it -- we've got a specific budget that looks at a number that is higher or not. We will get there as we move through the process. The thing I'd like to point out is conversions and also the adaptive reuse numbers that Tony talked about relative to Greater China. Given that we are looking at a roughly 30% of our room openings coming from conversions and then the adaptive reuse numbers that we've talked about, I think we do continue to see a great rise of near-term openings over the next 18 months around the world. Tony pointed out the three luxury conversions that opened this year in the US, and those were in the year for the year conversions for the company. So those deals were signed this year and opened this year. So from that perspective, we do continue to feel really good about the demand for the brands. And then we talked a little bit about the uptick in construction starts, and I think you put that together and that bodes well for the company's continued net rooms growth.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Thank you. And then just, I think, Leeny, you mentioned that leisure is still growing, albeit slowly. Can you maybe unpack that a bit and talk a little bit about the underlying trends there, either by chain scale or booking window or any changes you've seen in that customer base?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, sure. You're right. We saw leisure grow 2% and while that's clearly nothing like group that was at 10%, it is still encouraging given they came out of COVID rapid fire and with huge increases in RevPAR. So very pleased. Global leisure nights were up 2%. ADR was up 1%, and even the US and Canada leisure RevPAR was up 1%. And when you look at the various segments, global luxury resorts were up 4.1% in terms of RevPAR and US luxury resorts were up almost 1%. So while I think there is at the margin a hair more caution from the US customer, we do see that there continues to be very strong demand on the leisure front. The other thing I'd point out is that we clearly are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to the lower chain scale. And you're seeing that throughout the industry as well. So when you look at premium and luxury, that overall is stronger than it is in the lower chain scales.\nTony Capuano: And, Dan, just to provide a little more context. I mean Leeny referenced the strength we've seen in leisure. Remind yourself, leisure was the fastest customer segment to recover. And over the last five years, RevPAR and the leisure segment is up 40%. And so to continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in leisure RevPAR on the shoulders of that sort of recovery for us is quite encouraging.\nDan Politzer: Got it.\nLeeny Oberg: And the last thing I'll say is we do expect for the full year, while it will not be the -- it will be relatively the slower growing segment compared to group and BT, we still do expect it to be up for the full year as well.\nDan Politzer: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Hey, good morning. If I could just start with a follow-up on that last question. Are you seeing the sluggishness at the low end creeping into higher income levels at this point?\nLeeny Oberg: No, not really. I think one thing that's just interesting is that ancillary spend around the world, US and Canada, and frankly, all of the other regions, ancillary spend was a hair softer than we anticipated. And I think it does show that the consumer in general is perhaps being a bit more judicious about the fancy dinner or going on that extra trip when they're on a vacation. And that is really the only thing. It's not trade down in any meaningful way. And as we pointed out, the resort RevPAR was sturdy. But that's really the only item that I can point to.\nTony Capuano: Yeah, I think, Bill, the empirical data that supports Leeny's observation, when you looked in the corridor at occupancy improvement by quality tier, luxury was actually the tier that had the best improvement at almost 2.5 points of occupancy year-over-year. And so, again, that high-end consumer continues to show real resilience and real appetite for travel. I think the one thing we're watching is what Leeny pointed out, and that's the ancillary spend.\nBill Crow: Yeah. Okay, thanks. If I could just follow up with a quick one about the balance of travel between inbound and outbound international. This was supposed to be the summer where it kind of equaled out and that's not happening. Can you just update us your thoughts on how you see that recovery playing out, especially inbound in the United States?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. So, interestingly, inbound is about the same as it was prior to COVID. 4% to 5% of the nights in the US are from cross-border, and it's the same as usual where big cities like New York and Miami continue to get outsized presence from cross-border travel. But they also continue to be from the markets like Canada and Mexico coming to the US. As we look at going to other markets, we are seeing that we've gone a hair higher than 19 levels. We\u2019re -- almost 20% of our business around the world is cross-border. Now, part of that, the reality is we've got more international rooms than we had in 2019. But you continue to see with the strong US dollar, you continue to see great travel from US travelers, for example, going to Japan, going to Europe, Middle Eastern travelers, traveling to many other countries. So I think the global nature of travel is only increasing, which from our perspective is fabulous.\nBill Crow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ari Klein with BMO Capital Markets.\nAri Klein: Thank you. Good morning. Going back to China, historically that region has been a sizable outsource of travel demand globally. And based on the commentary, that piece still appears to be largely holding, Why do you think that's the case and is that something you anticipate changing?\nLeeny Oberg: Could you repeat it? You broke up some on the question. Do you mind repeating it, please?\nAri Klein: Sorry about that. Yeah, so just China has been a sizable outsourcer of travel demand globally, and based on the commentary that still appears to be holding. Why do you think that that's the case? And is that something you expect to change given the broader weakness in China?\nLeeny Oberg: So I'll give you a couple of facts and also a reminder that a year ago you were just starting to see Chinese travelers leaving the country. So one of the big differences in Q2 is there was meaningfully better airlift out of China to other parts of the world. Now while the US airlift is still not back to where it was, overall there are about 75% back to where they were in terms of airlift to other countries and particularly to other countries in Asia Pacific. So, no doubt our Asia Pacific hotels outside of Greater China benefited from the higher income travelers in China wanting to go outside of China now that frankly it was a freer opportunity to do so on the heels of the recovery from COVID. So we are seeing that. I will say that the travel to and from the US is definitely not back to the levels that it was. And we do continue to expect to see really strong outbound demand from greater China. But I will point you again to the overall macroeconomic picture there in greater China, which is frankly meant that overall levels of travel spend have not recovered as fast as perhaps might have been expected.\nTony Capuano: The only thing I would add are the other catalyst we've seen is the Chinese government has been more and more aggressive in striking visa deals with preferred destinations, removing one more layer of friction for outbound Chinese travelers, especially at the high end. And we're seeing that particularly in our results across APEC.\nAri Klein: Thanks for that. And then just on the 40% increase in US construction starts, is there any notable difference between the starts on select service hotels versus full service hotels?\nLeeny Oberg: No. Overwhelmingly, our pipeline, as you might imagine, is overwhelmingly limited service in any event. And most of the full service deals that we're doing are conversions. So this is quite similar to 2019, where there are overwhelmingly select service new builds.\nAri Klein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. Just going back to the topic of unit growth, you talked about the increase in construction starts. But if you look at sort of overall under-construction as a percent of pipeline, it's still, I want to say it's at 37%, still quite a bit lower than historic. So I'm just wondering, you mentioned it's not really -- China's not the issue there. Is it a lot of projects that are sitting that haven't gotten the financing or is it actually churn and like projects falling out, new projects coming in, so that percent of under-construction isn't necessarily ticking up. Just any color around that. Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yeah, it's definitely not churn. I mean we continue to see kind of historic low levels of dropout from the pipeline. I think here in the US, while we're encouraged by that pickup of 40%, you still -- and it's a bit ironic because when you talk to the lenders, often the hospitality component of their commercial real estate portfolios are the best subset of that portfolio. But the availability of construction debt is still relatively constricted to where we were in a pre-pandemic situation. And as a result, we're not back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of shovels in the ground. Trends are going the right direction, but we're just not all the way back yet.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thank you. And just as a follow up, looking at 2025, and I know you haven't guided specifically, but you had that sort of two-year guidance that kind of implies for 2025, that conversions will kind of accelerate, I think, as a percent of new units next year. And I think conversions are already a greater contributor to your net unit growth than historic. Just looking at that 30% that you're at, maybe you can refresh this. Maybe that's, I'm not remembering that right. But if you're already at sort of that higher than historic percent, help us think about what dynamics you're expecting that will sort of drive incremental conversions of percent of total for 2025. And because there's acceleration overall in your unit growth expectation, it's not just acceleration in percent of total acceleration in absolute units as well. Thanks.\nTony Capuano: Yeah. So again, as Leeny pointed out earlier, we're not quite ready to put a stake in the ground on specific guidance for \u201825, but we continue to see conversion volume at 30-plus-percent of both signings and openings. It feels like our momentum in conversions is accelerating, and it's really encouraging to see the way the owner and franchise community is gravitating towards the strength of our revenue engines.\nRobin Farley: Thank you.\nTony Capuano: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.\nPatrick Scholes: Great. Good morning, everyone. My first question, how would you describe your visibility as far as bookings in China as opposed to the US? Even more granular, what would you say the typical booking window looks like for China versus over here? Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Yeah. So, I think our visibility is pretty good but the booking window is historically short right now. And so that's making it challenging for us to look much beyond the end of this year. Right now you are seeing very, very short-term booking window, kind of one to three days versus what we see around most of the rest of the world is closer to 20 days.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you. And then a different topic here. I'm wondering if you could give us an update on your recent trends for spending key money to make development happen. Thank you.\nTony Capuano: Of course. It's a trend that we analyze quite a bit ourselves. And so I'm going to give you a couple statistics. We're only halfway through \u201824. So I'm going to compare 2019 to 2023 full year. It's interesting, the percentage of deals in full year 2023 that required key money is actually a bit lower than what we saw in 2019. And similarly, the amount of key money offered in deals that had key money in 2023 was almost 10% lower than what we saw in 2019. Now to be sure, there's a couple other trends below the surface of those encouraging statistics. To be sure that the environment is becoming more and more competitive and we continue to apply the same lens we've always applied, which is in deals that are strategic and have a significant fee upside, that's when we consider leveraging the company's balance sheet. And number two, back in 2019, I don't know the precise statistic, but the bulk of the key money we deployed would have been in the upper upscale and luxury. And I think now you are seeing selectively the opportunity or the need to deploy key money or other capital tools lower in the quality tier framework.\nPatrick Scholes: Okay, thank you for the color.\nTony Capuano: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our final question from Michael Bellisario with Baird.\nMichael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nTony Capuano: Good Morning.\nMichael Bellisario: First question, just to follow up on the ancillary spend. Is the lower non-RevPAR fee outlook, is that being driven by lower card spending? And then are you also seeing that softer ancillary spend within the group segment, or is that comment just specific to leisure transient?\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah, no. So good questions. I would say the lower ancillary spend is across the board. So a little bit, only a little bit, but a little bit everywhere, both leisure as well as group. And then on the non-RevPAR spend, overall we are still seeing credit card spend go up very nicely. We're still looking at credit card fees being up 10% in 2024. It is the average spent that has moderated a little bit in terms of a typical card holder in the US, but again, only a very, very small amount. And just as a reminder, the ancillary spend is related to credit card spend because obviously people use their credit cards to buy these things, but our ancillary revenues are going to come through the RevPAR line because those are earned at hotels. The non-RevPAR fees are entirely a function of what's going on, obviously, in residential and timeshare and in the credit cards. And that's where, to your point, we're seeing average spend moderate a bit. But again, overall, credit card spend will go out very nicely because we're really pleased with the adding of new card holders to our portfolio.\nMichael Bellisario: Got it. Understood. And then just one follow up just on your lower end chain scales. You've noted a lot of discussions and signings, but where are you at with shovels in the ground, say, for StudioRes, and then are you still focused on the multi-unit development deals, and then when do you switch to single asset deals? Thank you.\nLeeny Oberg: Yeah. So as we spoke about before, we are really pleased with the large number of multi-unit conversion deals that we've had under discussion and in some cases closed around the world. So that is great. And then we've talked about specifically in the mid-scale as having over 300 hotels under discussion with multi-unit developers. And we are seeing more of them actually put the shovels in the ground.\nJackie McConagha: Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We have used up our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Tony for closing remarks.\nTony Capuano: Great. Well, as always, thank you again for your interest in Marriott. I hope you enjoy the balance of the summer. Hope you're out on the road, and we'll look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: This does conclude today's Marriott International Q2 2024 earnings. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Tony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and good morning everyone. We delivered another strong quarter as travel demand remained robust in most markets around the world. And our net rooms grew by 6% year-over-year. Second quarter global RevPAR rose nearly 5%. Average daily rate increased around 3% and occupancy reached 73%, up about 150 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. RevPAR rose nearly 4% in the US and Canada, benefiting from the shift of the Easter holiday. All chain scales in the US and Canada, from select service to luxury, posted positive second quarter year-over-year RevPAR. RevPAR increased over 7% internationally, led by a remarkable 13% RevPAR gain in Asia Pacific excluding China or APEC. APEC benefited from strong macro trends and increased cross-border travel, especially from Mainland China. Growth in APEC was broad-based but particularly robust in Japan where RevPAR rose 21%. RevPAR grew nearly 10% in the EMEA region with continued strong regional and cross-border demand and about 9% in the CALA region. To date in 2024, the City Express portfolio has meaningfully outperformed the overall Mexican market as well as our own internal RevPAR expectation, and Bonvoy penetration of the hotels continues to improve steadily. RevPAR in Greater China declined roughly 4% in the quarter, as macroeconomic pressures led to softer domestic demand. The region was also impacted by an increase in outbound high-end travelers. Positive RevPAR growth in Tier 1 cities, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan was more than offset by declines in all other markets, with Hainan seeing a meaningful RevPAR decline. Despite the adverse market conditions, we outperformed our peers and gained RevPAR index across the region in the second quarter. Our global RevPAR index, which is at a substantial premium, also rose again in the quarter. As we look ahead to the full year, we are narrowing our global RevPAR range to 3% to 4% growth, largely due to anticipated continued weakness in Greater China, as Leeny will discuss in more detail. On a global basis, in the second quarter, we saw RevPAR growth across all three of our customer segments, group, leisure transient, and business transient, with each segment experiencing increases in both room nights and average daily rate. Group, which comprised 24% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, remained the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year-ago quarter, group RevPAR rose 10% globally. Full-year 2024 worldwide group revenues were still pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the second quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in ADR. Business transient, which contributed 33% of global room nights in the quarter, saw a 4% increase in RevPAR. Leisure transient, which accounted for 43% of worldwide room nights in the quarter, posted a 2% rise in RevPAR. Within the business transient segment, demand from small and medium sized corporates, which now account for nearly 55% of business transient room nights, has grown significantly over the last few years. Earlier this month we announced Business Access by Marriott Bonvoy, a new comprehensive online booking travel program that we launched to ease and expand the booking experience and travel management process for these customers. While it is still early days, this new offering is already seeing great interest, and we're extremely pleased with the initial account signups and users of the platform, both of which have outpaced expectations. We continue to enhance our powerful Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, which had over 210 million members at the end of June. We continue to see real success driving enrollments and engagement internationally, in part due to our Bonvoy partnerships with Rakuten in Japan, Alibaba in China, and Rappi in CALA. Member penetration of global room nights rose again, reaching new record highs in the second quarter at 71% in the US and Canada, and 65% globally. Our new collaboration with Starbucks is the latest example of how we're connecting our members with people, places, and passions that they truly love. We also remain laser focused on providing our guests with excellent experiences in our hotels and are pleased with our intent to recommend sports which have continued to steadily rise. Our leading global portfolio continues to grow meaningfully faster than overall industry supply and we added approximately 15,500 net rooms to end the quarter with nearly 1.66 million rooms. Global signing activity has remained strong. Record signings in APEC and Greater China for the first half of the year helped grow our pipeline to over 559,000 rooms around the world. Conversions, including multi-unit opportunities, remain a significant driver of growth as owners continue to value the depth and breadth of our brand portfolio and our powerful revenue engines. In the second quarter, conversions represented 37% of openings and 32% of signings. This conversion activity has been broad based with hotels converting into 23 different Marriott brands over the last 12 months. While still below 2019 levels, we're also pleased with the continued upward trend in monthly construction starts. In the second quarter, construction starts in the US and Canada rose 40% year-over-year. In June, we signed three marquee luxury conversion deals in the US. The renowned, The Resort at Pelican Hill in Newport Beach, California, and The Luxury Collection Hotel Manhattan Midtown have already joined our system. The iconic Turtle Bay Resort in Hawaii is joining the Ritz-Carlton brand today. We are thrilled to welcome these incredible properties as we further extend our global leading position in the high value luxury segment. Our momentum in the mid-scale space is excellent. Developers are showing significant interest in our new brands in the tier. City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express by Sheraton, StudioRes, and our latest transient conversion friendly brand in the US. In CALA, we continue to sign deals for City Express and are engaged in numerous discussions across the region. Our first Four Points Express opened in Turkey and over a dozen hotels from our recent multi-unit conversion deal in APEC are expected to join our system later this year. We're also in talks for StudioRes hotels in over 300 markets and we continue to execute on and pursue numerous types of opportunities, from large development deals to one-off projects. Before I turn the call over to Leeny to discuss our financial results, I want to say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the hard work they do each and every day to advance our business and help connect people through the power of travel. Leeny? And maybe just to add a little more context to that, Shaun, the -- obviously we knew there was an election this year and baked what we've seen as historical softness. But when you look back over prior election cycles, we tended to see a little bit of group softness the week of election. Given for the unique attributes of this election cycle, we're seeing that bleed into the week after the election as well. So it's from a group perspective, about half of November is feeling the impact on the group side. It's a great question and it's sort of an interesting riddle. As you heard in my prepared remarks, we had record signings in the first half of the year in China. I think it's really about the long-term prospects in China. Our owner community, certainly the SOEs there, continue to believe in the long-term dynamics of travel, and continue to both sign and start constructing them. So we really have seen no slowdown at all on that front. In fact, it's interesting, we signed 63 select service deals in the first half of the year in China. Almost half of those are expected to open within 12 months. So as we look at the pace, we ask the same question as you. Are we stacking paper or are we signing deals that are going to materialize as openings? And the pace of construction is really encouraging. Good morning. Yeah, of course. So as I said, here in the US, up about 40%, which is really encouraging. In greater China, I might refer to the comment I made earlier. Again, in China, as you know, oftentimes projects that come to us are well under construction. So we tend to look more at what percentage of those deals might open within 12 months of signing and to see nearly half in greater China is really encouraging. In APEC, Asia Pacific excluding China, there is still some challenges getting projects financed, and there's a continued wait for a little easing in the interest rate environment. And in EMEA, you've got a similar circumstance. Financing is continuing to be a bit of an impediment. But despite everything I just described between all of the regions that we talked about, construction starts on a global basis are up that same number about 40%. And the other thing I would tell you is the combination of some improvement in construction start activity and continued really strong performance on the conversion side, we've now had 27 straight quarters with about 200,000 rooms or more under construction. So even with really strong openings, we continue to see those starts fuel the under-construction pipeline. You're welcome. Yeah, it is. And I think the short answer is, I don't think it should cause you to think materially differently about our NUG, about the value of our NUG, about our fee structures. MGM was an extraordinarily exciting and unique opportunity to bring two powerhouse sets of brands together and that caused us to be creative on the deal structure. But the vast majority, almost the entirety of the pipeline, fits squarely in our traditional approach to managed and franchise deals. Yeah. The short answer is, it's really going great. I talked to Bill not long ago, I think, from both companies' perspectives, we are elated at the volume of both transient and group leads that are coming through our systems. The number of folks that are considering linking their MGM rewards and Marriott Bonvoy accounts, the number of groups that are unique groups that are now available to the MGM portfolio. So I think on all fronts, we are thrilled. Welcome. Yeah. So good questions. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the forward bookings for the balance of '24 are consistent with last quarter with about 9% improvement. In 2025, as we look ahead, right now, 2025 is pacing at 9%, which is a little erosion from last quarter. But most of the change is due to pace in room nights. Some of that is around -- or the length of time that folks are booking now, but group continues to be a standout. Good morning. And, Dan, just to provide a little more context. I mean Leeny referenced the strength we've seen in leisure. Remind yourself, leisure was the fastest customer segment to recover. And over the last five years, RevPAR and the leisure segment is up 40%. And so to continue to see quarter-over-quarter improvement in leisure RevPAR on the shoulders of that sort of recovery for us is quite encouraging. Yeah, I think, Bill, the empirical data that supports Leeny's observation, when you looked in the corridor at occupancy improvement by quality tier, luxury was actually the tier that had the best improvement at almost 2.5 points of occupancy year-over-year. And so, again, that high-end consumer continues to show real resilience and real appetite for travel. I think the one thing we're watching is what Leeny pointed out, and that's the ancillary spend. The only thing I would add are the other catalyst we've seen is the Chinese government has been more and more aggressive in striking visa deals with preferred destinations, removing one more layer of friction for outbound Chinese travelers, especially at the high end. And we're seeing that particularly in our results across APEC. Yeah, it's definitely not churn. I mean we continue to see kind of historic low levels of dropout from the pipeline. I think here in the US, while we're encouraged by that pickup of 40%, you still -- and it's a bit ironic because when you talk to the lenders, often the hospitality component of their commercial real estate portfolios are the best subset of that portfolio. But the availability of construction debt is still relatively constricted to where we were in a pre-pandemic situation. And as a result, we're not back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of shovels in the ground. Trends are going the right direction, but we're just not all the way back yet. Yeah. So again, as Leeny pointed out earlier, we're not quite ready to put a stake in the ground on specific guidance for \u201825, but we continue to see conversion volume at 30-plus-percent of both signings and openings. It feels like our momentum in conversions is accelerating, and it's really encouraging to see the way the owner and franchise community is gravitating towards the strength of our revenue engines. You're welcome. Yeah. So, I think our visibility is pretty good but the booking window is historically short right now. And so that's making it challenging for us to look much beyond the end of this year. Right now you are seeing very, very short-term booking window, kind of one to three days versus what we see around most of the rest of the world is closer to 20 days. Of course. It's a trend that we analyze quite a bit ourselves. And so I'm going to give you a couple statistics. We're only halfway through \u201824. So I'm going to compare 2019 to 2023 full year. It's interesting, the percentage of deals in full year 2023 that required key money is actually a bit lower than what we saw in 2019.

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Second quarter gross fee revenues rose 7% year-over-year to $1.34 billion. The increase reflects stronger global RevPAR, rooms growth, and a higher non-RevPAR related franchise fees. Co-branded credit card fees rose 10%, and residential branding fees were significantly higher than in the same quarter last year, as we continue to benefit from our top position in branded residences globally. Incentive management fees, or IMFs, totaled $195 million in the second quarter. Growth in these fees was led by mid-teens percentage increases in APEC and EMEA, partially offset by an $8 million decline in Greater China. IMFs in the US and Canada were flat year-over-year, in part impacted by continued softness in Hawaii. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 9% to $1.32 billion, and adjusted EPS increased 11% to $2.50. Now, let's talk about our outlook for 2024. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 3% to 4% in the third quarter and for the full year. RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in the vast majority of our international markets than in the US and Canada. The primary change in our four-year outlook is Greater China's updated expectation of negative RevPAR growth for the rest of the year. We expect a continuation of current weak demand and pricing trends in the region, with the third quarter anticipated to see the most meaningful RevPAR decline as outbound travel accelerates during summer holidays. Note that given Greater China's lower overall average RevPAR compared to the rest of our system, it typically makes up around 7% of RevPAR-related fees, although it accounts for 10% of open rooms. While we also expect marginally lower full-year RevPAR in the US and Canada than we had previously anticipated, in part due to less group business the first two weeks of November, given the intense focus on the US presidential election, overall RevPAR trends in the US and Canada in the back half of the year are expected to remain relatively steady with the first six months of the year. On customer segment, worldwide RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues, and slower but still growing leisure revenues. In the third quarter, gross fee growth is expected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Our owned lease and other revenues net of expenses are anticipated to be roughly $75 million. For the full year, gross fees could rise 6% to 7% to $5.1 billion to $5.2 billion. Compared to last quarter's expectations, roughly two-thirds of the reductions is from IMFs, largely from Greater China and select markets in the US and Canada like Hawaii and Washington, DC. There's also additional negative currency impact from a still strong dollar, as well as well as slightly lower than previously expected non-RevPAR related franchise fees, and the timing of hotel openings. Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $345 million to $350 million. We now expect full year G&A expense could rise just 1% to 2% year-over-year. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 6% and 8% to roughly $4.95 billion to $5 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%. 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.23 and $9.40. As Tony mentioned, we're very pleased with the robust signings and openings activity across our global portfolio, demonstrating owners and franchisees continued confidence in our brand's performance. We're focused on driving strong growth and still expect full-year net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6%. Full-year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. As you'll recall, this spending includes higher than historical investment in technology associated with the multi-year transformation of our property management, reservations, and loyalty systems, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. We look forward to the many benefits expected to accrue from elevating our three major tech platforms. Our investment spending outlook also incorporates roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio, including renovation spending for the W Union Square in Manhattan and the Elegant portfolio in Barbados. When all renovations are complete, we'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts for these properties. Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value, and then returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase and a modest dividend, which has risen meaningfully over time. We continue to generate strong levels of cash, including from our loyalty program, and our leverage ratio remains at the low end of our target range of 3 times to 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. We currently expect approximately $4.3 billion of capital returns to shareholders for the full year. This factors in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago. In closing, we have a lot of momentum in our business and strong growth prospects across our over 30 brands around the world, thanks to our terrific team. As we look ahead, we're incredibly optimistic about Marriott's future. Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? Sure. Thanks, Stephen. So a couple of things in that question. One is the reality that when we typically talk about 1 point of RevPAR being $50 million to $60 million in fees, that's assuming that that's equally across all markets around the world and doesn't have any FX impact. And so I think you are clearly seeing with the drop that we talked today that the impact of the change in our outlook for Greater China has a disproportionate impact. When I think about Greater China's mix between base fees and IMFs, it's obviously quite different than it is in the US where you have an owner's priority return. So for 1 point of RevPAR in Greater China, that is typically something more like $3 [million] (ph) in fees, which is going to be more heavily weighted towards IMFs than it would be in the US where it would have a dramatically smaller impact. So I think we really have to look at the geography rather than necessarily just thinking about it as being a half point overall because it is overwhelmingly related to Greater China with just a slight, truly a tad bit lower expectation in the US and Canada. Yeah, no, we think you're absolutely right. We believe the algorithm absolutely holds up over time. You do have, as you described, the impact of certain elements changing unevenly. So in this particular situation, it is one market having a potentially large change in expected RevPAR for the rest of the year. But we've talked before about our expectation of fees per key as actually rising over time, especially as we think about also having our rapidly growing non-RevPAR fees. So we're very pleased with those continuing trends and do not believe that the fundamental algorithm is any different. Hey, Shaun. Yeah, thank you, Shaun, and you're right. We can point out that kind of an interesting distinction there between Q3 and Q4. With China only being roughly 10% of our rooms, that impact of the lowest quarter in the back half of the year being Q3 doesn't have that much of an impact on Q4. What's going on on Q4 is as we described that we are seeing a bit lower group bookings specifically in Q4 around the election, which is having an impact on the expectations for US and Canada in Q4 versus Q3, though as we described when we look at the entire back half of the year, we do expect to see really a similar sort of RevPAR growth number as you see in the first half of the year. And then on top of that, you've got your other international markets just continuing to normalize. So when I look at the first half of APEC and EMEA and CALA, I would expect that their back half is a little bit lower. And so in that regard, as you move towards Q4, you continue to see additional normalization, although still quite strong RevPAR in those markets. And you put all that together and that's where you get the bit lower outlook for RevPAR in Q4 than Q3. And the only thing I'll add is that I think with our continued strength in RevPAR index in Greater China, especially as you see demand softening over the past six months or so, we have seen increased owner appetite for being with the really strong brands that we have and across the full range of brands. So we're really pleased to see kind of from the limited service segment all the way up through luxury, the really strong demand for the brands, including conversions in China, I think really demonstrating that it's frankly in the weaker times that sometimes the brands can prove the most powerful. Yeah, sure, Smedes, and yes, I think, I think Maui is definitely still seeing the slowest recovery. You still have the reality that the dollar is very strong, and Hawaii has been always been a very popular place for Japanese travelers. And so we overall in Hawaii, we've still not seen the level of Japanese travelers back in the state. But obviously, the tragedy in Lahaina has clearly had a huge impact on the island. And while we were there with Tony, with the senior team, a couple of weeks ago, and there's been fabulous progress, and it is really coming along well. But clearly still that island in particular is having a slower recovery than the other parts of Hawaii. But Hawaii overall is still feeling the impact of the strong dollar. Sure, absolutely. So interestingly, it's the same percentage as a year ago in the second quarter. 26% of the hotels in the US are paying incentive fees in the second quarter. And just as a reference point, in China, in Greater China, we went from 86% to 80%. So you see that really large delta given the structure of the management agreements. Overall for managed contracts for Marriott, we went from 62% paying incentive fees last year in the second quarter to 61% this year. So you can see that in the US it's fairly steady and more limited to certain pockets geographically that weren't quite as strong. Good morning, Joe. Yeah, so let's do this. IMFs are definitely two-thirds of that. And I would say if you're looking at that, a solid half, if not a bit more, is from greater China. Now that you've got to get into how much is the RevPAR versus how much is FX, and there is a bit of both. Then you're also looking in IMF at some in the US, which let's call it, broadly speaking, roughly $10 million, from various markets not performing as well as we expected a quarter ago. Then you've got also FX overall is affecting both some base fees and IMFs. So to separate it out, you get into -- a bit into kind of which element are you describing. But I would say that China is the biggest impact on the change in IMFs, which is two-thirds of the overall $75 million in reduction. And then you've got a bit from the US and a bit from FX. Obviously, the lower RevPAR globally has a little bit of impact, and then ever so -- truly ever so slightly is related to non-RevPAR fees. The only thing I would add, David, is that we are really pleased with the number of multi-unit deals that we're signing. But overwhelmingly, they're multi-unit franchise or managed deals that are typical, but they just represent an owner wanting to sign a number of properties up with Marriott rather than a onesie or a twosie. So in that regard, it's great for our growth, and we're really pleased with the continuation of those relationships, but they don't represent a fundamental change in the nature of the agreement. Thank you. Good morning. Sure. As you know, our owned lease portfolio is a bit disparate around the world, and so it can depend on certain markets. Obviously, in Europe and -- business has been good. And so those results are strong. But it also contains termination fees in that category. And I think the reality is the outlook for termination fees is a bit higher than it was a quarter ago. It's as you noted, a very modest change in the overall guidance. So we're pleased with how well the hotels are doing in that portfolio. We've got a little bit of renovation impact that goes on. But otherwise, overall, really consistent view of the results in that segment with a little bit more termination fees. So first of all, it won't surprise you. We're not ready to talk about specifics for next year, but we certainly continue to believe that the 5% to 5.5% guidance that we gave in September of '23 is appropriate. Whether it -- we've got a specific budget that looks at a number that is higher or not. We will get there as we move through the process. The thing I'd like to point out is conversions and also the adaptive reuse numbers that Tony talked about relative to Greater China. Given that we are looking at a roughly 30% of our room openings coming from conversions and then the adaptive reuse numbers that we've talked about, I think we do continue to see a great rise of near-term openings over the next 18 months around the world. Tony pointed out the three luxury conversions that opened this year in the US, and those were in the year for the year conversions for the company. So those deals were signed this year and opened this year. So from that perspective, we do continue to feel really good about the demand for the brands. And then we talked a little bit about the uptick in construction starts, and I think you put that together and that bodes well for the company's continued net rooms growth. Yeah, sure. You're right. We saw leisure grow 2% and while that's clearly nothing like group that was at 10%, it is still encouraging given they came out of COVID rapid fire and with huge increases in RevPAR. So very pleased. Global leisure nights were up 2%. ADR was up 1%, and even the US and Canada leisure RevPAR was up 1%. And when you look at the various segments, global luxury resorts were up 4.1% in terms of RevPAR and US luxury resorts were up almost 1%. So while I think there is at the margin a hair more caution from the US customer, we do see that there continues to be very strong demand on the leisure front. The other thing I'd point out is that we clearly are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to the lower chain scale. And you're seeing that throughout the industry as well. So when you look at premium and luxury, that overall is stronger than it is in the lower chain scales. And the last thing I'll say is we do expect for the full year, while it will not be the -- it will be relatively the slower growing segment compared to group and BT, we still do expect it to be up for the full year as well. No, not really. I think one thing that's just interesting is that ancillary spend around the world, US and Canada, and frankly, all of the other regions, ancillary spend was a hair softer than we anticipated. And I think it does show that the consumer in general is perhaps being a bit more judicious about the fancy dinner or going on that extra trip when they're on a vacation. And that is really the only thing. It's not trade down in any meaningful way. And as we pointed out, the resort RevPAR was sturdy. But that's really the only item that I can point to. Yeah. So, interestingly, inbound is about the same as it was prior to COVID. 4% to 5% of the nights in the US are from cross-border, and it's the same as usual where big cities like New York and Miami continue to get outsized presence from cross-border travel. But they also continue to be from the markets like Canada and Mexico coming to the US. As we look at going to other markets, we are seeing that we've gone a hair higher than 19 levels. We're -- almost 20% of our business around the world is cross-border. Now, part of that, the reality is we've got more international rooms than we had in 2019. But you continue to see with the strong US dollar, you continue to see great travel from US travelers, for example, going to Japan, going to Europe, Middle Eastern travelers, traveling to many other countries. So I think the global nature of travel is only increasing, which from our perspective is fabulous. Could you repeat it? You broke up some on the question. Do you mind repeating it, please? So I'll give you a couple of facts and also a reminder that a year ago you were just starting to see Chinese travelers leaving the country. So one of the big differences in Q2 is there was meaningfully better airlift out of China to other parts of the world. Now while the US airlift is still not back to where it was, overall there are about 75% back to where they were in terms of airlift to other countries and particularly to other countries in Asia Pacific. So, no doubt our Asia Pacific hotels outside of Greater China benefited from the higher income travelers in China wanting to go outside of China now that frankly it was a freer opportunity to do so on the heels of the recovery from COVID. So we are seeing that. I will say that the travel to and from the US is definitely not back to the levels that it was. And we do continue to expect to see really strong outbound demand from greater China. But I will point you again to the overall macroeconomic picture there in greater China, which is frankly meant that overall levels of travel spend have not recovered as fast as perhaps might have been expected. No. Overwhelmingly, our pipeline, as you might imagine, is overwhelmingly limited service in any event. And most of the full service deals that we're doing are conversions. So this is quite similar to 2019, where there are overwhelmingly select service new builds. Yeah, no. So good questions. I would say the lower ancillary spend is across the board. So a little bit, only a little bit, but a little bit everywhere, both leisure as well as group. And then on the non-RevPAR spend, overall we are still seeing credit card spend go up very nicely. We're still looking at credit card fees being up 10% in 2024. It is the average spent that has moderated a little bit in terms of a typical card holder in the US, but again, only a very, very small amount. And just as a reminder, the ancillary spend is related to credit card spend because obviously people use their credit cards to buy these things, but our ancillary revenues are going to come through the RevPAR line because those are earned at hotels. The non-RevPAR fees are entirely a function of what's going on, obviously, in residential and timeshare and in the credit cards. And that's where, to your point, we're seeing average spend moderate a bit. But again, overall, credit card spend will go out very nicely because we're really pleased with the adding of new card holders to our portfolio. Yeah. So as we spoke about before, we are really pleased with the large number of multi-unit conversion deals that we've had under discussion and in some cases closed around the world. So that is great. And then we've talked about specifically in the mid-scale as having over 300 hotels under discussion with multi-unit developers. And we are seeing more of them actually put the shovels in the ground."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's call will be recorded, and I'll be standing by if you should need any assistance. \n It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Jackie McConagha, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJackie McConagha: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Marriott's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Tony Capuano, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Leeny Oberg, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Development; and Betsy Dahm, our Vice President of Investor Relations. \n Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of our comments today are not historical facts and are considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our SEC filings, which could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.  \n Unless otherwise stated, our RevPAR occupancy, average daily rate and property level revenues comments reflect system-wide constant currency results for comparable hotels, and all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Statements in our comments and the press release we issued earlier today are effective only today and will not be updated as actual events unfold. You can find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures referred to in our remarks today on our Investor Relations website. \n And now, I will turn the call over to Tony. \nAnthony Capuano: Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. 2024 is off to a solid start, as Marriott continues to deliver great experiences to travelers around the world. First quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2% with ADR increasing around 3% and occupancy reaching almost 66%, up nearly 100 basis points year-over-year.  \n While overall industry RevPAR growth is normalizing post-COVID, we continue to gain RevPAR index across our portfolio and increase our market share of global hotels. Once again, we saw RevPAR growth across all 3 of our customer segments, Group, leisure transient and business transit. \n Group, which comprised 24% of global room nights in the first quarter was again the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year ago quarter, Group RevPAR rose 6% globally. Full year 2024 worldwide Group revenues were pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the first quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in average daily rate. Leisure transient accounted for 42% of worldwide room nights in the quarter. Globally, both leisure demand and ADR growth have remained remarkably resilient, driving leisure RevPAR up 4% year-over-year.  \n Business transient, which contributed the remaining 34% of global room nights in the first quarter, had a 1% increase in RevPAR. We are making great progress on the multiyear digital and technology transformation of our 3 major systems, reservations, property management and loyalty. \n Through this transformation, we expect to unlock new revenue opportunities, further strengthen our efficient operating model, enhance Marriott Bonvoy and elevate the associate and customer digital experience. We still expect to begin rolling out our new cloud-based systems to properties next year. In the meantime, we're enhancing the digital experiences that matter most to customers, primarily how they shop and both through our channels. \n We also recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Marriott Bonvoy, which added nearly 7 million members during the quarter and had around 203 million members at the end of March. Member penetration of global room nights reached record highs in the first quarter at 70% in the U.S. and Canada and 64% globally.  \n Since its introduction, Marriott Bonvoy has evolved to become a travel and loyalty platform, encompassing a portfolio of more than 30 brands across nearly 8,900 properties and other travel offerings such as Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy and the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection. Marriott Bonvoy also spans numerous additional collaborations and member benefits, including co-brand credit cards in 11 markets and counting and access to a broad range of unique, curated experiences through Marriott Bonvoy modes, including select Taylor Swift Eras Tour concert performances. \n Looking ahead, we continue to focus on new ways to enhance the platform and connect with our members in their daily lives and across their traffic churns. We had a very busy first quarter on the development front. We added a record 46,000 net rooms, growing our distribution by 7.1% compared to the end of the first quarter last year. MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy has now launched with 16 properties in Las Vegas and other key U.S. cities now available on our system.  \n While it's still early days, we've been extremely pleased with the initial booking pace and Marriott Bonvoy room contribution, which have both outpaced expectations. While the financing environment in the U.S. and Europe is still challenging, we have strong momentum in global signings after a record 2023 and have tremendous optimism for the full year. Both Greater China and APAC had notable deal production in the first quarter.  \n Year-over-year, our open and pipeline rooms grew 6.7%, excluding the addition of our 17,000 City Express rooms. Conversions, including multiunit opportunities. Continue to be a meaningful driver of growth, representing 30% of global signings in the first quarter. Our new mid-scale brands, City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express and StudioRes are seeing significant developer interest.  \n Earlier this year, we signed our first City Express deal in the region since acquiring the brand and we are in multiple deal discussions for other properties across the CALA region. We have also now opened our first Four Points Express in Turkey and have other properties in the pipeline. We also recently signed our first mid-scale deal in the APAC, a portfolio of more than a dozen hotels that are expected to be added to our system later this year.  \n In the U.S. & Canada, we have commitments for around 140 StudioRes properties and are actively working on deals for over 100 more. Additionally in about a month, we look forward to unveiling details on our next exciting brand launch, a conversion-friendly mid-scale brand in the region. As always, I've spent much of my time this year traveling around the world. It's been a pleasure to visit many of our amazing hotels and speak with our incredible associates. I want to express my gratitude to all of our associates for their continued hard work and dedication.  \n As Leeny will now discuss further as part of her financial review, we are raising our full year 2024 earnings and capital returns guidance on the back of the strength of our diverse global portfolio, the continued resilient and steady demand for travel, our strong international performance and our continued rooms growth. Leeny? \nKathleen Oberg: Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2%. RevPAR in the U.S. & Canada, where demand has normalized, rose 1.5%. Growth in the U.S. & Canada was led by strong Group and large corporate business with our top 100 accounts seeing the most sequential improvement in 8 quarters. Leisure RevPAR was flat in the U.S. & Canada, with more customers going abroad to find warmer weather.  \n Our quarterly RevPAR results in the region was impacted by negative growth in March, due to the timing of Easter, given less business and Group travel that we booked before the holiday. The impact on the month's RevPAR was roughly negative 300 basis points. Of course, we expect a similar favorable impact in April's RevPAR. First quarter international RevPAR increased 11%. Growth was led by a remarkable 16.5% RevPAR gain in APAC, helped by strong macro trends, sustained leisure and business growth and an uptick in cross-border demand especially from Mainland China as international airlift improved.  \n RevPAR and CALA rose nearly 12% in the quarter, with excellent leisure demand coming from the U.S. RevPAR grew 10% in EMEA with strong growth across most of our largest markets. Greater China experienced a 6% increase in RevPAR while growth was strong in January and February, rising 10% for those 2 months. Demand weakened a bit after the Chinese New Year with slower macroeconomic growth and more outbound travel especially from high-income travelers.  \n First quarter total gross fee revenues were above our expectations, rising 7% year-over-year to $1.21 billion. The increase reflects higher RevPAR, rooms growth and 10% higher co-brand credit card fees. [ Global ] card acquisitions grew 18% and card spend rose 10%, driven by significant growth in our international card programs. Incentive management fees, or IMF, rose 4%, reaching $209 million in the first quarter. Significant increases in each of our international regions were offset by a decline in the U.S. & Canada, in part due to lower fees in Mali. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to nearly $1.14 billion. \n Now let's talk about our outlook for the full year. Our 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 4% to 5% in the second quarter and 3% to 5% for the full year. By customer segment, RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in Group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues and slower but still growing leisure revenues.  \n RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in our international markets than in the U.S. & Canada. While our full year global RevPAR guidance is not changing compared to our prior expectations, we now expect higher year-over-year RevPAR growth in APAC, EMEA and CALA and lower RevPAR growth in the U.S. & Canada and Greater China. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS expectations, primarily due to higher of [indiscernible] from our international regions. In the second quarter, RevPAR grow benefits from Easter timing. Fee growth is expected to be in the 7% to 8% range. \n Our owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, are anticipated to be lower than the prior year, largely as a result of a few favorable items in the year ago quarter. For the full year, gross fees could now rise 7% to 9% to $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion with non-RevPAR-related fees rising 9% to 10%, driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around $50 million to $60 million of RevPAR related fees.  \n Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $335 million to $345 million. We now expect 2024 G&A expense could rise 1% to 3% year-over-year. Recall that there are a few discrete onetime items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 7% and 9% to roughly $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%.  \n 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.31 and $9.65. We still anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6% for the full year. Additionally, we remain confident in the 3-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at last year's investor meeting of 5% to 5.5% from year-end '22 to year-end 2025. For more details on second quarter and full year metrics, please see our press release.  \n Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest but rising cash dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, factoring in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago, given our higher adjusted EBITDA expectation, capital returns to shareholders could now be between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion.  \n Full year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. As a reminder, the $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CapEx and $300 million elimination of a previously recorded guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio.  \n It includes spending for the elegant portfolio in Barbados as well as the renovations for the fabulous W Union Square in Manhattan. We'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts after renovations are complete. \n Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. \nShaun Kelley: Leeny or Tony, I'd love to dig in actually on China a little bit. I thought the comment in Leeny's prepared remarks about some of the slowdown you're seeing there was incremental. So my questions are two-fold. One, seeing that continue at all into April? If you could give us just kind of a little bit of a real-time feel. And Tony, I'm sure you've probably been over in that region. So maybe if you could help us break it down by, is this in Hong Kong, Macau? Or is this sort of more broadly across some of the cities? And then secondarily, probably as importantly, is any of this translating into what you're seeing on the development front? \nKathleen Oberg: So let me answer the latter part first because that's very easy to point out, and that has absolutely no impact on the development front. Matter of fact, as Tony pointed out, we actually had a tremendous quarter of signings in Greater China in the first quarter as well as APAC for that matter. So really excellent continued demand for our brands and from owners there. \n From Q1 was a little interesting in Greater China, Shaun, a little bit of a tail of each month. And from that standpoint, you've had a really strong domestic demand coming in January and February and with the Chinese New Year, but also reflecting the fact that last year in Q1, for example, Hainan, we're seeing stunning increase in demand, all domestic as they were coming out of COVID.  \n So when you think about it for the full quarter, Hainan actually had a decline in RevPAR year-over-year, although very strong demand. And in Hong Kong and then Macau with much more relaxed restrictions, we had almost 30% increase in RevPAR in Q1. So super strong. The Tier 1 cities were very strong. Classic Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, they did really well. It's really where we saw, interestingly in March, the new Tier 1 cities is where I think you were seeing the impact of the overall macroeconomic picture in China where it wasn't quite as strong as we might have expected.  \n But again, overall, still really strong RevPAR for Greater China at 6%. And again, for the full year, we still expect nice strong RevPAR for Greater China. But yes, a bit of a view that the macroeconomic situation there may mean that RevPAR is a little bit lower than we expected a quarter ago. \nAnthony Capuano: And Shaun, the only maybe qualitative observation I would share with you, and I'll try to underpin it with one statistic. I was there recently. I was in Shenzhen, I was in Hong Kong, I was in Macau. And while it certainly does not feel as balanced and populated with international visitors as maybe we were accustomed to pre-pandemic world, it felt better than when I was there a year ago.  \n And in fact, if you look at the first quarter, international guest represented about 15% of our room nights in Greater China. That compares to about 28% in the same quarter back in 2019. So it is improving steadily and the availability of airline seats is improving steadily. But I think over time, that represents some additional upside for us as more and more international visitors return to China. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. \nStephen Grambling: Would love to just clarify a couple of things on the guidance. On the fee increase to the guidance. Is that all IMS? Or is there any change as we think about non-RevPAR-related contributions? And then I would love to just hear some of the moving parts for the increase on the owned and lease side, too. \nKathleen Oberg: Yes, sure. Absolutely. So again, I'm going to do one of the last ones first, and that is this does not -- this increase in fees does not reflect an increase in the non-RevPAR-related fees. We still do expect really strong growth as we talked about the 9% to 10% year-over-year in those fees, but not an increase in those from our prior guidance. I would say, Stephen, it's about 75% of the increase is from IMF really overwhelmingly essentially entirely from our international markets.  \n Just to give you a sense. A year ago in the first quarter, international was 58% of our IMFs and this year in the first quarter, it was 64%.  And again, just as an example, in APAC, 90% of our managed hotels paid IMF in the first quarter and in tallow, it was almost 80%. So they both saw some really nice increases. So we clearly outperformed particularly in the IMF space. The remainder of the growth is really a reflection of non RevPAR-related growth fees.  \n For example, when you have in international and hotels, very strong food and beverage sales, et cetera, where we're also getting fees as well as the ramp-up of our fast-growing segments in Asia Pacific. When you think about a new hotel that's [ waking ] up, we're getting nice fee growth there as well. but 75% is really from the IMF and obviously, including the outperformance in Q1. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. \nJoseph Greff: Leeny, in your prepared remarks, you went through the 3 main customer segments going through your full year '24 outlook and you talked about leisure seeing slow but still positive RevPAR growth. I think that was on a worldwide global basis, what baked in for U.S. leisure RevPAR growth for the balance of the year? \nKathleen Oberg: Well, so generally speaking, we do see leisure relatively speaking, at the lower end of the growth, but still being positive. But I would put it towards the lower end. Group is going to be the home run hitter. Again, for the full year, we do see BT being up as well and continuing to progress. As you know, Joe, in Q1, obviously, BT was weaker because of the month of March. \n But when we look at it overall for the year, we do expect BT to continue to gain ground. And if I can, I'm going to go back for 1 second and answer Shaun's question on owned lease, which the increase in guidance there is overwhelmingly from a stronger performance in our international owned, leased hotel portfolio. Sorry, Joe, I'm going to hijack your question there to make sure I answer what I was asked before. \nAnthony Capuano: And I think, Joe, the further answer to your question, the differences we're seeing in leisure in the U.S. & Canada relative to global leisure are broadly reflective of demand patterns we're seeing across segments. If you look at the guidance we're giving, we're not changing our RevPAR guidance, but it's shifting a little bit. \n We're seeing a little more normalization in the U.S. & Canada but continued increases in strength in the international markets. And I think that applies specifically to your question on the leisure. \nJoseph Greff: Great. And then, Tony, I think in your prepared comments talking about the MGM licensing deal. I think you used the words, \" We're extremely pleased and outpacing expectations.\" Can you talk a little bit what that specifically means? And maybe kind of throw -- I don't know, if it's adoption measures or share of occupancy? Any kind of details would be helpful. \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. Not yet, Joe. I mean I think it's so early. We just brought them on the platform. So it's more anecdotal than anything else. My guess is, Bill, and our friends at MGM will talk about it from their perspective as well. But having done these sorts of deals over the years, both parties have expectations about how quickly we'll start to get traction on booking volumes and Bonvoy penetration. And we make some assumptions as we do those deals. And I think it's safe to say from Marriott's perspective, those expectations have been exceeded in the early days. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. \nCharles Scholes: I wonder if you can talk a little bit about how 2025 and 2026 group revenue pace is looking. Maybe break that out both by occupancy and ADR. Certainly seeing a very good group business this year, but comps do get harder going forward. And I'm curious if you could give us some color on the future years with that segment? \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. So Patrick, it's early to start talking about 2026, but I'll try to give you some visibility into a Group pace in 2025. Right now, we're tracking up about 13%, and it is driven by both gains in demand and ADR. We're up about 7% in definite rooms and up about 5% in ADR. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. \nBrandt Montour: I wanted to talk a little bit about construction activity. Your pipeline went up. It looks like nicely quarter-over-quarter. You back out MGM out of the construction pipeline. And so I guess, Tony, is there a sense that there's been any change in the developer mood with sort of latest notion that the Fed could be on hold for longer? And maybe you could talk through the lens of U.S. starts? \nAnthony Capuano: Sure. So maybe I'll go follow Leeny's trend of going in reverse order. I'll talk a little bit about the pipeline and then let Leeny provide some insights on both developer sentiment and construction starts. I agree with your observation. I think the trends on the pipeline are really encouraging. And the thing that was really encouraging to me, if you look at the pipeline and just compare Q1 '24 to Q1 '23, because it's a decent apples-to-apples comparison because neither of those would have had  MGM, were up 9% year-over-year on the pipeline. And I think that's reflective of some of the broad trends that Leeny described in her prepared remarks. \nKathleen Oberg: And when you think about the kind of the overall environment, I think you've got a couple of things going on. You've still got a constrained lending environment, certainly in the U.S. and Europe. I think at the same time though, there is more confidence in a steadier economic picture, if you will, so that we are, for example, we've seen an increase in construction starts in the U.S. at about 25% compared to a year ago. So really seeing nice pickup as people start to move forward and look at a more positive environment with perhaps not quite as much volatility. \n And again, as Tony is always quick to remind everyone, this is a long-term business where folks are used to weathering the economic cycles and recognize that if there's a great place to put a hotel with strong demand fundamentals, it's good to get it going, especially with a beautiful new product. So from that perspective, we feel really good. We added 31,000 rooms to our pipeline in the first quarter and really had strong momentum around the world in terms of developer interest across all brands. \nBrandt Montour: Well, that's super helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe not so quick. Tony, you mentioned that you guys gained RevPAR index. Is there any brands or regions or segments you would highlight where you're taking the most share? \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. So certainly, I think that the strength of our luxury footprint is an area where we continue to lengthen our [ lead ]. We're pleased with RevPAR Index and the substantial premium that we enjoy really across the portfolio. I think the one maybe caveat I would give you is that as our scale continues to grow, I don't know that RPI is as informative as it might have been a decade or 2 ago. \n Particularly in a post-Starwood world. We've got many competitive sets now where the bulk of [ asset ] is our own distribution. And so I don't know that it's as relevant, but it's certainly a metric we track, and we're certainly pleased with the continued progress that we make. \nKathleen Oberg: The only thing I'll add to it is that as we look over time, we are very pleased to see these RevPAR indices really globally and also generally in the -- within the continent at some of the strongest levels that we've seen over time. So I think it's a great sign of the power of Bonvoy and our brands to see that it's kind of consistently some of the strongest numbers that we've seen over time. \nAnthony Capuano: And when you look at the regions of the world that are outperforming, I'll use APAC as an example. One of the powerful drivers to the strength of our index in a market like that is our leading footprint. I mean when you look across some of the best-performing markets there, having the industry's largest footprint in markets like India, Japan, South Korea is helping us drive really strong RevPAR performance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. \nRichard Clarke: Maybe just to start off with, you made a couple of comments about strong outbound travel out of the U.S. and China. How well hedged do you see yourself for that? Do those consumers stay in Marriott hotels when they travel to other cities? Or if that normalizes, does that become in a tailwind for you, if domestic travel begins to pick back up again? \nAnthony Capuano: Yes, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is to point to the comments I made at the outset about the Bonvoy penetration. It is not a coincidence against the backdrop of the environment you described that we set all-time records for Bonvoy penetration, both in the U.S. and globally. And to me, the strength of the loyalty platform, combined with the breadth of our footprint in the international destinations where our guests want to travel, I think does create a tailwind for us. \nKathleen Oberg: And the only thing I'll add is kind of the interesting fact that we're really essentially back to where we were in terms of cross-border penetration. And while it may vary a bit here and there, we clearly still got lower cross-border penetration in China. And we've got, in some other areas, a bit higher. I think CALA was particularly high in Q1. In the U.S., it's very steady as she goes, where we've got basically only 5% of the customers in the U.S. are coming from outside the U.S. And that broadly speaking, our global distribution is just tremendously helpful as folks find the places they want to go within our system. But that overall, a lot of the variations really don't drive that big of a change in RevPAR. \nRichard Clarke: Okay. Great. Maybe just as a follow-up on the loyalty comment there. One of your peers has been making I guess, a bit of noise out the fact that they think they will overtake you in terms of total loyalty members. Is that a relevant metric to you? And is any of that tech investment you're doing looking to engage a higher number of customers overall? \nAnthony Capuano: Well, without a question, on the long list of loyalty metrics we look at, I think we have enthusiasm about having the industry's largest platform. But from my perspective, it goes much deeper than that. Size is important, of course. Engagement to me is a much more important facet of the program and the work that we are doing to drive that engagement through our large, powerful and growing credit card portfolio through the breadth of experiences that we offer our members, those are the powerful drivers of engagement with our members. \nKathleen Oberg: I think the penetration is, obviously, critically important as you look at making sure that you are helping your customers understand the value of the program and of all the options that they have, whether it be going to 141 countries or actually thinking about things like Ritz-Carlton Yacht and things like the Bonvoy moments that Tony talked about. So a number is a number but I think it's -- it can actually not be a true guide for the power of a program. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rhodes with Citi. \nBennett Rose: I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the trends you're seeing in the U.S. It sounds like you revised your U.S. expectations down a little bit, and it sounds like that's primarily due to the leisure component, maybe more people going abroad staying with your hotel there. And I get that your worldwide RevPAR outlook hasn't changed. But is there anything else you're seeing in the U.S. that you can share that maybe led you to expect a little bit lower coming out here nationwide for the year? Or is it all just because of what you're seeing on the leisure side? \nKathleen Oberg: Yes. No, it's absolutely solely because of what we're seeing on the leisure side. And again, we still do expect to see that it roughly will be up a little for the year, but on the leisure side. But we do view that BT and group are absolutely as strong as we expected. And leisure is still fine. But when you look at the change, which I would say kind of broadly speaking, maybe a point lower in the U.S. than we expected a quarter ago, and maybe a little bit more than one point higher internationally kind of gets us to roughly the same place from a RevPAR picture globally. \n The other thing I'll point out is as we do expect that our [ tiers ] across the segments in the U.S., we do expect that they will all be up for the year in terms of RevPAR from select service all the way up through luxury. But again, to your point, yes, it was the leisure segment. It was a bit lower. \nBennett Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your opening remarks a conversion-friendly brand. Could you just talk a little bit more about that, kind of what are you targeting there? And is that primarily, I guess, for the U.S. or? \nAnthony Capuano: Sure. No, it's global. And I think while we have a terrific track record of doing conversions across many of the brands in the portfolio, when we find ourselves in an environment like this where conversions are particularly important given some of the challenges in the debt markets. We feel like our transactors are very well armed with brands like the 3 soft brand platforms. So Luxury Collection, Autograph, Tribute. Great examples where they have a level of flexibility, not on quality, but on aesthetic that is particularly appealing to a broad cross-section of the owner and franchisee community. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. \nDaniel Politzer: Leeny, I think you mentioned that within group, the Fortune 100, you've seen the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth in quite some time. Can you maybe give a little bit additional color in how that maybe compares with the small and medium-sized business customers? And maybe remind us, which typically leads the other within the cycle? \nKathleen Oberg: So a couple of things. One reminder that small and medium-sized businesses, that is probably the hardest segment to actually pinpoint all the specifics on the travel. I think you did see in Q1, you did see relatively speaking, slightly lower percentage of small- and medium-sized BT business across the portfolio, showing up in the lower end. On the special corporate on the larger company side, we absolutely continue to see recovery of that business, as you saw, for example, finance. The finance segment is now 8% up relative to 2019. You saw a really strong continued momentum in manufacturing and communications. \n And actually, while accounting, consulting and technology are still down meaningfully compared to 2019, they also continue to see meaningful momentum into Q1. When you think about the typical trends in a cycle, I think one quarter does not a trend make. We know that the month of March had some real calendar issues. And you also know that January tends to be a little online in terms of being able to determine trends because of the timing of when Christmas and New Year's are. So I think it will take a little time. \n We aren't expecting a big difference. You may remember that we used to have pre-COVID kind of a 60-40 split between classic negotiated rate versus the small and medium, but it flipped coming out of COVID. And now, I would say we're kind of more towards the 55-45 with the small and medium still being the 55%. But yes, from a relative growth perspective, we did see that it was the special corporate end of things that really grew. \nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And just for my follow-up, I think non-RevPAR fees, they were up maybe 6% in the quarter. I think you had been talking about them being down and credit card fees in there, I think you also said were up. So within that residence and timeshare and other bucket, was there a shift around in terms of the fees there from 1Q to maybe 2Q? Or is there something else that we should be aware of? \nKathleen Oberg: Yes. I think as you're probably familiar that our residential branding fees tend to be quite lumpy. Literally can go from $10 million, one quarter down to $3 million next quarter because as units are sold, we burn those fees. They are onetime fees on the residential sales, branding fees. So if a unit sells out, we get them all at once. So that is purely timing. For the full year perspective, we don't anticipate anything different from what we thought before. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. \nWilliam Crow: I wanted to follow up on Smedes' question from earlier. And Tony, you talked about normalization in U.S. demand and certainly, we've written the same thing. But industry-wide demand has been flat to down over the past year, which really doesn't seem so much as a normalization as it does a slowdown, especially given the economic growth, which is surprise to the upside. I'm just curious at what point do we start to worry about the consumer and maybe a change in spending patterns. \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. That's a fair question. I might have a deeper concern if we were reporting to U.S. & Canada, negative RevPAR. The fact that we were up 1.5% in the quarter, even with the holiday timing impact that Leeny described gives me some comfort. And if you kind of tick through the segments, leisure was flat relative to last year's first quarter, but still meaningfully ahead of where we were back in 2019. \n In response to one of the earlier questions, I shared what I think are really encouraging statistics on the continued strength we're seeing in group. We were talking to the team yesterday that is selling -- doing advanced selling for the Gaylord Pacific project that's under construction, and they are hitting it out of the park. I mean they are seeing extraordinary volumes and demand on the Group side. \n And then even on business transient, I mean to me, when I think about 1 of Leeny's comments, the fact that the growth in the U.S. & Canada we saw a large corporate business with our top 100 accounts in the most sequential improvement we've seen in the last 8 quarters. I throw all of that in the blender and it does feel a little more like settling into a more normalized pattern versus a really systemic falling off the cliff. \nKathleen Oberg: If I can, I'm going to throw in a little bit of a glass half full relative to what I think seems like a little bit of a glass half empty question. And that is when we look at the rest of the year, we are looking both U.S. and international, like gains in both OCC and rate for the full year. We also saw that in the first quarter, you saw through luxury, premium and select, you saw that you had generally rate and OCC gains overall with the exception that in the select, you saw a slight decline in OCC.. \n But for the full year, we are expecting that we will continue to see growth. So broadly speaking, we still feel like we really benefit from these different types of travel demand. There's no doubt that we appreciate when route strengthens, when leisure quiets down a little bit, and there is overall more normalization of travel types than a couple of years ago. But when we think about the overall demand levels, we feel really good about it. \nWilliam Crow: That's really helpful. If I could just do a follow-up -- a quick follow-up here. I think there's been a lot of optimism that especially the summer, we'd see the inbound-outbound travel relationship in the United States kind of normalize and that would propel demand. And I'm just curious whether there's been a shift in that thinking at all since you moved on the margin, your RevPAR growth more in favor of international from domestic. Maybe a strong dollar is not helping things. Any thoughts you have there would be helpful. \nKathleen Oberg: I honestly couldn't quite hear the question. \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. I think the question is really just around U.S. travel versus international. I think, Bill, your comment about the continued strength of the dollar is a pretty relevant data point to consider. I was at the -- as you may or may not know, 2024 is the year of U.S.-Japan tourism. There's a big collaboration between the United States and Japan. And I met with the Japanese Ambassador on Monday of this week, and he talked about the extraordinarily strong flow of U.S. visitors to Japan and maybe innocently I asked him, how we can drive strong Japanese visitation to the U.S. And his response was, well, you can weaken the dollar against the yen. \n So I do think it's a relevant data point. It bodes well for our international distribution. And I think that is reflected in -- while our overall RevPAR guidance hasn't modified, you're seeing meaningfully more strength in the international markets for exactly that reason. \nKathleen Oberg: So the only other thing I'll add is that one of the interesting parts is that when you look at Asia Pacific's RevPAR, while some of that benefits from Tony's comment about U.S. traveler, a whole lot of that is the reality that now China is opening up more for cross-border. So you are seeing global travel preferences, not just U.S. travelers. Interestingly, our U.S. proportion of domestic travelers has been remarkably consistent over time, where -- it was, for many years, it was roughly only 5% are from outside the U.S. and that the domestic business is overwhelmingly 95% U.S. traveler, and that is still the case now. So we aren't seeing that the U.S. business is really suffering from everybody leaving the U.S. I think it is more the reality of global growth travel in general. \nOperator: Our next question will come from David Katz with Jefferies. \nDavid Katz: Tony, one of the last notes that you dropped in was about your forthcoming conversion brand and not to steal any thunder, but if we could borrow a couple of cracks of lightning. And just talk about sort of why, why now? What the sort of philosophical thought processes about sort of bringing that to market would be great. \nAnthony Capuano: Of course. I think, David, you and I have had the chance to talk in the past about our overarching growth strategy, and that strategy is really guided by this desire to make sure our portfolio offers the right product everywhere our guests want to travel for every trip purpose. \n And we learn with increasingly fluence -- increasingly frequency, excuse me, that more and more members and prospective members of Bonvoy for certain trip purposes, seek the price point and the value proposition of platforms in the mid-scale tier. The reality is, given the climate for new construction debt in the U.S. having a platform that can easily pivot between both new build and conversion opportunities, the timing seems ideal to launch something in that space. Leeny, I don't know if you want to add. \nKathleen Oberg: And the only thing I would add is that a lot of this is both market research and conversations with our owners and franchisees. So when you think about the supply that's out there, where supply is growing and where it is not, we definitely believe that there is some great opportunity for us to add more new Bonvoy members, choices for them across the spectrum. And then frankly, also need owner and franchisee demand for Marriott product that allows for conversions in markets that over time may have moved and changed, et cetera. \n So we think it's a tremendous opportunity. As you know, StudioRes, which is also a new mid-scale brand for us is overwhelmingly new build, and it's extended stay. And we just think from our conversations that there'll be great demand for us in this space as well. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. \nRobin Farley: Great. When we think about -- I think when investors think about the algorithm for sort of top line growth, it's usually unit growth plus RevPAR growth kind of getting to your top line growth. And this quarter, that would have been the other [ 4 plus 7 ] getting to 11%, but the your top line is more up in the sort of 6% to 7% range. And is there -- anything that you would say how investors should think about that going forward? I know there's sort of different types of rooms unit, unit growth. So is that sort of RevPAR plus unit growth not the way to think about top line? \nKathleen Oberg: So a couple of things. I think, first of all, the algorithm absolutely works over time. You've got to be careful about looking quarter-to-quarter or kind of really looking at specifics that are happening in a printed number versus what the trend is over time because absolutely, over time, we believe then it proves out well. \n And if you think about it this year, our rooms guidance, 5.5% to 5.9% at a midpoint of 4% on RevPAR, and we've talked about gross fee revenues having a high of roughly 9%. I mean these are -- even within the year, pretty close to that algorithm. So we do believe that the algorithm works and really just have to look at it not just one year in isolation. \nRobin Farley: Okay. And then just a follow-up question on conversions. I don't know what -- I don't know if you broke out the conversion percent outside of the MGM deal. Just sort of looking at the traditional conversions as a percent of total unit growth. I think that your guidance for next year assumes an acceleration in conversions as a percent of unit growth.\n And is this the brand that you haven't -- that you're going to launch in the mid-scale segment, you mentioned is conversion friendly. Is that, in your mind, what investors should think of as the driver for that acceleration? In conversions in '25 versus '24? Or -- and maybe there are other things that you haven't yet talked about that other brands to come or something. But just wondering if that -- if this upcoming one would be the main driver for that. \nKathleen Oberg: So just as a reminder, conversions were roughly 30% of our signings this year in the first quarter, and we've got a very strong stream of conversions moving through the pipeline. So no, while we do see tremendous opportunity there, the kind of numbers that we've talked about and talked about last September did not include, assumed expectations, would be from this new brand on conversions. We said roughly 30% of the room adds ex-MGM would be from conversions, and we continue to believe that, but that's not really a change for us over the last couple of quarters. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. \nChad Beynon: Two-parter for me on the -- or ahead of the domestic election. I recall last presidential election, there was a little bit of softness in D.C. as people were just kind of out hustling elsewhere. Does that factor into 4Q, should that be meaningful? Or is that meaningless? And then secondly, on that, -- is there anything kind of hinge on the election that you're looking at that could change the outlook in travel based on what you're seeing from the candidates? \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. Well, we better add another hour to the call to take the second part of your question, I think. Maybe the way I would answer the second part of your question, the -- on a global basis, travel and tourism thrives in relative stability. I think uncertainty around the election creates all sorts of question marks. We'll get through the election and then post results. We hope we'll settle into a little bit more stability. In terms of some of the policy issues that directly impact Marriott and travel more broadly, my sense is we will likely still end up with a bit of division in Congress. So you may not see strong moves one direction or the other. And I'm sorry, your first question was on impact of the election itself in D.C., I think. \nKathleen Oberg: Right. And generally speaking, I would say we do see that there is a dip in government travel after Labor Day and that group and business transient, obviously, is going to not be traveling during election week. But our forecast incorporates the experiences that we've seen before in presidential elections. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. \nMichael Bellisario: Question on your owned assets. When might we see some of those hotels get sold, especially international? I think [ they come about ] an improved outlook would suggest maybe the market or at least the transaction backdrop is better there. And if not, could you expand on that? And then secondarily, any CapEx plans next year for the  Sheraton in Chicago? Or should we expect a big year-over-year step down in owned CapEx? \nKathleen Oberg: Right. So I'm going to do the second one first, which is that the Sheraton Grand Chicago it actually has had a rooms redo over the past 3 years. And so with the exception of, of course, what you normally need to do, I would not expect to see big CapEx spend beyond the norm as you move into 2025 on that hotel. We will be working on a comprehensive view of that hotel or public space, for F&B, for the rooms, et cetera. \n And ideally, we'd be working with the partner so that you can really in essence, do it together so that it wouldn't be on Marriott's balance sheet, but that we would sell the hotel and then work towards what the hotel should look like with a partner. As you talk about the other owned leased assets, as is often the case with the ones that are still on our balance sheet, each one has a bit of a story. \n And so for the ones that are in Caribbean Latin America, for example, the elegant portfolio, which we are midway through a very comprehensive capital improvement program. We're thrilled with what is coming out of that and look forward to recycling that capital when it's done with a view of how we think about the AI, the all-inclusive product for those hotels. So continue to march along. \n The W Union Square, we're very close to being finished with that renovation. Again, absolutely thrilled with the product. I encourage all of you to go by and for sure, make sure you stop by the living room, which has a spectacular bar. The rooms are incredible, and we're very excited about how that represents the W brand in North America. And so yes, from that standpoint, before too long, we'll be beginning to work on the process of determining when and at what price is the right time for the sale of that asset. \n All of the rest are in that same ballpark. Clearly as there appears -- starts to appear to be a bit more of a stable view about where interest rates are going, I think we do expect that, that will help free up the transaction market a bit. I think it's a little too soon to predict the timing of it, but we are, of course, hopeful that as we get into the back half of the year, you see -- start to see a bit more clarity around exactly what the next couple of years are looking like clearly, and there's a view that interest rates are likely to stay a bit higher a bit longer. And from that perspective, stability of outlook is always very hopeful when you're looking at asset sales as well as the markets that those assets are in. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Saving the best for last. I like it. Just wanted to follow up on the SMB commentary at the lower-end chain scales. I know it's a much smaller percentage of your mix. But can we think about maybe the drivers or any industries that may stick out if we want to call it, drive to business travel? Maybe less goods transportation, maybe less disaster relief in some markets? I know it's harder to analyze these trends because in many cases, they book direct. But wonder if you had any industry commentary on the lower-end SMB trends. \nAnthony Capuano: Yes. I think it's a little hard to look at maybe individual industries. Probably the one demand source we're keeping a close eye on is government-related business, which in that tier, is quite relevant. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Tony Capuano for closing remarks. \nAnthony Capuano: Great. Well, thank you again for your participation and interest. We all hope to see you on the road soon. Safe travels. \nOperator: This does conclude the Marriott International Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your line, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anthony Capuano",
            "content": "Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. 2024 is off to a solid start, as Marriott continues to deliver great experiences to travelers around the world. First quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2% with ADR increasing around 3% and occupancy reaching almost 66%, up nearly 100 basis points year-over-year.  \n While overall industry RevPAR growth is normalizing post-COVID, we continue to gain RevPAR index across our portfolio and increase our market share of global hotels. Once again, we saw RevPAR growth across all 3 of our customer segments, Group, leisure transient and business transit. \n Group, which comprised 24% of global room nights in the first quarter was again the strongest customer segment. Compared to the year ago quarter, Group RevPAR rose 6% globally. Full year 2024 worldwide Group revenues were pacing up 9% year-over-year at the end of the first quarter, with a 5% increase in room nights and a 4% rise in average daily rate. Leisure transient accounted for 42% of worldwide room nights in the quarter. Globally, both leisure demand and ADR growth have remained remarkably resilient, driving leisure RevPAR up 4% year-over-year.  \n Business transient, which contributed the remaining 34% of global room nights in the first quarter, had a 1% increase in RevPAR. We are making great progress on the multiyear digital and technology transformation of our 3 major systems, reservations, property management and loyalty. \n Through this transformation, we expect to unlock new revenue opportunities, further strengthen our efficient operating model, enhance Marriott Bonvoy and elevate the associate and customer digital experience. We still expect to begin rolling out our new cloud-based systems to properties next year. In the meantime, we're enhancing the digital experiences that matter most to customers, primarily how they shop and both through our channels. \n We also recently celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Marriott Bonvoy, which added nearly 7 million members during the quarter and had around 203 million members at the end of March. Member penetration of global room nights reached record highs in the first quarter at 70% in the U.S. and Canada and 64% globally.  \n Since its introduction, Marriott Bonvoy has evolved to become a travel and loyalty platform, encompassing a portfolio of more than 30 brands across nearly 8,900 properties and other travel offerings such as Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy and the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection. Marriott Bonvoy also spans numerous additional collaborations and member benefits, including co-brand credit cards in 11 markets and counting and access to a broad range of unique, curated experiences through Marriott Bonvoy modes, including select Taylor Swift Eras Tour concert performances. \n Looking ahead, we continue to focus on new ways to enhance the platform and connect with our members in their daily lives and across their traffic churns. We had a very busy first quarter on the development front. We added a record 46,000 net rooms, growing our distribution by 7.1% compared to the end of the first quarter last year. MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy has now launched with 16 properties in Las Vegas and other key U.S. cities now available on our system.  \n While it's still early days, we've been extremely pleased with the initial booking pace and Marriott Bonvoy room contribution, which have both outpaced expectations. While the financing environment in the U.S. and Europe is still challenging, we have strong momentum in global signings after a record 2023 and have tremendous optimism for the full year. Both Greater China and APAC had notable deal production in the first quarter.  \n Year-over-year, our open and pipeline rooms grew 6.7%, excluding the addition of our 17,000 City Express rooms. Conversions, including multiunit opportunities. Continue to be a meaningful driver of growth, representing 30% of global signings in the first quarter. Our new mid-scale brands, City Express by Marriott, Four Points Express and StudioRes are seeing significant developer interest.  \n Earlier this year, we signed our first City Express deal in the region since acquiring the brand and we are in multiple deal discussions for other properties across the CALA region. We have also now opened our first Four Points Express in Turkey and have other properties in the pipeline. We also recently signed our first mid-scale deal in the APAC, a portfolio of more than a dozen hotels that are expected to be added to our system later this year.  \n In the U.S. & Canada, we have commitments for around 140 StudioRes properties and are actively working on deals for over 100 more. Additionally in about a month, we look forward to unveiling details on our next exciting brand launch, a conversion-friendly mid-scale brand in the region. As always, I've spent much of my time this year traveling around the world. It's been a pleasure to visit many of our amazing hotels and speak with our incredible associates. I want to express my gratitude to all of our associates for their continued hard work and dedication.  \n As Leeny will now discuss further as part of her financial review, we are raising our full year 2024 earnings and capital returns guidance on the back of the strength of our diverse global portfolio, the continued resilient and steady demand for travel, our strong international performance and our continued rooms growth. Leeny? And Shaun, the only maybe qualitative observation I would share with you, and I'll try to underpin it with one statistic. I was there recently. I was in Shenzhen, I was in Hong Kong, I was in Macau. And while it certainly does not feel as balanced and populated with international visitors as maybe we were accustomed to pre-pandemic world, it felt better than when I was there a year ago.  \n And in fact, if you look at the first quarter, international guest represented about 15% of our room nights in Greater China. That compares to about 28% in the same quarter back in 2019. So it is improving steadily and the availability of airline seats is improving steadily. But I think over time, that represents some additional upside for us as more and more international visitors return to China. And I think, Joe, the further answer to your question, the differences we're seeing in leisure in the U.S. & Canada relative to global leisure are broadly reflective of demand patterns we're seeing across segments. If you look at the guidance we're giving, we're not changing our RevPAR guidance, but it's shifting a little bit. \n We're seeing a little more normalization in the U.S. & Canada but continued increases in strength in the international markets. And I think that applies specifically to your question on the leisure. Yes. Not yet, Joe. I mean I think it's so early. We just brought them on the platform. So it's more anecdotal than anything else. My guess is, Bill, and our friends at MGM will talk about it from their perspective as well. But having done these sorts of deals over the years, both parties have expectations about how quickly we'll start to get traction on booking volumes and Bonvoy penetration. And we make some assumptions as we do those deals. And I think it's safe to say from Marriott's perspective, those expectations have been exceeded in the early days. Yes. So Patrick, it's early to start talking about 2026, but I'll try to give you some visibility into a Group pace in 2025. Right now, we're tracking up about 13%, and it is driven by both gains in demand and ADR. We're up about 7% in definite rooms and up about 5% in ADR. Sure. So maybe I'll go follow Leeny's trend of going in reverse order. I'll talk a little bit about the pipeline and then let Leeny provide some insights on both developer sentiment and construction starts. I agree with your observation. I think the trends on the pipeline are really encouraging. And the thing that was really encouraging to me, if you look at the pipeline and just compare Q1 '24 to Q1 '23, because it's a decent apples-to-apples comparison because neither of those would have had  MGM, were up 9% year-over-year on the pipeline. And I think that's reflective of some of the broad trends that Leeny described in her prepared remarks. Yes. So certainly, I think that the strength of our luxury footprint is an area where we continue to lengthen our [ lead ]. We're pleased with RevPAR Index and the substantial premium that we enjoy really across the portfolio. I think the one maybe caveat I would give you is that as our scale continues to grow, I don't know that RPI is as informative as it might have been a decade or 2 ago. \n Particularly in a post-Starwood world. We've got many competitive sets now where the bulk of [ asset ] is our own distribution. And so I don't know that it's as relevant, but it's certainly a metric we track, and we're certainly pleased with the continued progress that we make. And when you look at the regions of the world that are outperforming, I'll use APAC as an example. One of the powerful drivers to the strength of our index in a market like that is our leading footprint. I mean when you look across some of the best-performing markets there, having the industry's largest footprint in markets like India, Japan, South Korea is helping us drive really strong RevPAR performance. Yes, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is to point to the comments I made at the outset about the Bonvoy penetration. It is not a coincidence against the backdrop of the environment you described that we set all-time records for Bonvoy penetration, both in the U.S. and globally. And to me, the strength of the loyalty platform, combined with the breadth of our footprint in the international destinations where our guests want to travel, I think does create a tailwind for us. Well, without a question, on the long list of loyalty metrics we look at, I think we have enthusiasm about having the industry's largest platform. But from my perspective, it goes much deeper than that. Size is important, of course. Engagement to me is a much more important facet of the program and the work that we are doing to drive that engagement through our large, powerful and growing credit card portfolio through the breadth of experiences that we offer our members, those are the powerful drivers of engagement with our members. Sure. No, it's global. And I think while we have a terrific track record of doing conversions across many of the brands in the portfolio, when we find ourselves in an environment like this where conversions are particularly important given some of the challenges in the debt markets. We feel like our transactors are very well armed with brands like the 3 soft brand platforms. So Luxury Collection, Autograph, Tribute. Great examples where they have a level of flexibility, not on quality, but on aesthetic that is particularly appealing to a broad cross-section of the owner and franchisee community. Yes. That's a fair question. I might have a deeper concern if we were reporting to U.S. & Canada, negative RevPAR. The fact that we were up 1.5% in the quarter, even with the holiday timing impact that Leeny described gives me some comfort. And if you kind of tick through the segments, leisure was flat relative to last year's first quarter, but still meaningfully ahead of where we were back in 2019. \n In response to one of the earlier questions, I shared what I think are really encouraging statistics on the continued strength we're seeing in group. We were talking to the team yesterday that is selling -- doing advanced selling for the Gaylord Pacific project that's under construction, and they are hitting it out of the park. I mean they are seeing extraordinary volumes and demand on the Group side. \n And then even on business transient, I mean to me, when I think about 1 of Leeny's comments, the fact that the growth in the U.S. & Canada we saw a large corporate business with our top 100 accounts in the most sequential improvement we've seen in the last 8 quarters. I throw all of that in the blender and it does feel a little more like settling into a more normalized pattern versus a really systemic falling off the cliff. Yes. I think the question is really just around U.S. travel versus international. I think, Bill, your comment about the continued strength of the dollar is a pretty relevant data point to consider. I was at the -- as you may or may not know, 2024 is the year of U.S.-Japan tourism. There's a big collaboration between the United States and Japan. And I met with the Japanese Ambassador on Monday of this week, and he talked about the extraordinarily strong flow of U.S. visitors to Japan and maybe innocently I asked him, how we can drive strong Japanese visitation to the U.S. And his response was, well, you can weaken the dollar against the yen. \n So I do think it's a relevant data point. It bodes well for our international distribution. And I think that is reflected in -- while our overall RevPAR guidance hasn't modified, you're seeing meaningfully more strength in the international markets for exactly that reason. Of course. I think, David, you and I have had the chance to talk in the past about our overarching growth strategy, and that strategy is really guided by this desire to make sure our portfolio offers the right product everywhere our guests want to travel for every trip purpose. \n And we learn with increasingly fluence -- increasingly frequency, excuse me, that more and more members and prospective members of Bonvoy for certain trip purposes, seek the price point and the value proposition of platforms in the mid-scale tier. The reality is, given the climate for new construction debt in the U.S. having a platform that can easily pivot between both new build and conversion opportunities, the timing seems ideal to launch something in that space. Leeny, I don't know if you want to add. Yes. Well, we better add another hour to the call to take the second part of your question, I think. Maybe the way I would answer the second part of your question, the -- on a global basis, travel and tourism thrives in relative stability. I think uncertainty around the election creates all sorts of question marks. We'll get through the election and then post results. We hope we'll settle into a little bit more stability. In terms of some of the policy issues that directly impact Marriott and travel more broadly, my sense is we will likely still end up with a bit of division in Congress. So you may not see strong moves one direction or the other. And I'm sorry, your first question was on impact of the election itself in D.C., I think. Yes. I think it's a little hard to look at maybe individual industries. Probably the one demand source we're keeping a close eye on is government-related business, which in that tier, is quite relevant. Great. Well, thank you again for your participation and interest. We all hope to see you on the road soon. Safe travels."

            "content": "Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter global RevPAR rose 4.2%. RevPAR in the U.S. & Canada, where demand has normalized, rose 1.5%. Growth in the U.S. & Canada was led by strong Group and large corporate business with our top 100 accounts seeing the most sequential improvement in 8 quarters. Leisure RevPAR was flat in the U.S. & Canada, with more customers going abroad to find warmer weather.  \n Our quarterly RevPAR results in the region was impacted by negative growth in March, due to the timing of Easter, given less business and Group travel that we booked before the holiday. The impact on the month's RevPAR was roughly negative 300 basis points. Of course, we expect a similar favorable impact in April's RevPAR. First quarter international RevPAR increased 11%. Growth was led by a remarkable 16.5% RevPAR gain in APAC, helped by strong macro trends, sustained leisure and business growth and an uptick in cross-border demand especially from Mainland China as international airlift improved.  \n RevPAR and CALA rose nearly 12% in the quarter, with excellent leisure demand coming from the U.S. RevPAR grew 10% in EMEA with strong growth across most of our largest markets. Greater China experienced a 6% increase in RevPAR while growth was strong in January and February, rising 10% for those 2 months. Demand weakened a bit after the Chinese New Year with slower macroeconomic growth and more outbound travel especially from high-income travelers.  \n First quarter total gross fee revenues were above our expectations, rising 7% year-over-year to $1.21 billion. The increase reflects higher RevPAR, rooms growth and 10% higher co-brand credit card fees. [ Global ] card acquisitions grew 18% and card spend rose 10%, driven by significant growth in our international card programs. Incentive management fees, or IMF, rose 4%, reaching $209 million in the first quarter. Significant increases in each of our international regions were offset by a decline in the U.S. & Canada, in part due to lower fees in Mali. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to nearly $1.14 billion. \n Now let's talk about our outlook for the full year. Our 2024 outlook still assumes continued sturdy travel demand and a continuation of current macroeconomic trends. Global RevPAR is expected to grow 4% to 5% in the second quarter and 3% to 5% for the full year. By customer segment, RevPAR growth is still anticipated to be driven by another year of strong growth in Group revenue, continued improvement in business transient revenues and slower but still growing leisure revenues.  \n RevPAR growth is expected to remain higher in our international markets than in the U.S. & Canada. While our full year global RevPAR guidance is not changing compared to our prior expectations, we now expect higher year-over-year RevPAR growth in APAC, EMEA and CALA and lower RevPAR growth in the U.S. & Canada and Greater China. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS expectations, primarily due to higher of [indiscernible] from our international regions. In the second quarter, RevPAR grow benefits from Easter timing. Fee growth is expected to be in the 7% to 8% range. \n Our owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, are anticipated to be lower than the prior year, largely as a result of a few favorable items in the year ago quarter. For the full year, gross fees could now rise 7% to 9% to $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion with non-RevPAR-related fees rising 9% to 10%, driven by strong credit card and residential branding fee growth. The sensitivity of a 1% change in full year 2024 RevPAR versus 2023 could be around $50 million to $60 million of RevPAR related fees.  \n Owned, leased and other revenues, net of expenses, could now total $335 million to $345 million. We now expect 2024 G&A expense could rise 1% to 3% year-over-year. Recall that there are a few discrete onetime items from 2023 that are expected to offset wage and benefit increases. Full year adjusted EBITDA is now expected to rise between 7% and 9% to roughly $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Our 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be just above 25%.  \n 2024 adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $9.31 and $9.65. We still anticipate net rooms growth of 5.5% to 6% for the full year. Additionally, we remain confident in the 3-year net rooms compound annual growth rate we discussed at last year's investor meeting of 5% to 5.5% from year-end '22 to year-end 2025. For more details on second quarter and full year metrics, please see our press release.  \n Our capital allocation philosophy remains the same. We're committed to our investment-grade rating, investing in growth that is accretive to shareholder value and then returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of a modest but rising cash dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, factoring in the $500 million of required cash in the fourth quarter for the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago, given our higher adjusted EBITDA expectation, capital returns to shareholders could now be between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion.  \n Full year investment spending is still expected to total $1 billion to $1.2 billion. This includes another year of higher than historical investment in technology, the vast majority of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. As a reminder, the $500 million for the Sheraton Grand Chicago consists of $200 million of CapEx and $300 million elimination of a previously recorded guarantee liability. Investment spending is also expected to incorporate roughly $200 million for our owned lease portfolio.  \n It includes spending for the elegant portfolio in Barbados as well as the renovations for the fabulous W Union Square in Manhattan. We'll ultimately look to recycle these assets and sign long-term management contracts after renovations are complete. \n Tony and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator? So let me answer the latter part first because that's very easy to point out, and that has absolutely no impact on the development front. Matter of fact, as Tony pointed out, we actually had a tremendous quarter of signings in Greater China in the first quarter as well as APAC for that matter. So really excellent continued demand for our brands and from owners there. \n From Q1 was a little interesting in Greater China, Shaun, a little bit of a tail of each month. And from that standpoint, you've had a really strong domestic demand coming in January and February and with the Chinese New Year, but also reflecting the fact that last year in Q1, for example, Hainan, we're seeing stunning increase in demand, all domestic as they were coming out of COVID.  \n So when you think about it for the full quarter, Hainan actually had a decline in RevPAR year-over-year, although very strong demand. And in Hong Kong and then Macau with much more relaxed restrictions, we had almost 30% increase in RevPAR in Q1. So super strong. The Tier 1 cities were very strong. Classic Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, they did really well. It's really where we saw, interestingly in March, the new Tier 1 cities is where I think you were seeing the impact of the overall macroeconomic picture in China where it wasn't quite as strong as we might have expected.  \n But again, overall, still really strong RevPAR for Greater China at 6%. And again, for the full year, we still expect nice strong RevPAR for Greater China. But yes, a bit of a view that the macroeconomic situation there may mean that RevPAR is a little bit lower than we expected a quarter ago. Yes, sure. Absolutely. So again, I'm going to do one of the last ones first, and that is this does not -- this increase in fees does not reflect an increase in the non-RevPAR-related fees. We still do expect really strong growth as we talked about the 9% to 10% year-over-year in those fees, but not an increase in those from our prior guidance. I would say, Stephen, it's about 75% of the increase is from IMF really overwhelmingly essentially entirely from our international markets.  \n Just to give you a sense. A year ago in the first quarter, international was 58% of our IMFs and this year in the first quarter, it was 64%.  And again, just as an example, in APAC, 90% of our managed hotels paid IMF in the first quarter and in tallow, it was almost 80%. So they both saw some really nice increases. So we clearly outperformed particularly in the IMF space. The remainder of the growth is really a reflection of non RevPAR-related growth fees.  \n For example, when you have in international and hotels, very strong food and beverage sales, et cetera, where we're also getting fees as well as the ramp-up of our fast-growing segments in Asia Pacific. When you think about a new hotel that's [ waking ] up, we're getting nice fee growth there as well. but 75% is really from the IMF and obviously, including the outperformance in Q1. Well, so generally speaking, we do see leisure relatively speaking, at the lower end of the growth, but still being positive. But I would put it towards the lower end. Group is going to be the home run hitter. Again, for the full year, we do see BT being up as well and continuing to progress. As you know, Joe, in Q1, obviously, BT was weaker because of the month of March. \n But when we look at it overall for the year, we do expect BT to continue to gain ground. And if I can, I'm going to go back for 1 second and answer Shaun's question on owned lease, which the increase in guidance there is overwhelmingly from a stronger performance in our international owned, leased hotel portfolio. Sorry, Joe, I'm going to hijack your question there to make sure I answer what I was asked before. And when you think about the kind of the overall environment, I think you've got a couple of things going on. You've still got a constrained lending environment, certainly in the U.S. and Europe. I think at the same time though, there is more confidence in a steadier economic picture, if you will, so that we are, for example, we've seen an increase in construction starts in the U.S. at about 25% compared to a year ago. So really seeing nice pickup as people start to move forward and look at a more positive environment with perhaps not quite as much volatility. \n And again, as Tony is always quick to remind everyone, this is a long-term business where folks are used to weathering the economic cycles and recognize that if there's a great place to put a hotel with strong demand fundamentals, it's good to get it going, especially with a beautiful new product. So from that perspective, we feel really good. We added 31,000 rooms to our pipeline in the first quarter and really had strong momentum around the world in terms of developer interest across all brands. The only thing I'll add to it is that as we look over time, we are very pleased to see these RevPAR indices really globally and also generally in the -- within the continent at some of the strongest levels that we've seen over time. So I think it's a great sign of the power of Bonvoy and our brands to see that it's kind of consistently some of the strongest numbers that we've seen over time. And the only thing I'll add is kind of the interesting fact that we're really essentially back to where we were in terms of cross-border penetration. And while it may vary a bit here and there, we clearly still got lower cross-border penetration in China. And we've got, in some other areas, a bit higher. I think CALA was particularly high in Q1. In the U.S., it's very steady as she goes, where we've got basically only 5% of the customers in the U.S. are coming from outside the U.S. And that broadly speaking, our global distribution is just tremendously helpful as folks find the places they want to go within our system. But that overall, a lot of the variations really don't drive that big of a change in RevPAR. I think the penetration is, obviously, critically important as you look at making sure that you are helping your customers understand the value of the program and of all the options that they have, whether it be going to 141 countries or actually thinking about things like Ritz-Carlton Yacht and things like the Bonvoy moments that Tony talked about. So a number is a number but I think it's -- it can actually not be a true guide for the power of a program. Yes. No, it's absolutely solely because of what we're seeing on the leisure side. And again, we still do expect to see that it roughly will be up a little for the year, but on the leisure side. But we do view that BT and group are absolutely as strong as we expected. And leisure is still fine. But when you look at the change, which I would say kind of broadly speaking, maybe a point lower in the U.S. than we expected a quarter ago, and maybe a little bit more than one point higher internationally kind of gets us to roughly the same place from a RevPAR picture globally. \n The other thing I'll point out is as we do expect that our [ tiers ] across the segments in the U.S., we do expect that they will all be up for the year in terms of RevPAR from select service all the way up through luxury. But again, to your point, yes, it was the leisure segment. It was a bit lower. So a couple of things. One reminder that small and medium-sized businesses, that is probably the hardest segment to actually pinpoint all the specifics on the travel. I think you did see in Q1, you did see relatively speaking, slightly lower percentage of small- and medium-sized BT business across the portfolio, showing up in the lower end. On the special corporate on the larger company side, we absolutely continue to see recovery of that business, as you saw, for example, finance. The finance segment is now 8% up relative to 2019. You saw a really strong continued momentum in manufacturing and communications. \n And actually, while accounting, consulting and technology are still down meaningfully compared to 2019, they also continue to see meaningful momentum into Q1. When you think about the typical trends in a cycle, I think one quarter does not a trend make. We know that the month of March had some real calendar issues. And you also know that January tends to be a little online in terms of being able to determine trends because of the timing of when Christmas and New Year's are. So I think it will take a little time. \n We aren't expecting a big difference. You may remember that we used to have pre-COVID kind of a 60-40 split between classic negotiated rate versus the small and medium, but it flipped coming out of COVID. And now, I would say we're kind of more towards the 55-45 with the small and medium still being the 55%. But yes, from a relative growth perspective, we did see that it was the special corporate end of things that really grew. Yes. I think as you're probably familiar that our residential branding fees tend to be quite lumpy. Literally can go from $10 million, one quarter down to $3 million next quarter because as units are sold, we burn those fees. They are onetime fees on the residential sales, branding fees. So if a unit sells out, we get them all at once. So that is purely timing. For the full year perspective, we don't anticipate anything different from what we thought before. If I can, I'm going to throw in a little bit of a glass half full relative to what I think seems like a little bit of a glass half empty question. And that is when we look at the rest of the year, we are looking both U.S. and international, like gains in both OCC and rate for the full year. We also saw that in the first quarter, you saw through luxury, premium and select, you saw that you had generally rate and OCC gains overall with the exception that in the select, you saw a slight decline in OCC.. \n But for the full year, we are expecting that we will continue to see growth. So broadly speaking, we still feel like we really benefit from these different types of travel demand. There's no doubt that we appreciate when route strengthens, when leisure quiets down a little bit, and there is overall more normalization of travel types than a couple of years ago. But when we think about the overall demand levels, we feel really good about it. I honestly couldn't quite hear the question. So the only other thing I'll add is that one of the interesting parts is that when you look at Asia Pacific's RevPAR, while some of that benefits from Tony's comment about U.S. traveler, a whole lot of that is the reality that now China is opening up more for cross-border. So you are seeing global travel preferences, not just U.S. travelers. Interestingly, our U.S. proportion of domestic travelers has been remarkably consistent over time, where -- it was, for many years, it was roughly only 5% are from outside the U.S. and that the domestic business is overwhelmingly 95% U.S. traveler, and that is still the case now. So we aren't seeing that the U.S. business is really suffering from everybody leaving the U.S. I think it is more the reality of global growth travel in general. And the only thing I would add is that a lot of this is both market research and conversations with our owners and franchisees. So when you think about the supply that's out there, where supply is growing and where it is not, we definitely believe that there is some great opportunity for us to add more new Bonvoy members, choices for them across the spectrum. And then frankly, also need owner and franchisee demand for Marriott product that allows for conversions in markets that over time may have moved and changed, et cetera. \n So we think it's a tremendous opportunity. As you know, StudioRes, which is also a new mid-scale brand for us is overwhelmingly new build, and it's extended stay. And we just think from our conversations that there'll be great demand for us in this space as well. So a couple of things. I think, first of all, the algorithm absolutely works over time. You've got to be careful about looking quarter-to-quarter or kind of really looking at specifics that are happening in a printed number versus what the trend is over time because absolutely, over time, we believe then it proves out well. \n And if you think about it this year, our rooms guidance, 5.5% to 5.9% at a midpoint of 4% on RevPAR, and we've talked about gross fee revenues having a high of roughly 9%. I mean these are -- even within the year, pretty close to that algorithm. So we do believe that the algorithm works and really just have to look at it not just one year in isolation. So just as a reminder, conversions were roughly 30% of our signings this year in the first quarter, and we've got a very strong stream of conversions moving through the pipeline. So no, while we do see tremendous opportunity there, the kind of numbers that we've talked about and talked about last September did not include, assumed expectations, would be from this new brand on conversions. We said roughly 30% of the room adds ex-MGM would be from conversions, and we continue to believe that, but that's not really a change for us over the last couple of quarters. Right. And generally speaking, I would say we do see that there is a dip in government travel after Labor Day and that group and business transient, obviously, is going to not be traveling during election week. But our forecast incorporates the experiences that we've seen before in presidential elections. Right. So I'm going to do the second one first, which is that the Sheraton Grand Chicago it actually has had a rooms redo over the past 3 years. And so with the exception of, of course, what you normally need to do, I would not expect to see big CapEx spend beyond the norm as you move into 2025 on that hotel. We will be working on a comprehensive view of that hotel or public space, for F&B, for the rooms, et cetera. \n And ideally, we'd be working with the partner so that you can really in essence, do it together so that it wouldn't be on Marriott's balance sheet, but that we would sell the hotel and then work towards what the hotel should look like with a partner. As you talk about the other owned leased assets, as is often the case with the ones that are still on our balance sheet, each one has a bit of a story. \n And so for the ones that are in Caribbean Latin America, for example, the elegant portfolio, which we are midway through a very comprehensive capital improvement program. We're thrilled with what is coming out of that and look forward to recycling that capital when it's done with a view of how we think about the AI, the all-inclusive product for those hotels. So continue to march along. \n The W Union Square, we're very close to being finished with that renovation. Again, absolutely thrilled with the product. I encourage all of you to go by and for sure, make sure you stop by the living room, which has a spectacular bar. The rooms are incredible, and we're very excited about how that represents the W brand in North America. And so yes, from that standpoint, before too long, we'll be beginning to work on the process of determining when and at what price is the right time for the sale of that asset. \n All of the rest are in that same ballpark. Clearly as there appears -- starts to appear to be a bit more of a stable view about where interest rates are going, I think we do expect that, that will help free up the transaction market a bit. I think it's a little too soon to predict the timing of it, but we are, of course, hopeful that as we get into the back half of the year, you see -- start to see a bit more clarity around exactly what the next couple of years are looking like clearly, and there's a view that interest rates are likely to stay a bit higher a bit longer. And from that perspective, stability of outlook is always very hopeful when you're looking at asset sales as well as the markets that those assets are in."
