After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Ms. Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. Please go ahead.\nKatie Royce: Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today\u2019s call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon everybody. Today, I'd like to address three topics with you; namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy, and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This included a negative 120 basis point impact from the exit of content moderation services and a negative 250 basis points impact related to the anticipated exit from a large financial services engagement. This relates to a complex ambitious project that was scoped in late 2018. Over time, both parties realized that the transformation aspect of the project as initially conceived was unlikely to achieve our shared expectations. I'm confident that it is in everyone's interest to manage to an exit. Jan will provide more details on the financial implications of this exit in his remarks. However, I want to underscore that I'm confident in both our client portfolio and our deal review and solutioning processes, many aspects of which we've overhauled in the last year. Excluding the impact from the anticipated exits from this engagement, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations and our guidance. Gross margins increased, cash flow is strong, and we continue to invest significantly to fuel our growth priorities. We maintained our momentum in the quarter with full year 2020 bookings growth in the mid-teens. With over one year of data, assumption tweaks and refinements behind us, our analytics have been improved on going to bookings, bookings growth, including renewals and new business, and bookings to revenue. We entered 2021 with growing confidence in our strategic, operational and commercial progress and a strengthening demand environment.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. I'm delighted to be with you on my second earnings call and to be reporting another good quarter, excluding the one-time impact I'll discuss more later. The business performed well, modestly exceeding our expectations during the quarter, driven by solid performance across the board, excluding financial services, and the industry's most directly impacted by COVID, notably retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. For the full year, revenue was $16.7 billion, representing a decline of 0.8% compared to 2019 and a decline of 0.7% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year, this includes a negative 110 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, a negative 70 basis point impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment and a positive approximately 210 basis points of contribution from our acquired businesses. For the full year, digital grew over 13%, it represented approximately 42% of total revenue, an increase of five points as a percentage of total revenue from 2019. Our Q4 revenue was $4.2 billion, representing a decline of 2.3% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes a negative 250 basis points impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services and a positive 270 basis points of contribution from our acquisitions. Before moving on, I will provide some additional details relating to the anticipated exit from the previously mentioned large engagement. In discussions, the parties agreed that a clean separation would be to our mutual benefit. As a result of those discussions, in the fourth quarter, we made an offer that includes among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, we recorded a $140 million charge in the fourth quarter, which included a reduction to Q4 revenue of $107 million and additional expenses of $33 million, which impacted SG&A primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. The charge exclusively impacts our Financial Services segment. We are in active discussions and hope to have a finalized agreement in the near future. Now, moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 11.4% and including a negative 730 basis points impact from the anticipated contract exit. Excluding this impact, banking and insurance both declined mid-single digits, in banking, growth in regional and retail banking in North America was more than offset by weakness in cards and payments clients. Insurance also performed below our expectations, driven primarily by weakness in North America. Health care grew 3.3%, which included similar performance in both in the US payer business and life sciences. Life sciences revenue was strong among our pharmaceutical clients, further enhanced by the expansion of our portfolio of services as a result of our acquisitions of Zenith Technologies. Growth was partially offset by the continued weakness in medical device clients, which have been impacted by reduced elective procedures volumes. Our Healthcare payer business had the best performance in seven quarters, with strength in software license sales from the addition of several new logos. Products and Resources declined 2.4% as low double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities was offset by double-digit declines in the travel and hospitality industry, and a high single-digit decline in retail and consumer goods, while still challenged on a year-over-year basis, we have witnessed some stabilization in the last two quarters, particularly within retail and consumer goods, which grew modestly on a sequential basis. Communications, media and technology grew 3.4%, which included a negative 790 basis points impact from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we remain very pleased with the business momentum within technology. Communications and media growth accelerated sequentially and grew low double-digit growth year-over-year, helped in part by several of our acquisitions. Now, moving on to margins. In 0Q4, our GAAP operating margin was 11.1% and adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 12.3%. Both our GAAP and adjusted operating margin included a negative 300 basis points impact related to the anticipated contract exit, which includes an approximately 160 basis points impact to gross margin. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.59, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, which both included a negative $0.25 per share impact from the anticipated contract exit. Our adjusted tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter, reflecting the change -- the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, which generated losses that are not tax deductible. Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, high incentive compensation, annual merit increases and investments in organic and inorganic revenue growth. Savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E and favorable movement in the rupee partially offset this pressure. During the quarter, we completed our Fit for Growth program, achieving $530 million in gross annualized savings through continued cost discipline, which has allowed us to accelerate our growth investments. The majority of savings achieved under this program benefits our gross margin, while the accelerated pace of investments is primarily being captured in SG&A. These investments include an accelerated pace of acquisitions which we believe are key to our business transformation, additional sales hiring, repositioning the Cognizant brand and hiring more senior talent in international markets to drive growth. We manage the business at the operating margin level and therefore, believe it is a better metric to judge the profitability of the business. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or $2 billion net of debt. As a reminder, at the end of October, we fully repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion. Cash flow in Q4 was again strong, with free cash flow of $809 million. This brought our full year free cash flow to $2.9 billion. DSO ended the year at 70 days, representing a year-over-year improvement of 3 days. In '21, we expect to see our free cash flow decline from 2020 levels as a result of several benefits we experienced this year, which will not repeat in 2021. These include government offered deferrals of certain tax payments and a lower cash payment related to our 2019 annual incentive compensation, which was paid in Q1 2020. Our outlook for '21 assumes free cash flow conversion will return to more normalized levels around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved this year. We opportunistically utilized our strong free cash flow in 2020 and continue to achieve capital deployment strategy, utilizing over 110% of annual free cash flow. In 2020, we spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions, representing approximately 40% of our full year free cash flow. We returned approximately 70% of our free $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on India earnings. This decision allows us to more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, giving us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. Over the next several years, we plan to deploy 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. We intend to allocate 50% of free cash flow towards M&A in areas aligned with our strategic priorities. The remaining 50% will be allocated to dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% and repurchases to offset dilution annually. While these are a set of guiding principles, we will continue to be opportunistic in our allocation of capital, as well as leverage our strong balance sheet. In support of this strategy, during the fourth quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, and today we are announcing a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. The second consecutive year of increase since initiated the dividend in 2017. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.34 billion to $4.38 billion, representing 2.8% to 3.8% growth, or 1% to 2% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 180 basis points impact. This outlook assumes an improving yet still cautious start to the year with continued macro uncertainty. We expect stabilization in financial services and continued pressure across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communications and media, Q1 also still includes an approximately 85 basis points of headwind from the exit of certain content services. For the full year, we expect revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% growth, or 4% to 7% in constant currency, based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 150 basis points impact. This outlook includes approximately 300 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue and assumes improving revenue momentum from Q1 levels. Our full year outlook assumes an approximately 30 basis point headwind from the exit of content services. To put the full year guidance and better perspective, there are several factors impacting the quarterly guidance to highlight. First, keep in mind, our Q2 2020 actuals included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which will lead to easier year-over-year comparison Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook. Second, the charge recognized in Q4 related to the anticipated exit from the customer engagement will create challenging year-over-year compares through Q3 and then an easy compare in Q4. However, this does not impact full year revenue comparisons. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. We expect margins in Q1 to be at the low end of that range and to operate within the range each quarterly period for the full year. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million versus $119 million in 2020. As a result, of the $1.2 billion cash repatriation in the fourth quarter, which moved cash from India to other jurisdictions with lower yields. Our outlook soon average shares outstanding of approximately $530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. With that, we will open the call for questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session  Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted a number of areas of progress in the Cognizant transformation, both strategic and operational. Just can you take a step back here now almost two years in, how would you characterize where you are in the transformation journey at Cognizant, kind of still in the beginning, middle innings near the end? And what aspects would you say are mostly completed versus what are the big steps still remaining? Thank you. \nBrian Humphries: Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks for the question. I'd say we're in the middle. And I think we still have a few years of work ahead of us, but we've made huge progress, and I'm very proud of the team and grateful for everything that they've helped us to do. If you go back two years ago, we talked about a transformation office that started with our strategic direction and refinements, which naturally led to refinements of our company portfolio, both exiting non-strategic elements. Such as content moderation as well as strengthening our digital capabilities with an intensive targeted set of M&A transactions. We're now much more in the strategic execution mode and there are four elements to that. Core to this is globalizing and repositioning the brand. You've seen some recent announcements. We'll have more to go through in the coming weeks and months. That will actually help us with our second goal, that of globalizing Cognizant, which involves really getting after underpenetrated markets internationally, which today still represent approximately a quarter of our revenue as well as giving clients around the world, greater assurance that we have a robust and resilient delivery network. The third goal will be around accelerating digital, and we made good progress there, and we will continue to invest behind this strategic goal and I should point out that clients are very pleased that we are actually showing up with a broader portfolio, giving them optionality and alternatives. And then the fourth point that you'll see us continue to invest in as part of our transformation is increasing our relevance to clients. That has involved us changing out some of our commercial teams, refreshing them bringing in people with much deeper industry knowledge, and indeed, sub industry knowledge and making sure we have client-facing teams who can interface across the entire C-suite of Global 2000 companies. So, we've accomplished a great deal. Some would say against the odds, particularly given COVID and ransomware in the last year. But the team are energized, we're in this together, and we're all committed to do something incredible in the coming years. But that's why, to be very honest, we've also left room in our financial plan in the coming years to continue to invest behind the transformation because we're not done yet.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask around bookings performance. Any color you can give as it relates to the overall company and digital bookings in 4Q? And then as you think about your growth here over the last, let's say, two quarters or so, can you give us a sense of whether that's been from stronger competitive wins and better positioning of Cognizant due to the investments you've been making versus just the rising tide in the recovery of overall demand and spend? Just curious if you can give us a sense of how you see the mix of contributing factors to your booking performance here?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. I'll jump in and kick us off on the bookings side, because I think I mentioned in my last call, I had to do some formal training to dive in and deeper understand our bookings number. And I did so. Our full year bookings growth for this year was in the mid-teens. But as I learned, of course, bookings numbers -- we offer this bookings number for illustrative purposes to convey basically, the distribution momentum and self momentum and success we have with our clients, and you should see it as that. Brian mentioned in his in his notes that we continually improve review and understanding of this bookings number, and we made good progress in the fourth quarter. So I'm delighted that, the momentum continues basically in the mid-teens. We did make some adjustments to our bookings number as we shifted a little bit the bookings between the quarters. But the full year number is similar to what we've reported in the third quarter 15 -- round the mid-teens. And then, Brian, do you want to give some more detail on digital bookings and distribution up bookings?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. So look, I think, first of all, it's fair to say, I believe we are more competitive than we have been. I believe we're more client-facing than we have been in recent years. That starts with a tone from the top, but we've also added significant coverage in the course of the last year. In some regards, that's positive, but it should be more positive on a go-forward basis as well because these people that we brought into the company will ultimately become more productive as time goes on. And some of the goodness from that, which will ramp over time, will also be complemented by the fact we've had some disruption this year, because we've been upgrading our client-facing teams. Because we wanted to have a set of client-facing teams who are better capable of conversing across the entire C-suite. So I think we're stronger. We're more energized. We're more client centric. Frankly, we also have a stronger portfolio. We have been aggressive in our M&A stance in the past year. We got a lot of momentum behind the assets we've acquired, and that puts us in a position where we can show up well beyond the CIO, CTO organization and now engage much more broadly at the C-suite. Similarly, I think it is fair to say that the -- there is growing optimism in the market. If I think about client behavior, clients are certainly making investment decisions. It's somewhat of an uncertain background because of where we are with vaccine rollout spread to world. But clients are being decisive. And in decision is the enemy of CEOs of Services Company. So I'm happy to see them making decisions. What are they putting their money behind? Ultimately, growth acceleration, efficiency, agility, scalability, business continuity, of course, this leads to investment decisions, if you will, around Customer 360, customer experience, cloud acceleration, automation, hyper personalization, of course, which brings you with the core and data modernization, AI analytics and machine learning. So this is all happening in a period where we're working in a different manner. And clients have gotten used to working via distributed agile, which I think will fuel different ways of working going forward. I believe it's also giving rise to questions around who strategic partners are, which is why we're really committed to continuing to invest behind industry thought leadership, industry solutions, partnerships, technology consulting and vendor consolidation is real, and I'm delighted to say Cognizant can truly play across build, operate and indeed into transformation innovation with our extended brand. So I feel very good about our position. The market is getting stronger. If anything, right now, what we have is a disconnect between demand supply economics. And I'm worried about skill shortages across the industry.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi thank you very much. Good afternoon, good evening. I wanted to ask about guidance, and thank you for the information, 4% to 7% includes 3 points of M&A. But I wanted to get some additional clarifications surrounding the events of Q4. And how should we be thinking about financial services within the context of that 4% to 7% constant currency growth? Given that, I assume this is an ongoing headwind associated with, as you said, the first couple of quarters. But could you give us a little parameters on how we should be thinking about financial services in particular? And then the second part, is there any incremental impact that we should be contemplating to the adjusted operating margin, 15.2% to 16.2%, is there any additional charges related to the -- what happened in Q4 with the financial services organization? Thank you.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. This -- I can add a little bit more color around the exit from this financial services engagement. It's really contained in the fourth quarter. So we put the charge in revenues and -- on the bottom line. And what we -- and that impact on financial services in the fourth quarter had a growth impact of 7 -- a little bit more than 7%, I think I said.\nKeith Bachman: Yes.\nJan Siegmund: And with that, financial services performance continue to be declining in the fourth quarter and has been a weak spot in our performance. So I anticipate that we're -- as Brian and I indicated that we're going to be stabilizing financial services performance throughout the fiscal year and end up in a stabilized way for Financial Services.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. And the margins, is there incremental -- any incremental charges associated with that? Or is that all taken in Q4?\nJan Siegmund: They\u2019re all taken in Q4. There should be no more impact in '21.\nKeith Bachman: Okay.\nBrian Humphries: Keith, it's Brian here. That's behind us. Maybe just a little bit of flavor for quarters where Jan wasn't here last year. Q1, as you know, is a tougher compare than the rest of the year because COVID really started being talked more about in the mainstream media and beyond in the month of March. So the last month of Q1 so the compare and financial services and as we think about the shape of the year, we'll still be, let's say, more challenging there as the turnaround efforts continue to take hold against a tougher backdrop. Q2 should be an easier compare for us. And frankly, the easiest compare for us in FSI should be in Q4, given, as Jan said, we've taken financial entries this quarter related to the anticipated exit of this contract. But I'm fully aligned to Jan's point of view, we'd expect a gradual recovery in 2021 with the quarterly I've just given you against the quarters within that.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. All right. Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. You may proceed with your question.\nRod Bourgeois: Hey guys. Hey, I just want to ask about the growth versus margin topic as you look forward? Specifically in 2021, does your margin guidance leave you with enough room to invest in building digital capabilities and driving share gains. And then I think even looking beyond 2021, it'd be great to get a sense, do you feel like your growth investments would taper after this year as you make further progress in the turnaround? Or would your growth investments be prone to continue at a similar clip as you look beyond maybe this year? If you can give us some outlook there on the growth versus margin trajectory.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Maybe I'll jump in with setting the framework. Our guidance includes the impact of acquisitions that we have announced and closed as of today, and is anticipated. These acquisitions will create margin pressure for us in 2021, approximately 100 basis points or so, roughly. And that is built into as well as our continued investment of building out our organic growth capabilities, our investments into marketing, et cetera. So the guidance includes the substantive continuation of our strategic initiatives into 2021. That was very important for Brian and me as we devised our budget process that we continue committed to executing that strategy, which is a multi-year strategy. Future acquisitions, as I indicated, we're planning to continue on our M&A strategy, where I illustrated our capital allocation outlook and plan. So if we were to spend another $1 billion on acquisitions. That would be incremental margin pressure that is now built could be incremental margin pressure. That's not built into our guidance as always will be incremental. But I think the plan as it is provides full support of the strategic direction that Brian illustrated earlier.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Maybe if I could just embellish those comments that we made. Hello, Rod. First of all, yes, we feel good about our guidance for 2021. It sees us accelerate revenue, show margin expansion, whilst ultimately investing materially into the future. But I always want to be crystal clear on these calls that our goal is to drive shareholder value creation by positioning Cognizant for medium and long-term success and sustained earnings growth, and I think the best way for us to get about doing that is to get after the revenue opportunities. Look, we're in the middle of a -- what we're calling a multi-year project to reposition the company. I\u2019m genuinely pleased with how the team has come together. We're united. We're ambitious. We're eager to prove our potential. In 2020, I asked the team to pull together to operationalize the transformation agenda. That included strategic, organizational, cultural and indeed financial elements, and some of it was uncomfortable for certain segments of the employee base. But we executed an aggressive M&A strategy to complement our portfolio. We executed a restructuring program. The savings of which allowed us to start reinvesting in the business, including hiring those commercial resources we referenced earlier. And with bookings now up in the mid-teens, the P&L can start to work again. And that was the secret sauce of Cognizant over the years. It was always a growth company fueling investments in our clients with delivery excellence, which afforded us to continue to drive that on a sustainable basis. That's the direction we're taking the company forward. We've got so much more work to do, but I think so much more optimism about the future. And I definitely feel a lot better about our position, because a lot of the heavy lifting of the initial portion of the transformation is behind us. We'll continue to invest in delivery excellence, commercial coverage, our talent, our systems and tools, which were not in my mind fit-for-purpose for a Fortune 200 company. That's why we announced today our intent to go forward with Workday and HCM. You know we're investing heavily between IT and security remediation and modernization. We'll continue to invest in our portfolio and in our brand, and we're feeling pretty comfortable in terms of where we are.\nRod Bourgeois: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. So, I guess the question for me is with regards to the underlying sort of economic and operating assumptions for the lower and upper part of both the revenue and margin outlook? And given the confidence implied in post 1Q acceleration. I guess the follow-on to that is the supply side question because when I look at high utilization and sequentially higher attrition, can you provide some comfort on the ability to meet delivery objectives of that implied acceleration of demand?\nBrian Humphries: So, let me start a little bit with some order questions, Jan, feel free to jump in at any moment here as well. So, first of all, with regards to the delivery organization of where we stand on that, look, we have a demand/supply imbalance, if you will. The market has snapped back aggressively, as evidenced in our strong bookings momentum. I would say that the competition for digital talent is extremely competitive. All major digital domain skills are in high demand across cloud, digital engineering, data, AI and we are, therefore, very much focused on recruitment and attrition. For those of you who track media, you'll see us be much more aggressive in terms of social platforms for hiring. We're doing a luck with our employee base around making sure they see the potential of the company, making sure they understand the growth ambitions of the company, their career opportunities. And so we look forward to trying to optimize that as best we can. But you guys know as much as we do that in a high demand environment, where you have an imbalance, it can lead to certain outcomes. Now, we've got to understand what that means in terms of pricing environment as well to be very, very clear. With regards to utilization, there's a few things happening simultaneously from my perspective. First of all, clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, and that has been somewhat forced upon them in 2020. But actually, I think it's worked well. And now many clients are looking at real estate consolidation policies and understanding that we can work for them nearshore, onshore or indeed, offshore. The higher the offshore mix can actually help margin rate, but it's not necessarily helpful to margin dollars or indeed revenue dollars. So, we're seeing a trend certainly towards offshore leverage which is pushing the short-term offshore utilization higher as we consume the bench. But I don't know that that's likely to be sustained over the longer term because we plan to increase our hiring, rebuild our benches, and though we are, as I said earlier, in a high demand environment at this moment in time. We're also doing some tactical things internally. We've recently moved our India-based workforce onto a nine-hour Workday, which is in line, I should add, with industry practice which will result in a reduction of utilization in India, in theory, in the next quarter or so by one to two points. But we'll continue to look at utilization and track it and understand how these dynamics play in.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thanks so much. I know you've covered a lot already, but I want to ask about the customer engagement again and what makes this unique hear in terms of what happened and why the exit occurred? I'm just trying to get a better sense of if this was one off? Or are there some other accounts that you're tracking as well?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Let me get off. And then Jan, if you've any of the financial elements, please embellished this as well. So first of all, we have a delivery excellent organization. That insurers were aligned to a, a sophisticated set of delivery methods for want of a better words, you could think about these as methodologies, principles, programs, tools. As a Global Fortune 200 company, at any time, we probably have between 20,000 and 25,000 projects or programs underway in our delivery organization. And these projects are constantly reviewed and mapped. It goes without saying. For Cognizant then I bet every other services company out there in the world that at any one-time for a company of our size, there are certain projects that are classified amber, some red. These projects are monitored constantly actions and frankly, senior management right up to me get involved in client discussions as needed. I will say we're on top of this. I've reviewed our entire portfolio over the last few years. I know where we stand. We have enhanced rigor in our dealer review and solutioning processes. Many of those aspects, by the way, have been changed in the past year. And just as a reminder, we have a new CFO, who's pretty hands on. We have a new global delivery leader who came into last year, who's We've been new Chief Admin Officer who's charged, amongst other things, with contract management and pricing. Each of these executives bring their own experience and value on complex deal pursuits, steel solution and pricing, which puts me in a position where I feel confidence where we stand.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Trust rigorous there. Then I think \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nMatt O'Neill: Hey. Hi, gentlemen. Good evening. Thanks for talking my question, a lot of good questions asked and answered already. I was hoping I could ask a little bit more around the sort of hiring dynamics, and as well as the kind of international dynamics as well as far as, Brian, you mentioned hiring a lot of MDs internationally. And what is the kind of sort of expected ramp or lag from kind of higher to accelerating the actual business in some of the international markets as well as going back to the broader discussion on hiring as far as the -- the relative scarcity of talent and challenges there as far as finding the right people with the right skill sets? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Look, from the international perspective, we called it global growth markets, which is about 25% of our business. We were quite intentional in the last year that as we're globalizing the company, so too, that we want to localize the company to a certain extent. So that means, as an example, we've recently changed that our Head of Japan. We've hired a Japanese local previously was the Head of Microsoft Japan, prior experience in Oracle, HP, IBM Japan. So somebody with followership amongst clients, somebody would followership with talent and a roster of C-suite networks in the country. That's important to me, but we also need the people who can fit in with Cognizant culture are extremely energetic and really want to do something incredible in the years ahead. I've got to say, it's been an absolute pleasure. We've been able to attract incredible talent to Cognizant across upgrades we've made in the U.K., Ireland, in the Nordics, in Germany, in Australia, New Zealand, in Japan and indeed the new Head of Global Growth Markets, Ursula, who joined us in the month of December as well. And I'm very optimistic that they will ramp rapidly because there are a Class A type personalities, very senior, quick studies. We've helped them already with multiyear business plans to see how we can drive exponential growth in these geographies. Of course, I want to give them time to settle in, but they know that they've been hired with great expectations. And of course, they're charged not just with delivering commercially and from a delivery point of view locally and spending for the principles of the company, but also we are pivoting, transforming the company, the classic, very heavy leverage of application outsourcing, labor arbitrage, India model is being complemented, of course, with much more local selling, solutioning and delivery as we're driving across the entire C-suite to sell projects. So I'm very optimistic. I'm very excited about the potential we have overseas. And I think it's an area that we haven't adequately mined internationally, and it's an area that, frankly should enable us to drive nice growth. The broader talent question ultimately goes back to the market dynamics, which are stronger. If you look at the industry analysts these days, many of them are thinking about growth rate in the 3% to 6% for the entire industry going forward. Digital skills are particularly in demand. And that's something I think the entire industry is facing into. We can control what we will. So we are 100% focused as the management team around recruitment and around attrition and making sure we can fulfill against our bookings momentum. In the same vein, I'm proud to say we promoted tens of thousands of associates recently and rewarded the majority of our employees with a merit-based salary increase and indeed, this year we accrued and we will pay bonuses at higher levels than last year, notwithstanding COVID-19 and a ransomware attack. So we have a more rigorous approach to talent. You will see that process continue. We will probably be faced with still sequential pressure in involuntary attrition simply because we're going through end of year cycles. And after bonuses are paid, we'll see what happens. But we're 100% focused on attrition and recruiting and a 100% focused on ensuring that our employee value proposition and employee brand is world-class.\nMatt O'Neill: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.\nMaggie Nolan: Thank you. Brian, you spoke positively about the building strength of the portfolio and your positioning in-light of substantial M&A activity. Can you comment on the competitive environment in the digital engineering space? Do you hope to take up market share with new or existing clients? And do you have to disrupt competitors to do this?\nBrian Humphries: This is one of the hidden jewels, Maggie, in the entire corporation. Obviously, we have a rich heritage in application development and application maintenance, but that gives us a tremendous opportunity then to move much more forward, leveraging the strong skill-sets and the talent that we acquired with Softvision back in 2018. In fact, we've done 2 digital engineering acquisitions in the last probably 4 months, Tin Roof in the United States, as well as Magenic and that most recently as well in this week that we closed. And you'll see us continue to complement those across the globe. We already have a very strong footprint across North America, and you'll see us continue to embellish Western Europe with that skill set as well. Of course, we think we're entering a new phase of digital, and this brings with it different dynamics. Clients aren't thinking of digital necessarily anymore simply as the classic tech stack at the bottom where they think about applications or infrastructure or data. Our vision is ultimately that clients will recognize its power of digital is unlocked not in those silos investments, but more across business processes and operating models. And that ultimately involves selling value, delivering value. It involves intelligence in consumer-grade applications from a CX point of view with security grade features, ultimately driven by intelligence that's fueled by massive data modern architecture sitting on cloud platforms. And our digital engineering play truly bitter interactive and experienced capabilities makes us one of the only companies in the world that can scale from the bottom of the tech stack right up to the top. There are certain pure-play digital companies that play in certain arenas. There are certain IPPs that play more at the bottom of the stack. But we're one of, I think, the two companies in the world\u2019s can truly scale top to bottom in that regard. And core to this belief as well, by the way, is the notion that processes will ultimately become more agile, data-driven and automated with a huge focus on CX. We've got some great examples already, by the way, in the portfolio, both vertically as well as horizontally. ATG is a company we acquired in 2018. It's a leader in advisory, implementation and managed services in quote to cash. And that's one example or Lev another Salesforce Platinum Partner that we acquired in 2020 helps business is simplify and modernize marketing campaigns, leveraging Salesforce\u2019s marketing cloud and that really helps them provide data insight and personalization across their customer journey. This, in my mind, is where digital is going. It's not about silo tech stacks. I personally have collapsed our organization to really get at the intersection point of cloud and digital. This is happening when certain other companies are actually doubling down in cloud silos, but I actually think the true value is that intersection point. And I feel we can truly get after new customers, but we're also dislodging certain companies from accounts that they've long held. Some of these companies are private companies, some are public, but we feel we got one of the biggest digital engineering companies in the world, and you'll see us continue to double that in that regard.\nMaggie Nolan: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nKatie Royce: This is Katie. I'd just like to thank you all for taking the time and joining the call, and we look forward to speaking with you in the coming days. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q4 2020 earnings conference call. You may all disconnect your lines at this time, and enjoy the rest of your evening.",

            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon everybody. Today, I'd like to address three topics with you; namely, a brief summary of the fourth quarter, our continuing progress executing our strategy, and our confidence about the future. Let me start with Q4. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This included a negative 120 basis point impact from the exit of content moderation services and a negative 250 basis points impact related to the anticipated exit from a large financial services engagement. This relates to a complex ambitious project that was scoped in late 2018. Over time, both parties realized that the transformation aspect of the project as initially conceived was unlikely to achieve our shared expectations. I'm confident that it is in everyone's interest to manage to an exit. Jan will provide more details on the financial implications of this exit in his remarks. However, I want to underscore that I'm confident in both our client portfolio and our deal review and solutioning processes, many aspects of which we've overhauled in the last year. Excluding the impact from the anticipated exits from this engagement, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations and our guidance. Gross margins increased, cash flow is strong, and we continue to invest significantly to fuel our growth priorities. We maintained our momentum in the quarter with full year 2020 bookings growth in the mid-teens. With over one year of data, assumption tweaks and refinements behind us, our analytics have been improved on going to bookings, bookings growth, including renewals and new business, and bookings to revenue. We entered 2021 with growing confidence in our strategic, operational and commercial progress and a strengthening demand environment. Hi Lisa. Yes, thanks for the question. I'd say we're in the middle. And I think we still have a few years of work ahead of us, but we've made huge progress, and I'm very proud of the team and grateful for everything that they've helped us to do. If you go back two years ago, we talked about a transformation office that started with our strategic direction and refinements, which naturally led to refinements of our company portfolio, both exiting non-strategic elements. Such as content moderation as well as strengthening our digital capabilities with an intensive targeted set of M&A transactions. We're now much more in the strategic execution mode and there are four elements to that. Core to this is globalizing and repositioning the brand. You've seen some recent announcements. We'll have more to go through in the coming weeks and months. That will actually help us with our second goal, that of globalizing Cognizant, which involves really getting after underpenetrated markets internationally, which today still represent approximately a quarter of our revenue as well as giving clients around the world, greater assurance that we have a robust and resilient delivery network. The third goal will be around accelerating digital, and we made good progress there, and we will continue to invest behind this strategic goal and I should point out that clients are very pleased that we are actually showing up with a broader portfolio, giving them optionality and alternatives. And then the fourth point that you'll see us continue to invest in as part of our transformation is increasing our relevance to clients. That has involved us changing out some of our commercial teams, refreshing them bringing in people with much deeper industry knowledge, and indeed, sub industry knowledge and making sure we have client-facing teams who can interface across the entire C-suite of Global 2000 companies. So, we've accomplished a great deal. Some would say against the odds, particularly given COVID and ransomware in the last year. But the team are energized, we're in this together, and we're all committed to do something incredible in the coming years. But that's why, to be very honest, we've also left room in our financial plan in the coming years to continue to invest behind the transformation because we're not done yet. Yes. So look, I think, first of all, it's fair to say, I believe we are more competitive than we have been. I believe we're more client-facing than we have been in recent years. That starts with a tone from the top, but we've also added significant coverage in the course of the last year. In some regards, that's positive, but it should be more positive on a go-forward basis as well because these people that we brought into the company will ultimately become more productive as time goes on. And some of the goodness from that, which will ramp over time, will also be complemented by the fact we've had some disruption this year, because we've been upgrading our client-facing teams. Because we wanted to have a set of client-facing teams who are better capable of conversing across the entire C-suite. So I think we're stronger. We're more energized. We're more client centric. Frankly, we also have a stronger portfolio. We have been aggressive in our M&A stance in the past year. We got a lot of momentum behind the assets we've acquired, and that puts us in a position where we can show up well beyond the CIO, CTO organization and now engage much more broadly at the C-suite. Similarly, I think it is fair to say that the -- there is growing optimism in the market. If I think about client behavior, clients are certainly making investment decisions. It's somewhat of an uncertain background because of where we are with vaccine rollout spread to world. But clients are being decisive. And in decision is the enemy of CEOs of Services Company. So I'm happy to see them making decisions. What are they putting their money behind? Ultimately, growth acceleration, efficiency, agility, scalability, business continuity, of course, this leads to investment decisions, if you will, around Customer 360, customer experience, cloud acceleration, automation, hyper personalization, of course, which brings you with the core and data modernization, AI analytics and machine learning. So this is all happening in a period where we're working in a different manner. And clients have gotten used to working via distributed agile, which I think will fuel different ways of working going forward. I believe it's also giving rise to questions around who strategic partners are, which is why we're really committed to continuing to invest behind industry thought leadership, industry solutions, partnerships, technology consulting and vendor consolidation is real, and I'm delighted to say Cognizant can truly play across build, operate and indeed into transformation innovation with our extended brand. So I feel very good about our position. The market is getting stronger. If anything, right now, what we have is a disconnect between demand supply economics. And I'm worried about skill shortages across the industry. Keith, it's Brian here. That's behind us. Maybe just a little bit of flavor for quarters where Jan wasn't here last year. Q1, as you know, is a tougher compare than the rest of the year because COVID really started being talked more about in the mainstream media and beyond in the month of March. So the last month of Q1 so the compare and financial services and as we think about the shape of the year, we'll still be, let's say, more challenging there as the turnaround efforts continue to take hold against a tougher backdrop. Q2 should be an easier compare for us. And frankly, the easiest compare for us in FSI should be in Q4, given, as Jan said, we've taken financial entries this quarter related to the anticipated exit of this contract. But I'm fully aligned to Jan's point of view, we'd expect a gradual recovery in 2021 with the quarterly I've just given you against the quarters within that. Yes. Maybe if I could just embellish those comments that we made. Hello, Rod. First of all, yes, we feel good about our guidance for 2021. It sees us accelerate revenue, show margin expansion, whilst ultimately investing materially into the future. But I always want to be crystal clear on these calls that our goal is to drive shareholder value creation by positioning Cognizant for medium and long-term success and sustained earnings growth, and I think the best way for us to get about doing that is to get after the revenue opportunities. Look, we're in the middle of a -- what we're calling a multi-year project to reposition the company. I'm genuinely pleased with how the team has come together. We're united. We're ambitious. We're eager to prove our potential. In 2020, I asked the team to pull together to operationalize the transformation agenda. That included strategic, organizational, cultural and indeed financial elements, and some of it was uncomfortable for certain segments of the employee base. But we executed an aggressive M&A strategy to complement our portfolio. We executed a restructuring program. The savings of which allowed us to start reinvesting in the business, including hiring those commercial resources we referenced earlier. And with bookings now up in the mid-teens, the P&L can start to work again. And that was the secret sauce of Cognizant over the years. It was always a growth company fueling investments in our clients with delivery excellence, which afforded us to continue to drive that on a sustainable basis. That's the direction we're taking the company forward. We've got so much more work to do, but I think so much more optimism about the future. And I definitely feel a lot better about our position, because a lot of the heavy lifting of the initial portion of the transformation is behind us. We'll continue to invest in delivery excellence, commercial coverage, our talent, our systems and tools, which were not in my mind fit-for-purpose for a Fortune 200 company. That's why we announced today our intent to go forward with Workday and HCM. You know we're investing heavily between IT and security remediation and modernization. We'll continue to invest in our portfolio and in our brand, and we're feeling pretty comfortable in terms of where we are. So, let me start a little bit with some order questions, Jan, feel free to jump in at any moment here as well. So, first of all, with regards to the delivery organization of where we stand on that, look, we have a demand/supply imbalance, if you will. The market has snapped back aggressively, as evidenced in our strong bookings momentum. I would say that the competition for digital talent is extremely competitive. All major digital domain skills are in high demand across cloud, digital engineering, data, AI and we are, therefore, very much focused on recruitment and attrition. For those of you who track media, you'll see us be much more aggressive in terms of social platforms for hiring. We're doing a luck with our employee base around making sure they see the potential of the company, making sure they understand the growth ambitions of the company, their career opportunities. And so we look forward to trying to optimize that as best we can. But you guys know as much as we do that in a high demand environment, where you have an imbalance, it can lead to certain outcomes. Now, we've got to understand what that means in terms of pricing environment as well to be very, very clear. With regards to utilization, there's a few things happening simultaneously from my perspective. First of all, clients are embracing new ways of working, including distributed agile, and that has been somewhat forced upon them in 2020. But actually, I think it's worked well. And now many clients are looking at real estate consolidation policies and understanding that we can work for them nearshore, onshore or indeed, offshore. The higher the offshore mix can actually help margin rate, but it's not necessarily helpful to margin dollars or indeed revenue dollars. So, we're seeing a trend certainly towards offshore leverage which is pushing the short-term offshore utilization higher as we consume the bench. But I don't know that that's likely to be sustained over the longer term because we plan to increase our hiring, rebuild our benches, and though we are, as I said earlier, in a high demand environment at this moment in time. We're also doing some tactical things internally. We've recently moved our India-based workforce onto a nine-hour Workday, which is in line, I should add, with industry practice which will result in a reduction of utilization in India, in theory, in the next quarter or so by one to two points. But we'll continue to look at utilization and track it and understand how these dynamics play in. Yes. Let me get off. And then Jan, if you've any of the financial elements, please embellished this as well. So first of all, we have a delivery excellent organization. That insurers were aligned to a, a sophisticated set of delivery methods for want of a better words, you could think about these as methodologies, principles, programs, tools. As a Global Fortune 200 company, at any time, we probably have between 20,000 and 25,000 projects or programs underway in our delivery organization. And these projects are constantly reviewed and mapped. It goes without saying. For Cognizant then I bet every other services company out there in the world that at any one-time for a company of our size, there are certain projects that are classified amber, some red. These projects are monitored constantly actions and frankly, senior management right up to me get involved in client discussions as needed. I will say we're on top of this. I've reviewed our entire portfolio over the last few years. I know where we stand. We have enhanced rigor in our dealer review and solutioning processes. Many of those aspects, by the way, have been changed in the past year. And just as a reminder, we have a new CFO, who's pretty hands on. We have a new global delivery leader who came into last year, who's We've been new Chief Admin Officer who's charged, amongst other things, with contract management and pricing. Each of these executives bring their own experience and value on complex deal pursuits, steel solution and pricing, which puts me in a position where I feel confidence where we stand. Look, from the international perspective, we called it global growth markets, which is about 25% of our business. We were quite intentional in the last year that as we're globalizing the company, so too, that we want to localize the company to a certain extent. So that means, as an example, we've recently changed that our Head of Japan. We've hired a Japanese local previously was the Head of Microsoft Japan, prior experience in Oracle, HP, IBM Japan. So somebody with followership amongst clients, somebody would followership with talent and a roster of C-suite networks in the country. That's important to me, but we also need the people who can fit in with Cognizant culture are extremely energetic and really want to do something incredible in the years ahead. I've got to say, it's been an absolute pleasure. We've been able to attract incredible talent to Cognizant across upgrades we've made in the U.K., Ireland, in the Nordics, in Germany, in Australia, New Zealand, in Japan and indeed the new Head of Global Growth Markets, Ursula, who joined us in the month of December as well. And I'm very optimistic that they will ramp rapidly because there are a Class A type personalities, very senior, quick studies. We've helped them already with multiyear business plans to see how we can drive exponential growth in these geographies. Of course, I want to give them time to settle in, but they know that they've been hired with great expectations. And of course, they're charged not just with delivering commercially and from a delivery point of view locally and spending for the principles of the company, but also we are pivoting, transforming the company, the classic, very heavy leverage of application outsourcing, labor arbitrage, India model is being complemented, of course, with much more local selling, solutioning and delivery as we're driving across the entire C-suite to sell projects. So I'm very optimistic. I'm very excited about the potential we have overseas. And I think it's an area that we haven't adequately mined internationally, and it's an area that, frankly should enable us to drive nice growth. The broader talent question ultimately goes back to the market dynamics, which are stronger. If you look at the industry analysts these days, many of them are thinking about growth rate in the 3% to 6% for the entire industry going forward. Digital skills are particularly in demand. And that's something I think the entire industry is facing into. We can control what we will.

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. I'm delighted to be with you on my second earnings call and to be reporting another good quarter, excluding the one-time impact I'll discuss more later. The business performed well, modestly exceeding our expectations during the quarter, driven by solid performance across the board, excluding financial services, and the industry's most directly impacted by COVID, notably retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. For the full year, revenue was $16.7 billion, representing a decline of 0.8% compared to 2019 and a decline of 0.7% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year, this includes a negative 110 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, a negative 70 basis point impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment and a positive approximately 210 basis points of contribution from our acquired businesses. For the full year, digital grew over 13%, it represented approximately 42% of total revenue, an increase of five points as a percentage of total revenue from 2019. Our Q4 revenue was $4.2 billion, representing a decline of 2.3% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Compared with the prior year period, this includes a negative 250 basis points impact of the anticipated exit from a large engagement in our Financial Services segment a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services and a positive 270 basis points of contribution from our acquisitions. Before moving on, I will provide some additional details relating to the anticipated exit from the previously mentioned large engagement. In discussions, the parties agreed that a clean separation would be to our mutual benefit. As a result of those discussions, in the fourth quarter, we made an offer that includes among other terms, a proposed payment and the forgiveness of certain receivables. As a result of this offer, we recorded a $140 million charge in the fourth quarter, which included a reduction to Q4 revenue of $107 million and additional expenses of $33 million, which impacted SG&A primarily related to the impairment of long lived assets. The charge exclusively impacts our Financial Services segment. We are in active discussions and hope to have a finalized agreement in the near future. Now, moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 11.4% and including a negative 730 basis points impact from the anticipated contract exit. Excluding this impact, banking and insurance both declined mid-single digits, in banking, growth in regional and retail banking in North America was more than offset by weakness in cards and payments clients. Insurance also performed below our expectations, driven primarily by weakness in North America. Health care grew 3.3%, which included similar performance in both in the US payer business and life sciences. Life sciences revenue was strong among our pharmaceutical clients, further enhanced by the expansion of our portfolio of services as a result of our acquisitions of Zenith Technologies. Growth was partially offset by the continued weakness in medical device clients, which have been impacted by reduced elective procedures volumes. Our Healthcare payer business had the best performance in seven quarters, with strength in software license sales from the addition of several new logos. Products and Resources declined 2.4% as low double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities was offset by double-digit declines in the travel and hospitality industry, and a high single-digit decline in retail and consumer goods, while still challenged on a year-over-year basis, we have witnessed some stabilization in the last two quarters, particularly within retail and consumer goods, which grew modestly on a sequential basis. Communications, media and technology grew 3.4%, which included a negative 790 basis points impact from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Outside of this impact, we remain very pleased with the business momentum within technology. Communications and media growth accelerated sequentially and grew low double-digit growth year-over-year, helped in part by several of our acquisitions. Now, moving on to margins. In 0Q4, our GAAP operating margin was 11.1% and adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 12.3%. Both our GAAP and adjusted operating margin included a negative 300 basis points impact related to the anticipated contract exit, which includes an approximately 160 basis points impact to gross margin. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.59, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, which both included a negative $0.25 per share impact from the anticipated contract exit. Our adjusted tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter, reflecting the change -- the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, which generated losses that are not tax deductible. Adjusted operating margin declined approximately 470 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the charge related to the anticipated contract exit, high incentive compensation, annual merit increases and investments in organic and inorganic revenue growth. Savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E and favorable movement in the rupee partially offset this pressure. During the quarter, we completed our Fit for Growth program, achieving $530 million in gross annualized savings through continued cost discipline, which has allowed us to accelerate our growth investments. The majority of savings achieved under this program benefits our gross margin, while the accelerated pace of investments is primarily being captured in SG&A. These investments include an accelerated pace of acquisitions which we believe are key to our business transformation, additional sales hiring, repositioning the Cognizant brand and hiring more senior talent in international markets to drive growth. We manage the business at the operating margin level and therefore, believe it is a better metric to judge the profitability of the business. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or $2 billion net of debt. As a reminder, at the end of October, we fully repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility of $1.7 billion. Cash flow in Q4 was again strong, with free cash flow of $809 million. This brought our full year free cash flow to $2.9 billion. DSO ended the year at 70 days, representing a year-over-year improvement of 3 days. In '21, we expect to see our free cash flow decline from 2020 levels as a result of several benefits we experienced this year, which will not repeat in 2021. These include government offered deferrals of certain tax payments and a lower cash payment related to our 2019 annual incentive compensation, which was paid in Q1 2020. Our outlook for '21 assumes free cash flow conversion will return to more normalized levels around 100% of net income as we focus on building upon the DSO improvements achieved this year. We opportunistically utilized our strong free cash flow in 2020 and continue to achieve capital deployment strategy, utilizing over 110% of annual free cash flow. In 2020, we spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions, representing approximately 40% of our full year free cash flow. We returned approximately 70% of our free $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $480 million in dividends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion on India earnings. This decision allows us to more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, giving us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. Over the next several years, we plan to deploy 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. We intend to allocate 50% of free cash flow towards M&A in areas aligned with our strategic priorities. The remaining 50% will be allocated to dividends and share repurchases, targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio of approximately 25% and repurchases to offset dilution annually. While these are a set of guiding principles, we will continue to be opportunistic in our allocation of capital, as well as leverage our strong balance sheet. In support of this strategy, during the fourth quarter, the Board approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, and today we are announcing a 9% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. The second consecutive year of increase since initiated the dividend in 2017. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.34 billion to $4.38 billion, representing 2.8% to 3.8% growth, or 1% to 2% in constant currency based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 180 basis points impact. This outlook assumes an improving yet still cautious start to the year with continued macro uncertainty. We expect stabilization in financial services and continued pressure across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality and communications and media, Q1 also still includes an approximately 85 basis points of headwind from the exit of certain content services. For the full year, we expect revenue of $17.6 billion to $18.1 billion, representing 5.5% to 8.5% growth, or 4% to 7% in constant currency, based on our expectation that currency will have a favorable 150 basis points impact. This outlook includes approximately 300 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue and assumes improving revenue momentum from Q1 levels. Our full year outlook assumes an approximately 30 basis point headwind from the exit of content services. To put the full year guidance and better perspective, there are several factors impacting the quarterly guidance to highlight. First, keep in mind, our Q2 2020 actuals included a combined impact of COVID and the ransomware attack, which will lead to easier year-over-year comparison Q2 2021 and growth levels above our full year outlook. Second, the charge recognized in Q4 related to the anticipated exit from the customer engagement will create challenging year-over-year compares through Q3 and then an easy compare in Q4. However, this does not impact full year revenue comparisons. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. We expect margins in Q1 to be at the low end of that range and to operate within the range each quarterly period for the full year. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.90 to $4.02. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $20 million to $30 million versus $119 million in 2020. As a result, of the $1.2 billion cash repatriation in the fourth quarter, which moved cash from India to other jurisdictions with lower yields. Our outlook soon average shares outstanding of approximately $530 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. With that, we will open the call for questions. Yes. I'll jump in and kick us off on the bookings side, because I think I mentioned in my last call, I had to do some formal training to dive in and deeper understand our bookings number. And I did so. Our full year bookings growth for this year was in the mid-teens. But as I learned, of course, bookings numbers -- we offer this bookings number for illustrative purposes to convey basically, the distribution momentum and self momentum and success we have with our clients, and you should see it as that. Brian mentioned in his in his notes that we continually improve review and understanding of this bookings number, and we made good progress in the fourth quarter. So I'm delighted that, the momentum continues basically in the mid-teens. We did make some adjustments to our bookings number as we shifted a little bit the bookings between the quarters. But the full year number is similar to what we've reported in the third quarter 15 -- round the mid-teens. And then, Brian, do you want to give some more detail on digital bookings and distribution up bookings? Yes. This -- I can add a little bit more color around the exit from this financial services engagement. It's really contained in the fourth quarter. So we put the charge in revenues and -- on the bottom line. And what we -- and that impact on financial services in the fourth quarter had a growth impact of 7 -- a little bit more than 7%, I think I said. And with that, financial services performance continue to be declining in the fourth quarter and has been a weak spot in our performance. So I anticipate that we're -- as Brian and I indicated that we're going to be stabilizing financial services performance throughout the fiscal year and end up in a stabilized way for Financial Services. They're all taken in Q4. There should be no more impact in '21. Yes. Maybe I'll jump in with setting the framework. Our guidance includes the impact of acquisitions that we have announced and closed as of today, and is anticipated. These acquisitions will create margin pressure for us in 2021, approximately 100 basis points or so, roughly. And that is built into as well as our continued investment of building out our organic growth capabilities, our investments into marketing, et cetera. So the guidance includes the substantive continuation of our strategic initiatives into 2021. That was very important for Brian and me as we devised our budget process that we continue committed to executing that strategy, which is a multi-year strategy. Future acquisitions, as I indicated, we're planning to continue on our M&A strategy, where I illustrated our capital allocation outlook and plan. So if we were to spend another $1 billion on acquisitions. That would be incremental margin pressure that is now built could be incremental margin pressure. That's not built into our guidance as always will be incremental. But I think the plan as it is provides full support of the strategic direction that Brian illustrated earlier."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cognizant Q3 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Katie. \nKatie Royce: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. \n By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.\n The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\n Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.\n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. \nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Katie. \n Good afternoon, everybody, and a warm welcome to Jan, who many of you know, in what is his first Cognizant earnings call. Today, I'd like to address 4 topics with you, namely, a brief summary of the third quarter; an update on our employee engagement; observations on the demand environment and clients' evolving needs; and our strategic focus areas as we aim to revitalize revenue growth.\n Let's start with the third quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year in constant currency. Excluding the negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, revenue grew 60 basis points year-over-year.\n We executed well in what remains a challenging environment. Highlights of the quarter include: continued commercial momentum with bookings growth in excess of 25% year-over-year; ongoing momentum in digital with revenue growth up 13% year-over-year and continued strength in digital bookings and qualified pipeline; gross margin and cash flow strength, enabling us to continually invest in the business; and significantly increased and sustained financial flexibility on India earnings and cash. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his prepared remarks.\n Moving to our second topic, I would like to briefly address our talented associates. I'm grateful to each of them for their professionalism and perseverance in serving our clients during this protracted pandemic, which has put a tremendous strain on families and compressed their lives to screens and homes. We could not have executed against our commitments in 2020 without their client centricity, work ethic and engagement.\n Given our financial performance and in recognition of the contributions of our associates, we are creating 2020 bonuses at higher levels than 2019. We are also implementing targeted merit increases and promotions in the fourth quarter. Both will hurt our cost structure in 2020 versus the prior year, but are an essential and normalized part of the cost structure in the services business.\n In stressful times like these, we are especially attentive to employee engagement, a measure of how committed and connected people are to our company. Our recent Cognizant people engagement survey showed scores consistently above industry benchmarks. And our overall engagement score meaningfully increased versus prior surveys.\n In an external endorsement of sorts, Forbes Magazine just ranked Cognizant #19 out of 750 companies across 45 countries in its World's Best Employers list. These high levels of employee engagement, coupled with current economic environment, contributed to our fifth consecutive quarter of reductions in voluntary attrition. We anticipate some sequential increases in voluntary attrition in the coming quarters after the forthcoming merit-based promotions and salary increase cycle.\n We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all our associates, and remain in a work from home and restricted travel posture with only limited exceptions.\n Now I'd like to turn to clients, and in particular, the trends we are seeing. These trends fall into 2 categories, 1 cyclical and 1 secular. First, on the cyclical side and set against a protracted pandemic, clients are increasingly decisive on their technology priorities. They are focused on cost savings, CapEx reductions, resiliency and agility. This is slowing large project deployments with extended paybacks, but creating other opportunities. We are seeing accelerated vendor consolidation trends, which we stand to benefit from given our deep strategic relationships and client references in buildup rate, and our enhanced portfolio and growing reputation in digital, where more and more clients want to see us challenge digital incumbents.\n Client focus on innovation and cost savings is also creating opportunities for incumbent vendor displacement as larger deals. We plan to be disciplined and selective in our pursuit of larger deals, including captives, as these transactions, if not well conceived, can bring diluted compound annual growth rates, margin pressure and unfavorable terms.\n I want to focus my comments on the more consequential secular trend, digital transformation. This is our top priority. It goes to the heart of client business model innovation, transformation and experiences. COVID-19 has widened the digital divide between the digital natives and legacy economy companies, which have struggled to shift to a fully digital operating model. These industrial era companies have focused on upgrading their tech stack at the infrastructure, data and application layers. They have migrated their apps and data to the cloud, and improved the agility of their underlying technology. These improvements, however important, all short of delivering the full power of digital transformation as they optimize the technology foundation rather than the business process or operating model. I believe the industry is at an inflection point in digital adoption.\n We see growing client interest in realizing more immediate customer and business value by identifying use cases to shift to agile digital workflows. That means transforming processes to become agile, data-driven and automated. So workflows can be industry-specific such as claims and policy management or pharmacovigilance, or horizontal such as close to cash or digital marketing. In such cases, how we engineered an agile digital workflow for a leading app pro company that needed a return to work and to store strategy. We offered our safe workforce solution, built on the Salesforce work -- platform. This comprehensive employee safety solution provides management with information about public health conditions, office capacity employee health and shift schedules. We can stagger arrival times to minimize contract, encourage hygiene through automated reminders and when connected with IoT centers, help enforce social distancing and occupancy limits.\n As more clients implement agile digital workflows, the digital services market is evolving into a third phase. In Phase 1 of digital, clients sought to understand what digital really meant to their industries. In Phase 2, the implemented digital experiments and projects at the edge of their enterprises. In Phase 3, clients realize they must be software-driven enterprises and digital to their core.\n So what does this shift to agile digital workflows mean for services companies, and who will be the winners? The first and perhaps most obvious thing to say is that there will be more than one winner. That being said, everything we are doing as a company, from our strategy, solution portfolio, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, branding and marketing and talent is focused on being one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new phase in digital. \n To become modern businesses and create business value, companies need to embrace a digital technology stack that consists of: personalized and engaging customer and employee experiences, enabled by software engineering, powered by customer and operational intelligence, driven by data and run on a modern cloud business platform. We haven't always done a great job marketing this, but we are one of the few firms in the world with solutions and partnerships across every layer of this stack.\n Inorganic investments have strengthened our SaaS partnerships with both Salesforce and Workday, complementing long-standing relationships with SAP, Oracle and ServiceNow to offer clients the full suite of enterprise application services they require to modernize their core processes and enable agile digital workflows. In the last 6 months, we have further strengthened our partnership commitment to all 3 leading hyperscale providers, announcing the formation of dedicated business groups for both Microsoft and AWS, and investing to enhance our Google Cloud credentials. Whatever approach a client wants to take to become a modern business, our portfolio adds multiple overlaps.\n Let's say a client wants to start at the bottom of the digital technology stack by accelerating cloud migration. We can do this for them, driving efficiencies that can subsequently be invested in innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing for a global automotive manufacturer that came to us for help to bring agility, innovation and efficiency to their business processes. We started by executing an agile delivery model for core modernization. We then deployed our one DevOps model across the clients, dealers, supply chain, accessories, parts and incentives, improving speed, flexibility and user experience.\n In another example, we're engaged in partnership with Snowflake in a digital transformation project for a leading financial services firm. We're building a cloud-based intelligent data platform that facilitates multiple analytical and machine-based use cases. This platform unlocks innovation opportunities and value-added use cases, including real-time intelligence for fraud detection, a better user experience for opening and reactivating accounts, a reduction in loan dispute processing time and improved field agent selling effectiveness.\n More and more clients are, however, starting at the top of the digital technology stack, by focusing on the customer and employee experience. Such experiences can be continuously improved through the magic of human-centric insights, software product engineering, automation and applied AI. And hyper personalization, all of which ultimately requires clients to embark on a core and data modernization journey.\n That's what we did for a large global insurance company -- Cognizant to design, implement and run a new direct-to-consumer business that will provide a compelling AI-enabled interactive experience to consumers and agents. Recognizing this needed to be integrated with existing core systems and data architectures, we then worked with AWS to host this in a scalable modern digital platform.\n In these examples, you will see the opportunity to create a flywheel effect, a virtuous cycle, which Cognizant and our clients stand well positioned to benefit from. In a world of vendor consolidation, Cognizant is one of the few firms that can capture this opportunity.\n I'd now like to turn to the company's future, and our goal to increase our relative commercial momentum and revitalized revenue growth.\n In the knowledge-based business, investing for growth starts with attracting, developing and retaining talent. In the last 6 months, we have overhauled our talent management and annual performance evaluation processes, which allow us to develop a diverse, inclusive and high-performance team, where talent is identified and nurtured for promotions. \n Meanwhile, we have invested in growth by strengthening our country leadership with senior hires in Germany, the Nordics, Australia and Asia Pacific Japan. Earlier this week, we also announced the completion of our Executive Committee with the announcement of our new President for Global Growth Markets, and the newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chairman for Cognizant India. We've also rallied the organization behind what we call the Cognizant Agenda, which articulates our purpose, vision and values. Our vision is to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite. To achieve this, we are aligned behind a series of both moves that require investments.\n First, we will meaningfully increase investments in branding and marketing including launching a breakthrough global brand campaign in the coming months. This campaign will reposition the Cognizant brand, and will reach beyond our familiar technology audience to the entire C-suite as well as the next generation of talent.\n Second, we will continue to accelerate digital. Our priority areas of digital engineering, AI and analytics, cloud and IoT are more relevant than ever to clients. We aim to lead in the third phase of digital, which will require continued investment in M&A, our commercial and delivery capabilities, offer management, talent and branding.\n Third, we will continue to globalize Cognizant by investing for growth in targeted countries, strengthening our regional capabilities, scaling our brand internationally and executing a global delivery network that will ensure greater resiliency in our delivery capabilities.\n And fourth, we will continue to make investments that increase our relevance to clients by strengthening our industry expertise and technology consulting capabilities, investing in our talent and extending our solution integrator and designer competency.\n As we invest for growth, we will also continue to leverage our balance sheet to accelerate our strategy. Our M&A strategy continues to be focused on advancing our digital priorities across the globe. Last month, we closed the acquisition of Tin Roof Software, a custom software and digital product development services company that expands our software product engineering footprint in the United States.\n And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of 10th Magnitude, one of Microsoft's longest-standing Azure-centric partners. This deal expands the Microsoft Azure expertise within our new Microsoft business group and adds development on managed services hubs throughout the United States.\n And last week, we agreed to acquire Bright Wolf, a technology services provider that specializes in custom industrial IoT solutions for Fortune 1000 companies, which will expand our smart products and Industry 4.08 expertise.\n In short, we are committed to growth, and we'll continue to make meaningful investments to ensure we increase our relevance to clients and enhance our competitiveness. While the macro and political backdrop remain uncertain, come what may, our goal is to ensure we outgrow the market, just like we did in the third quarter, whilst remaining commercially disciplined.\n In closing, I would remind you that 18 months ago, when we set Cognizant's transformation in motion aimed at returning the company to be the IT services industry bellwether, we knew this would be a multiyear endeavor, and our view has not changed. While we continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, we are encouraged by our progress. Our employees are energized united by our shared purpose and vision. We're excited about our strengthening competitive position, the opportunity to expand internationally and the opportunity presented by the third phase of digital.\n There will be several big winners in this attractive market, and we aim to be one of them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the third quarter and our fiscal year outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. \nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. \n I'm very happy to be part of the Cognizant team and look forward to connecting with all of you going forward. From the onset, I was intrigued by Cognizant's meaningful growth opportunity, and my first weeks in the job have more than confirmed my initial assessment. I will work hard to fill Karen's shoes and wanted to say a big thank you to her for making my onboard so smooth and seamless.\n Moving on to Q3 results. Third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was flat year-over-year or a decline of 70 basis points at constant currency. Compared to the prior year period, this includes a positive 250 basis points contribution from inorganic growth and a negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain content-related services. Sequentially, we saw a broad-based improvement in the business, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IoT and software engineering.\n Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 2.2% with similar performance in both banking and insurance. Retail banking improved in the quarter, driven by regional banks, while capital markets returned to growth after several quarters of softness. However, we continue to see weakness across global banking accounts and with clients in the payment sector. We continue to expect below company average performance in the Financial Services segment for the next several quarters.\n Healthcare grew 4.2% led by double-digit growth in life sciences, driven by strong growth in the biopharma clients, and included the contribution of the Zenith acquisition which we lapped mid quarter. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness in the medical device clients.\n Within our health care vertical, revenue saw modest growth. After 6 quarters of decline, we are pleased with early signs of improvements in the health care business, we see improvement in the payer segment across key accounts which is offsetting the decline in the provider market that continues to be negatively impacted by COVID.\n Products and Resources declined 4.6%, with double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and high single-digit declines in retail and consumer goods. While we saw strength in bookings in retail and consumer goods, we expect continued pressure in 2021 as a result of the ongoing pandemic.\n Communications, Media and Technology was flat, including the approximately negative $57 million year-over-year impact to technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Excluding this negative 920 basis point impact, growth in Communications, Media and Technology was approximately 9%. Communications and media grew mid-single digits as growth in communications and education clients offset continued weakness in media and entertainment. We expect pressure in media and entertainment into 2021.\n While overall, we saw improved momentum across the business, the demand environment remains uncertain. But we believe we are gaining traction across industries as reflected in the strong bookings and pipeline numbers Brian referenced earlier.\n Moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 14.2% and $0.64, respectively. GAAP EPS reflects $140 million or $0.20 -- $0.26 per share income tax expense related to the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings. I'll comment more on that decision later in my prepared remarks.\n Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.9%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation and the dilutive impact of our recently completed acquisitions, which more than offset savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E expense and the favorable movement in the rupee. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred $43 million of charges related to the Fit for Growth Plan. The actions drove continued cost discipline, which allowed us to further invest into our growth initiatives. The majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete, and we have achieved our savings targets. \n We expect charges to be approximately $200 million in annualized gross run rate savings of $520 million to $550 million in 2021.\n While we don't anticipate charges under Fit for Growth to continue in 2021, we will continue to invest savings achieved to help accelerated growth aligned behind the 4 strategic areas Brian outlined: repositioning the Cognizant brand, accelerating digital, globalizing the company, increasing our relevance with clients.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of September 30, stood at $4.6 billion or a net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net debt balances include the approximate $1.7 billion drawn on our revolving credit facilities in the first quarter 2020. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating $821 million of free cash flow, largely driven by improved collections of our receivables. DSO improved 5 days year-over-year to 72 days.\n Before turning to guidance, I will provide additional details on our decision to reverse our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings totaling $5.2 billion. The decision was made based on our strategic priorities to accelerate growth in international markets, and to expand our global delivery footprint, changes to the India budget enacted in April, and changes to the U.S. tax regulations that became effective in September. This reversal resulted in a onetime GAAP-only tax cost of approximately $140 million, and makes those earnings available globally.\n In October, we distributed $2.1 billion from our subsidiary in India, which resulted in a net $2 billion cash transfer from India after payment of India withholding tax.\n Importantly, on a go-forward basis, we can now more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, which gives us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. While we are reviewing our capital allocation plan, we initiated our share repurchase program, and intend to repay our credit facilities by the end of this month. The share repurchase activity will offset a portion of the EPS impact from the lost interest income historically generated from cash balances held in India. While interest rates in India have steadily declined in the last several quarters, year-to-date, that cash had earned roughly 5%. This generated approximately $95 million of interest income or $0.13 per share. Since September, we have deployed over $700 million on share buybacks, repurchasing approximately 10 million shares.\n Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. While we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline of the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely be impacted by the pace of economic recovery and thus, clients' confidence and spend. We are reaffirming revenue guidance at the high end of our previously guided range.\n Specifically, for the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline approximately 0.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rate, this translates to a decline of 0.5% up to approximately $16.7 billion on a reported basis.\n Our revenue guidance includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to the full year revenue from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business that will be reflected in our CMT segment and a positive contribution of approximately 200 basis points from closed acquisitions.\n This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Financial Services, and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portions of our Products and Resources segment.\n For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental costs associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1, and incentive compensation above 2019 levels.\n Our current guidance also assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and the typical cycle of furloughs.\n We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.63 to $3.67. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations in the 8-K we filed today for a full definition. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 541 million shares and GAAP tax rate of approximately 32%, which implies a Q4 tax rate of approximately 27%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. \n With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question today is coming from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: Congratulations on the quarter. Maybe I'll just ask 2 quick ones upfront in the interest of time. First off, in light of what's happened recently with SAP, we've been getting a lot of questions just around the size of the practice that you guys may still have in that area. So any sizing you can give us there would be helpful.\n And then can you just comment on -- with the digital bookings growth being strong as it has been, I think you're up 40% year-to-date. When does that start translating to faster digital revenue growth? I know we've been hovering in kind of the almost the mid-teens range here the last couple of quarters.\n And then that kind of dovetails with a related question of do you think revenue growth could actually turn positive in Q1? I know previously, you said that we may still see negative growth through the first quarter of next year, but obviously, you're on a better trajectory now. \nBrian Humphries: Jason, it's Brian. So let me take a shot at this. These may be for Jan. By all means feel free to jump in if you see incremental details to add. \n So SAP as a practice, it's multiple hundred millions of dollars for us. It's sub-$1 billion. It is actually a very healthy business for us, and I have been in touch with the SAP leadership team in recent periods to see what we can do to accelerate our momentum there. It's pretty intuitive, what they're doing. But in the same way, it's also interesting for us given our ambition to scale much more internationally and given the installed base of SAP. So it's a partner that really is strategic to us, and we will continue to work closely with.\n Digital bookings. Look, more broadly, if I stand back from this. Bookings are strong overall, and it's broad-based by geography, by industry, by new and expansion versus renewals, and digital bookings are continuing to be strong as well. So what's been very pleasing to me is in the course of the last year, we have consistently shown strong bookings growth year-over-year. That has enabled us to actually build a stronger backlog through the year. And now we're in a very healthy position, healthier than we've been before. And of course, the pipeline, as Jan suggested earlier, is strong as well. Not just strong overall, but also strong in visual, in particular, and strong in the strategic accounts that we focused on as part of our customer segmentation exercise in the -- model. So I feel really good about our momentum there.\n The timing of all of this to revenue can vary by quarter, of course, and in the face of economic environment, which is unsettled to say the very least, including announcements made tonight across Europe. But we're pleased with what we've done. And if this continues, it all goes very well for our future.\n We're not going to make commentary around Q1 or indeed, fiscal year '21 at this moment in time. The only thing I'll say is we will continue to try to outgrow the industry. That's what we did this quarter. We think we're more competitive than we've been before. And we're absolutely committed to growth and to make -- investments to grow. If that means compromising some margins in the short term to achieve, we will absolutely do that. But I'm expecting performance to improve in 2021, but we'll share more details of that, of course, Q4 earnings. But the big caveat around this is what we're going through this some on time, which is a very uncertain macroeconomic environment. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. \nLisa Dejong Ellis: Congratulations. All right. So with the election, inevitably causes and triggers some discussions and questions related to H1B visas and L1 visas. Can you just remind us what fraction of Cognizant's U.S. labor force is currently on visas? What sort of your level of dependence and focuses on that program, and maybe kind of a little bit of the movie of how your labor force structure has evolved over the last few years and how that's evolving going forward.\n Maybe I'll just dovetail that into my other kind of observation was just that you actually had head count increase sequentially quarter-to-quarter and that utilization is way up. Attrition is way down. Are you kind of at where you want to be with your labor force at this point going forward? \nBrian Humphries: Lisa, Brian here. So let's start first with the headcount situation. I think our utilization levels are now quite high. We tightened our belt earlier in the year as I think every company in the world did, but we've seen somewhat of a V-shaped recovery, particularly in the digital side of our business. And as such, we're at the stage now that our bench is light, and we're committed as a leadership team to build that out. And we've already started that over the last month or so. But it takes time, of course, to get that built out.\n Obviously, we want to continue to drive more operational rigor around forecasting, which triggers enterprise resource management and all of that to make sure we have the right resources in the right place at the right time. So you will see us continue to build out our capabilities with evergreen skills or hot skills, as we would call them, and build upon our capabilities such that we can reduce utilization, which is a little bit higher at this moment in time.\n I am pleased with the employee engagement. I am pleased that voluntary attrition is down for the fifth quarter in a row. Notwithstanding that we're really pushing meritocracy and a performance culture these days. So you have seen a big bifurcation between voluntary versus involuntary attrition. And we do expect voluntary attrition to pick up a little bit in the coming quarters as we go through the merit-based promotion and salary cycle we're going through. And I underscore the word merit-based.\n With regards to H1B visas, look, it's quite topical, but perhaps I could stand hand back here a little bit and talk because the administrative rule changes with regards to skilled integration leases that have been quite topical in recent weeks. Some of those have been enjoyed through litigation already. And for other elements, there are challenges pending at this moment in time. So whether the rules, survive or not remains to be seen.\n All that being said, I actually think all roads are leading this direction anyway. So we will always intend to comply with the letter of the law to use these applications and any extensions we intend to pursue.\n We are a H1B visa, I would say, dependent organization. You used the word evolution, and I think that's the right word. Over the years, we have reduced our dependency in visas, and we've also acquired companies that enable us to be more global in nature. But in the same vein, some of the strategic decisions we took, which were in the right decisions, including exiting a portion of content moderation, has put us back a little bit. That being said, the rule is solely triggered by new applications and extensions. And H1B visas are currently under a 3-year visa. So this will roll in gradually. And I would say, I don't want to reassure everybody, our intention is to globalize Cognizant. And so you'll see us build out much more of a global-based workforce to meet client expectations, whilst, of course, stay focused on quality of delivery.\n And that will include a whole host of things that we will do, including U.S. college campus recruiting, upskilling and just a broader effort around a local employee base in the U.S. and indeed globally. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. \nAshwin Shirvaikar: My question is on the health care vertical, and it's good to see the improvement. Question is with regards to the sustainability of that and the investments that you're making in various health care capabilities, including, but not limited to TriZetto? And on the topic of TriZetto with the Atos settlement, was that included in the cash forecast that you have? What does it mean from an operational perspective in terms of your client relationships, if you could address those questions. \nBrian Humphries: So Jan, I'll touch on the health care business. If you want to touch upon then the cash flow and the cash balance and the Syntel settlement, which we were pleased to see yesterday. So Ashwin, first of all, health care is really important to us. It's almost 30% of the total company, and it consists of 2 major portions. One is life sciences. We're doing really well there. We have been for a long time. It's highly strategic to us. You are seeing the lapping of Zenith technology, which happened in Q3 of 2020. So that will impact growth rates a little bit. \n But I'm very optimistic around the opportunities in life sciences at the intersection point of biopharma medical devices. Right through to industry 4.0 health care, retail and indeed health tech. And I spent a number of hours on that with the team over the weekend. So we're really pumped around what we can do there, and you will see us continue to invest in it.\n The majority of the businesses, however, the U.S. health care business, which is split between payer and providers. The payer business accelerated meaningfully this quarter, which strengthened services and indeed in products. We have a new leader who took over the Healthcare business earlier this year, an internal promotion, who has done a fantastic job, and this entire team are doing great for us. Bookings are very strong. Product growth is strong. We're getting new logos. Margins are improving. And we're just generally feeling very good, a better payer business.\n The provider business, which is much smaller than our payer business, saw significant erosion year-over-year in the third quarter as did the industry. As you know, the provider business is suffering from transaction volumes that are decreasing because the pandemic is obviously reducing elective procedures. And I would say that's an area that we would expect to come back but more holistically, the momentum we're seeing in payers, which is 3/4 of the business, and life sciences will give us confidence that we can continue to pull strong health care results going forward. We're improving. Jan, over to you. \nJan Siegmund: Yes. Let me add a few comments to the Syntel lawsuit. You may have seen this morning that we won a jury verdict of $854 million. This lawsuit has a long history for Cognizant. And at the core is our claim that Syntel misappropriated TriZetto's intellectual property related to some software products during that time and -- while Syntel was a TriZetto subcontractor. And the jury verdict, which found no liability for TriZetto or Cognizant, basically speaks for itself. We're gratified with the results. But at Atos, the owner of Syntel, has already indicated that they're planning to appeal the verdict. So it will be quite a bit out, I think, until we have the final results of this trial coming, too. So way too early to take that cash into account for any actions. Nevertheless, I think it was satisfying to see the jury decide with Cognizant's position. \n Relative to the cash repatriation, it might be worthwhile just spending an extra minute on it, too. So we had about a cash balance in India of $2.1 billion. And we -- at the end of September, reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion and decided to repatriate that cash from India. And as part of that decision, we could make that decision for 2 reasons. \n The most important one is strategically driven actually because we are executing well on our strategy to globalize the enterprise, and we'll continue to invest into international markets. And for that, capital will be needed. But number two, also, the '21 -- fiscal year '21 India budget enacted in April and some changes in U.S. tax regulations allowed us to remediate this cash on a cost-effective basis, and we did so actually in October.\n The cash balances in India historically have earned some interest on the cash balances -- on the cash that we have there. And approximately, I think, as I said in the script, about 5%. And the -- we offsetting -- we used some of the cash that we returned from India and cash at hand to repurchase shares during the month of September and October. And the accretion created to the share buybacks is actually approximately offsetting the contribution that our interest income would have generated in India. So the outlook is quite balanced as a starting point. And obviously, we're excited about the go-forward benefit of this transaction because we, going forward, have now full flexibility and full access to our free cash flow on a global basis. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. \nBryan Bergin: Just thinking about your largest verticals here. So you've turned the corner on health care. I wanted to ask on Financial Services. I hear the commentary on lower-than-average growth for the next few quarters. I'm curious what you're seeing in the areas of the clients. And whether it's still limited to only a handful of the former large banking accounts. Really, how close are you to the end of the tunnel on stabilizing those? And what do you think you need to do in those areas to really turn the corner in Financial Services, too? \nBrian Humphries: Bryan, so I would say, yes, it remains challenged. Look, first of all, just like health care, financial services, so the greatest impact from ransomware. But the Financial Services results, I'd almost cut them into 2 portions of discussion. First of all, insurance -- and as you know, the insurance industry has really been pressured, to say the very late in the last year, both at a pandemic level, insurance rebates and automobiles, SMB businesses, interrupted failures. That's impacting the property as of the insurance entry. And of course, mortality rates of life carriers. And then on top of that to make matters worse, catastrophic events and low interest rates. So that sector is under pressure.\n Our business is, let's say, 80% of our insurance business is in North America, so a little bit more than the average company. It's one of our strongest franchises, but it will decline in this year, in 2020. So we need to turn it around. We need to improve the pipeline. To be very honest, booking have been strong, but the pipeline isn't strong enough. Our leader has retired in the last month or so, so we have some new energy in there. And hopefully, we can get that back on track.\n Banking. Look, if I paint the macro picture first. As we've implied in the prepared remarks, capital markets, retail and commercial banking grew year-over-year. Cards or payments were down. With regards to some of the larger global banking clients that you referenced, it's more of a handful. Some of that, to be very honest, relates to ransomware we were turning some around. Some is self-inflicted wounds related to a lack of appropriate senior origin in the client partners we had. And some of it relates to secular pressure towards in-sourcing that we're seeing at those banks.\n Now what do we do to turn all around this entire situation. I'm confident we'll get insurance back on track. I think we'll also continue to make progress in the North America regional banks. And we've even brought some accounts into platinum account status this quarter, i.e., they surpassed $100 million. But in the same vein, we have a lot of work to do in our current accounts, and that includes scaling more into digital in those banks. The good news is our digital bookings in those banks are up in excess of 50%. So we are starting to get our foot in the door. We continue to upgrade our client partners, and we're continuing to try to do a much more sophisticated job in terms of account planning.\n In the same vein, right up to the executive committee, me included, we are trying to break into some of the other large banks. And I think we're making progress actually on 2 in particular. So hopefully, we'll have some good news on that in the foreseeable future.\n Europe and banking just remains weak. We lost an account there in the last year, and we have some transformation project issues and 1 large account over there. It is fixable, but I just don't see the momentum turning around there as quickly in banking overall, as I have seen in health care. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. \nRod Bourgeois: Okay. Great. Nice progress by Cognizant in these results. I want to ask a high-level question. Recognizing that the COVID pandemic is continuing here. Do you see Cognizant as still somewhat in a crisis response and basic blocking-and-tackling mode? Or have you transitioned now into a more forward-moving strategic attack mode? I guess the main part of the question here is, assuming you are in a transition, what are the next set of metrics you're most focused on to gauge Cognizant's progress moving forward here. \nBrian Humphries: Thanks, Rod. Brian here. So look there's a short answer and there's a long answer, so I'm going to give you something in between. First of all, I really feel good about the progress we've made in the last 18 months. We've actually done a lot, probably more than people realize. Clarified our strategy. We executed the nonstrategic portion of the business. We executed a restructuring program. We used some of the proceeds from that to reinvest back in the business. We meaningfully improved our digital portfolio competencies and partnerships. We've built a strong professional, mature, client-centric leadership team. We've begun a pretty significant commercial transformation that is showing positive leading indicators and pipeline win rates, bookings. And we put, I would say, a better business management system in place to ensure optimal financial and operational rigor. And we did all of that, to be very honest, in a period that I was not expecting. \n We managed through global pandemics that impacted both demand as well as fulfillment. We navigated a ransomware attack well, and I want to say that humbly. But we did as best as we could, and we've actually received good client feedback on that. We've improved employee engagement to levels not seen for a few years, and that reduced voluntary attrition at 5 quarters in a row. And we've managed to put ourselves in a position that we built a multiyear plan that incorporates sustained investments.\n So I'd characterize all of that as pleased, but not satisfied, to be very honest. We're not in finish product yet. We're in the middle of a multiyear project. And we must continue to, of course, as we've said, reposition the brand, execute our strategy, globalize the company, take advantage of the opportunity overseas, globalize our delivery, build on our growing momentum in health care, and fix financial services and, of course, accelerate our position in digital, which just simply exposes us to higher categories of growth and makes us more relevant to clients.\n If we do all of this, our bookings momentum will continue, and ultimately, this will translate to revenue growth. And so Rod, everything else at some stage becomes a leading indicator: pipeline, win rates, the leadership team, the bookings. Our goal here is to invest in the business to get back to growth. If we do that, growth accelerates and we will show margin expansion but in a very calculated manner that allows us to sustainably reinvest back into the business. I say all of this with a great deal of caveats given the uncertain macroeconomic situation we're in at this moment in time. \n That being said, I'll just wrap up by saying, I'm really proud of our team and of our associates around the world. I'm confident of the unity of our leadership team, the absolute support of our Board of Directors who've been tremendously supportive of what we're doing, and our growing execution rigor. And honestly, I think we're on track. We're increasingly competitive, and you've seen that, hopefully, in this quarter's results. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Keith Bachman from BMO. \nKeith Bachman: Brian, I wanted to actually try to get to and I'll ask them concurrently. The first is I wanted to return to bookings. And your bookings growth has been really strong. It sound like it's 15% year-to-date, and it sounded like it was 25% for the quarter, so accelerating bookings growth. And I'm trying to understand the translation of revenue, broadly speaking, for Cognizant. While bookings has been strong, is there something else that we should be thinking about on the other side on attrition, specifically of revenues outside of Facebook. \n And so normally, you would expect that to start to show up next year, but just want to make sure we understand the other side. Has there been a greater level of attrition, again, outside of Facebook, that would cause revenue growth to perhaps not show up as quickly as we might think over the course of the next year or so?\n And then the second question, Brian, is I wonder to see if you could just touch on philosophical margins. And what you mean by that, you outlined your 4 investment areas, and also the benefit associated with how the savings plan is going to manifest itself during '21. But just philosophically, is there any words that you can give, without providing specific guidance, on how investors should be thinking about margins given those puts and takes associated with '21. \nBrian Humphries: So look, let me start on the revenue question and the bookings question. There's no big story here, to be honest, outside of the exit of the nonstrategic portion of the content moderation business, which is in our operations business. Frankly, I think we're executing well, both in our -- most of our verticals, we've got more work to do in Financial Services, but even Products and Resources. We're doing well in the areas that are not consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. \n And so I just feel we have growing momentum, Keith, but I'm very cautious to commit anything because of the macro environment. The bookings is real, when I look at bookings by renewal versus expansion versus new. I just feel as though we had in the last 1.5, 2 years maybe lost a buildup of backlog and we had eroded that. And now we started replenishing what I would call them late. And now we're in a position where I'm feeling better about the future. So there's no major story there. And the more we can keep up this bookings momentum, the better because it's inevitable, then it will show up in the revenue. So we just need to keep executing.\n With regards to margins and, in some ways, revenue versus margin trade-offs, I guess, comes into mind. Look, I think about this always in 2 ways. First of all, it's important to differentiate between a cost and an investment. And secondly, growth investments will be prioritized versus short-term margin optimization. And our goal is ultimately to increase our wealth and commercial momentum and to revitalize revenue growth. And we will make some short-term margin trade-offs to achieve this. We're investing meaningfully in the business, probably even more than I anticipated a year ago. Because the more I'm here, the more I see opportunities. In talent overall, in our management -- talent management system, we're accruing bonuses at higher levels. We're getting back to merit-based promotions and raises.\n In digital, we're attracting talent, which is a constrained asset and, therefore, an expense asset. We're upgrading our client partners to be better able to represent Cognizant beyond the traditional CIO, CTO organization. The targeted M&A that we're doing, which I'm very pleased with, comes with integration costs. And while gross margins are reasonable, we do have some margin dilution on the operating income level because of the SG&A nature -- intensive nature of those businesses that we're scaling.\n And then, of course, we're continuing to build our commercial hiring. We're building our bench, which will hit our delivery costs. Investing in automation, branding, marketing. We got overall our internal systems and tools. Remediate and modernize our IT and security, and globalize our delivery network. \n So I've got plenty on my mind to find a way to continue to show margin expansion and as I said, 2020 was, in my perspective, a very challenging year from a margin perspective because of ransomware, because of COVID. I'd like to think that as we go through our restructuring program as we got more operational rigor, as we continue to work on pricing and renewals, up selling and cross-selling in our existing accounts, optimizing our pyramid, our near and offshore mix versus on our automation agenda, I'd like to think we can do what's needed in investments and yet continue to show margin expansion at a pace that is appropriate for us to continue to invest in the business.\n And for investors who are interested in that story, I think there's very 2 more compelling investments in Cognizant at this moment in time. \nOperator: In the interest of time, we have time for 1 more question from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. \nJames Friedman: I was wondering, Brian, do you have any view at this point on '21 budgets? And if that's too hard, just more generally how important do you think your client budgets are in terms of impacting Cognizant's fortunes? \nBrian Humphries: Well, it's an interesting question, James. There's many moving parts, I would say, a macro demand and on client buying behavior. So on one hand, I really feel good about our momentum today. Bookings momentum, up 15% year-to-date. I'm behind every one of those bookings, either a renewal or expansion or a new logo as a client win.\n So the first thing I'll say is macro demand is better maybe than the most pessimistic analyst suggested back in April, which is good for the entire industry. But of course, in a world of vendor consolidation, some like Cognizant will do better than others.\n Second thing is maybe against this protracted pandemic clients become increasingly decisive with their technology priorities and indeed their spend decisions, which is also good because uncertainty is the real enemy.\n Third, we are less exposed to some troubled verticals or customer segments than others. Travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods is less than 15% of our mix. We really focus on the global 2000 customer segmentation, so SMB issues are less of a concern for us.\n And fourth, we have momentum in digital. We strengthened our portfolio, and it can be a winner and will determine the next phase of digital. And I think that inflection point is real, by the way.\n On the other hand, this week's growing COVID-19 numbers and the latest restrictions, including lockdowns that were announced across Europe today, are a major cause for concern for us. And it's unclear whether this will really impact the decision-making and indeed budgets, so what has looked more promising at least in months may turn against us. So that leaves us in a situation that is challenging going into the months ahead because we have to figure out how to optimize our bench and how to reduce utilization a little and make sure we continue to get the right skills into Cognizant, but at the same time, watch demand signals and customer buying behavior like a hawk.\n With regards to customer buying behavior, look, I would say they're more decisive, as I said. They are speaking -- seeking more strategic or trusted partners to help them through the pandemic. There's some very short term or cyclical priorities. They would include all the things you would expect: remote working enablement, e-commerce, AI and analytics with a view to doing hyper-personalization activity. There's a whole set of initiatives clients are looking at to provide cost relief, CapEx reductions. And I see more and more clients look towards enhanced resiliency, security, agility and scalability. So the whole notion of cloud acceleration will continue.\n The implications of this, for sure, there's some freed-up opportunities in the short term around e-commerce and working remotely. Certainly, some larger, I would call, longer payback projects like ERP are slower, but there are some larger opportunities that have been freed up, including captives that we will look at carefully because unlike the book of business we've been acquiring through M&A, captives can be revenue catered dilutive. There are lots of vendor consolidation opportunities, which is good for us in legacy. And by the way, I would say increasingly good for us in digital because I am seeing some key -- certain suppliers or so-called digital incumbents who are perhaps less malleable or flexible than Cognizant on Ts and Cs and pricing.\n And look, there's other things happening in parallel. The pandemic is truly forcing companies to look at virtual agile and perhaps a greater consideration as to when they partner versus what they're working at. So those things are real, and I think that's impacting budgets for the coming year. As long as the situation doesn't get materially worse, the most important thing is clients are making decisions faster and they're more decisive leading into a budget cycle. If things get worse, then I think we may end up as an industry, not just in services, but beyond back in the world of pain again.\n The real trend that I'm 100% focused on, and we will put all our resources and effort behind this, relates to digital. That's a secular trend. It's strong. Our bookings are strong. Our pipeline is strong. We've got an improving brand. We see strength in digital engineering, where we're showing up very well these days. Software as a Service, AI and analytics, interactive. \n And like I said, clients, I think, are now hitting a point where they've almost reached the epiphany that they've upgraded their tech stack, but at the same time they're wondering if they're getting adequate returns from this based on everything they've spent. And so if you think about Phase 3 of digital, and think of COVID as a very, very low tide that exposes everything before the enormous tsunami wave comes in and follows, we're seeing clients realize that our platforms, our e-commerce capabilities are concrete or inadequate. Their marketing is actually more analog than digital. They kind of hyperpersonalize because of poor data hierarchies for engineering. Their processes are so people-intended that they're unscalable. \n And so in essence, even though we've gone through multiple phases of digital, what we've really been doing around the edge has been upgrading the tech stack and the infrastructure data and application layer for nondigital-native companies. And that fundamentally doesn't solve all of their problems. And clients, I think, going to this budget cycle and beyond in the years ahead, we'll become much more savvy with the fact that they need to become much more software and data-driven, they must embrace user experiences, and they ultimately must shift use cases to agile digital workflows. That's what we're focused on. That's where we're pointing our guns. And we'll participate elsewhere, but we will definitely focus on digital, and we're committed to that. \nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. \n I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. \nKatie Royce: This is Katie. Thank you all for joining and for your questions, and we'll speak to you again later in the next quarter. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Katie. \n Good afternoon, everybody, and a warm welcome to Jan, who many of you know, in what is his first Cognizant earnings call. Today, I'd like to address 4 topics with you, namely, a brief summary of the third quarter; an update on our employee engagement; observations on the demand environment and clients' evolving needs; and our strategic focus areas as we aim to revitalize revenue growth.\n Let's start with the third quarter. Third quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year in constant currency. Excluding the negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, revenue grew 60 basis points year-over-year.\n We executed well in what remains a challenging environment. Highlights of the quarter include: continued commercial momentum with bookings growth in excess of 25% year-over-year; ongoing momentum in digital with revenue growth up 13% year-over-year and continued strength in digital bookings and qualified pipeline; gross margin and cash flow strength, enabling us to continually invest in the business; and significantly increased and sustained financial flexibility on India earnings and cash. Jan will provide more insights on the quarter in his prepared remarks.\n Moving to our second topic, I would like to briefly address our talented associates. I'm grateful to each of them for their professionalism and perseverance in serving our clients during this protracted pandemic, which has put a tremendous strain on families and compressed their lives to screens and homes. We could not have executed against our commitments in 2020 without their client centricity, work ethic and engagement.\n Given our financial performance and in recognition of the contributions of our associates, we are creating 2020 bonuses at higher levels than 2019. We are also implementing targeted merit increases and promotions in the fourth quarter. Both will hurt our cost structure in 2020 versus the prior year, but are an essential and normalized part of the cost structure in the services business.\n In stressful times like these, we are especially attentive to employee engagement, a measure of how committed and connected people are to our company. Our recent Cognizant people engagement survey showed scores consistently above industry benchmarks. And our overall engagement score meaningfully increased versus prior surveys.\n In an external endorsement of sorts, Forbes Magazine just ranked Cognizant #19 out of 750 companies across 45 countries in its World's Best Employers list. These high levels of employee engagement, coupled with current economic environment, contributed to our fifth consecutive quarter of reductions in voluntary attrition. We anticipate some sequential increases in voluntary attrition in the coming quarters after the forthcoming merit-based promotions and salary increase cycle.\n We continue to prioritize the health and safety of all our associates, and remain in a work from home and restricted travel posture with only limited exceptions.\n Now I'd like to turn to clients, and in particular, the trends we are seeing. These trends fall into 2 categories, 1 cyclical and 1 secular. First, on the cyclical side and set against a protracted pandemic, clients are increasingly decisive on their technology priorities. They are focused on cost savings, CapEx reductions, resiliency and agility. This is slowing large project deployments with extended paybacks, but creating other opportunities. We are seeing accelerated vendor consolidation trends, which we stand to benefit from given our deep strategic relationships and client references in buildup rate, and our enhanced portfolio and growing reputation in digital, where more and more clients want to see us challenge digital incumbents.\n Client focus on innovation and cost savings is also creating opportunities for incumbent vendor displacement as larger deals. We plan to be disciplined and selective in our pursuit of larger deals, including captives, as these transactions, if not well conceived, can bring diluted compound annual growth rates, margin pressure and unfavorable terms.\n I want to focus my comments on the more consequential secular trend, digital transformation. This is our top priority. It goes to the heart of client business model innovation, transformation and experiences. COVID-19 has widened the digital divide between the digital natives and legacy economy companies, which have struggled to shift to a fully digital operating model. These industrial era companies have focused on upgrading their tech stack at the infrastructure, data and application layers. They have migrated their apps and data to the cloud, and improved the agility of their underlying technology. These improvements, however important, all short of delivering the full power of digital transformation as they optimize the technology foundation rather than the business process or operating model. I believe the industry is at an inflection point in digital adoption.\n We see growing client interest in realizing more immediate customer and business value by identifying use cases to shift to agile digital workflows. That means transforming processes to become agile, data-driven and automated. So workflows can be industry-specific such as claims and policy management or pharmacovigilance, or horizontal such as close to cash or digital marketing. In such cases, how we engineered an agile digital workflow for a leading app pro company that needed a return to work and to store strategy. We offered our safe workforce solution, built on the Salesforce work -- platform. This comprehensive employee safety solution provides management with information about public health conditions, office capacity employee health and shift schedules. We can stagger arrival times to minimize contract, encourage hygiene through automated reminders and when connected with IoT centers, help enforce social distancing and occupancy limits.\n As more clients implement agile digital workflows, the digital services market is evolving into a third phase. In Phase 1 of digital, clients sought to understand what digital really meant to their industries. In Phase 2, the implemented digital experiments and projects at the edge of their enterprises. In Phase 3, clients realize they must be software-driven enterprises and digital to their core.\n So what does this shift to agile digital workflows mean for services companies, and who will be the winners? The first and perhaps most obvious thing to say is that there will be more than one winner. That being said, everything we are doing as a company, from our strategy, solution portfolio, partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, branding and marketing and talent is focused on being one of the biggest beneficiaries of this new phase in digital. \n To become modern businesses and create business value, companies need to embrace a digital technology stack that consists of: personalized and engaging customer and employee experiences, enabled by software engineering, powered by customer and operational intelligence, driven by data and run on a modern cloud business platform. We haven't always done a great job marketing this, but we are one of the few firms in the world with solutions and partnerships across every layer of this stack.\n Inorganic investments have strengthened our SaaS partnerships with both Salesforce and Workday, complementing long-standing relationships with SAP, Oracle and ServiceNow to offer clients the full suite of enterprise application services they require to modernize their core processes and enable agile digital workflows. In the last 6 months, we have further strengthened our partnership commitment to all 3 leading hyperscale providers, announcing the formation of dedicated business groups for both Microsoft and AWS, and investing to enhance our Google Cloud credentials. Whatever approach a client wants to take to become a modern business, our portfolio adds multiple overlaps.\n Let's say a client wants to start at the bottom of the digital technology stack by accelerating cloud migration. We can do this for them, driving efficiencies that can subsequently be invested in innovation. And that's exactly what we're doing for a global automotive manufacturer that came to us for help to bring agility, innovation and efficiency to their business processes. We started by executing an agile delivery model for core modernization. We then deployed our one DevOps model across the clients, dealers, supply chain, accessories, parts and incentives, improving speed, flexibility and user experience.\n In another example, we're engaged in partnership with Snowflake in a digital transformation project for a leading financial services firm. We're building a cloud-based intelligent data platform that facilitates multiple analytical and machine-based use cases. This platform unlocks innovation opportunities and value-added use cases, including real-time intelligence for fraud detection, a better user experience for opening and reactivating accounts, a reduction in loan dispute processing time and improved field agent selling effectiveness.\n More and more clients are, however, starting at the top of the digital technology stack, by focusing on the customer and employee experience. Such experiences can be continuously improved through the magic of human-centric insights, software product engineering, automation and applied AI. And hyper personalization, all of which ultimately requires clients to embark on a core and data modernization journey.\n That's what we did for a large global insurance company -- Cognizant to design, implement and run a new direct-to-consumer business that will provide a compelling AI-enabled interactive experience to consumers and agents. Recognizing this needed to be integrated with existing core systems and data architectures, we then worked with AWS to host this in a scalable modern digital platform.\n In these examples, you will see the opportunity to create a flywheel effect, a virtuous cycle, which Cognizant and our clients stand well positioned to benefit from. In a world of vendor consolidation, Cognizant is one of the few firms that can capture this opportunity.\n I'd now like to turn to the company's future, and our goal to increase our relative commercial momentum and revitalized revenue growth.\n In the knowledge-based business, investing for growth starts with attracting, developing and retaining talent. In the last 6 months, we have overhauled our talent management and annual performance evaluation processes, which allow us to develop a diverse, inclusive and high-performance team, where talent is identified and nurtured for promotions. \n Meanwhile, we have invested in growth by strengthening our country leadership with senior hires in Germany, the Nordics, Australia and Asia Pacific Japan. Earlier this week, we also announced the completion of our Executive Committee with the announcement of our new President for Global Growth Markets, and the newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chairman for Cognizant India. We've also rallied the organization behind what we call the Cognizant Agenda, which articulates our purpose, vision and values. Our vision is to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite. To achieve this, we are aligned behind a series of both moves that require investments.\n First, we will meaningfully increase investments in branding and marketing including launching a breakthrough global brand campaign in the coming months. This campaign will reposition the Cognizant brand, and will reach beyond our familiar technology audience to the entire C-suite as well as the next generation of talent.\n Second, we will continue to accelerate digital. Our priority areas of digital engineering, AI and analytics, cloud and IoT are more relevant than ever to clients. We aim to lead in the third phase of digital, which will require continued investment in M&A, our commercial and delivery capabilities, offer management, talent and branding.\n Third, we will continue to globalize Cognizant by investing for growth in targeted countries, strengthening our regional capabilities, scaling our brand internationally and executing a global delivery network that will ensure greater resiliency in our delivery capabilities.\n And fourth, we will continue to make investments that increase our relevance to clients by strengthening our industry expertise and technology consulting capabilities, investing in our talent and extending our solution integrator and designer competency.\n As we invest for growth, we will also continue to leverage our balance sheet to accelerate our strategy. Our M&A strategy continues to be focused on advancing our digital priorities across the globe. Last month, we closed the acquisition of Tin Roof Software, a custom software and digital product development services company that expands our software product engineering footprint in the United States.\n And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of 10th Magnitude, one of Microsoft's longest-standing Azure-centric partners. This deal expands the Microsoft Azure expertise within our new Microsoft business group and adds development on managed services hubs throughout the United States.\n And last week, we agreed to acquire Bright Wolf, a technology services provider that specializes in custom industrial IoT solutions for Fortune 1000 companies, which will expand our smart products and Industry 4.08 expertise.\n In short, we are committed to growth, and we'll continue to make meaningful investments to ensure we increase our relevance to clients and enhance our competitiveness. While the macro and political backdrop remain uncertain, come what may, our goal is to ensure we outgrow the market, just like we did in the third quarter, whilst remaining commercially disciplined.\n In closing, I would remind you that 18 months ago, when we set Cognizant's transformation in motion aimed at returning the company to be the IT services industry bellwether, we knew this would be a multiyear endeavor, and our view has not changed. While we continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, we are encouraged by our progress. Our employees are energized united by our shared purpose and vision. We're excited about our strengthening competitive position, the opportunity to expand internationally and the opportunity presented by the third phase of digital.\n There will be several big winners in this attractive market, and we aim to be one of them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the details of the third quarter and our fiscal year outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Jason, it's Brian. So let me take a shot at this. These may be for Jan. By all means feel free to jump in if you see incremental details to add. \n So SAP as a practice, it's multiple hundred millions of dollars for us. It's sub-$1 billion. It is actually a very healthy business for us, and I have been in touch with the SAP leadership team in recent periods to see what we can do to accelerate our momentum there. It's pretty intuitive, what they're doing. But in the same way, it's also interesting for us given our ambition to scale much more internationally and given the installed base of SAP. So it's a partner that really is strategic to us, and we will continue to work closely with.\n Digital bookings. Look, more broadly, if I stand back from this. Bookings are strong overall, and it's broad-based by geography, by industry, by new and expansion versus renewals, and digital bookings are continuing to be strong as well. So what's been very pleasing to me is in the course of the last year, we have consistently shown strong bookings growth year-over-year. That has enabled us to actually build a stronger backlog through the year. And now we're in a very healthy position, healthier than we've been before. And of course, the pipeline, as Jan suggested earlier, is strong as well. Not just strong overall, but also strong in visual, in particular, and strong in the strategic accounts that we focused on as part of our customer segmentation exercise in the -- model. So I feel really good about our momentum there.\n The timing of all of this to revenue can vary by quarter, of course, and in the face of economic environment, which is unsettled to say the very least, including announcements made tonight across Europe. But we're pleased with what we've done. And if this continues, it all goes very well for our future.\n We're not going to make commentary around Q1 or indeed, fiscal year '21 at this moment in time. The only thing I'll say is we will continue to try to outgrow the industry. That's what we did this quarter. We think we're more competitive than we've been before. And we're absolutely committed to growth and to make -- investments to grow. If that means compromising some margins in the short term to achieve, we will absolutely do that. But I'm expecting performance to improve in 2021, but we'll share more details of that, of course, Q4 earnings. But the big caveat around this is what we're going through this some on time, which is a very uncertain macroeconomic environment. Lisa, Brian here. So let's start first with the headcount situation. I think our utilization levels are now quite high. We tightened our belt earlier in the year as I think every company in the world did, but we've seen somewhat of a V-shaped recovery, particularly in the digital side of our business. And as such, we're at the stage now that our bench is light, and we're committed as a leadership team to build that out. And we've already started that over the last month or so. But it takes time, of course, to get that built out.\n Obviously, we want to continue to drive more operational rigor around forecasting, which triggers enterprise resource management and all of that to make sure we have the right resources in the right place at the right time. So you will see us continue to build out our capabilities with evergreen skills or hot skills, as we would call them, and build upon our capabilities such that we can reduce utilization, which is a little bit higher at this moment in time.\n I am pleased with the employee engagement. I am pleased that voluntary attrition is down for the fifth quarter in a row. Notwithstanding that we're really pushing meritocracy and a performance culture these days. So you have seen a big bifurcation between voluntary versus involuntary attrition. And we do expect voluntary attrition to pick up a little bit in the coming quarters as we go through the merit-based promotion and salary cycle we're going through. And I underscore the word merit-based.\n With regards to H1B visas, look, it's quite topical, but perhaps I could stand hand back here a little bit and talk because the administrative rule changes with regards to skilled integration leases that have been quite topical in recent weeks. Some of those have been enjoyed through litigation already. And for other elements, there are challenges pending at this moment in time. So whether the rules, survive or not remains to be seen.\n All that being said, I actually think all roads are leading this direction anyway. So we will always intend to comply with the letter of the law to use these applications and any extensions we intend to pursue.\n We are a H1B visa, I would say, dependent organization. You used the word evolution, and I think that's the right word. Over the years, we have reduced our dependency in visas, and we've also acquired companies that enable us to be more global in nature. But in the same vein, some of the strategic decisions we took, which were in the right decisions, including exiting a portion of content moderation, has put us back a little bit. That being said, the rule is solely triggered by new applications and extensions. And H1B visas are currently under a 3-year visa. So this will roll in gradually. And I would say, I don't want to reassure everybody, our intention is to globalize Cognizant. And so you'll see us build out much more of a global-based workforce to meet client expectations, whilst, of course, stay focused on quality of delivery.\n And that will include a whole host of things that we will do, including U.S. college campus recruiting, upskilling and just a broader effort around a local employee base in the U.S. and indeed globally. So Jan, I'll touch on the health care business. If you want to touch upon then the cash flow and the cash balance and the Syntel settlement, which we were pleased to see yesterday. So Ashwin, first of all, health care is really important to us. It's almost 30% of the total company, and it consists of 2 major portions. One is life sciences. We're doing really well there. We have been for a long time. It's highly strategic to us. You are seeing the lapping of Zenith technology, which happened in Q3 of 2020. So that will impact growth rates a little bit. \n But I'm very optimistic around the opportunities in life sciences at the intersection point of biopharma medical devices. Right through to industry 4.0 health care, retail and indeed health tech. And I spent a number of hours on that with the team over the weekend. So we're really pumped around what we can do there, and you will see us continue to invest in it.\n The majority of the businesses, however, the U.S. health care business, which is split between payer and providers. The payer business accelerated meaningfully this quarter, which strengthened services and indeed in products. We have a new leader who took over the Healthcare business earlier this year, an internal promotion, who has done a fantastic job, and this entire team are doing great for us. Bookings are very strong. Product growth is strong. We're getting new logos. Margins are improving. And we're just generally feeling very good, a better payer business.\n The provider business, which is much smaller than our payer business, saw significant erosion year-over-year in the third quarter as did the industry. As you know, the provider business is suffering from transaction volumes that are decreasing because the pandemic is obviously reducing elective procedures. And I would say that's an area that we would expect to come back but more holistically, the momentum we're seeing in payers, which is 3/4 of the business, and life sciences will give us confidence that we can continue to pull strong health care results going forward. We're improving. Jan, over to you. Bryan, so I would say, yes, it remains challenged. Look, first of all, just like health care, financial services, so the greatest impact from ransomware. But the Financial Services results, I'd almost cut them into 2 portions of discussion. First of all, insurance -- and as you know, the insurance industry has really been pressured, to say the very late in the last year, both at a pandemic level, insurance rebates and automobiles, SMB businesses, interrupted failures. That's impacting the property as of the insurance entry. And of course, mortality rates of life carriers. And then on top of that to make matters worse, catastrophic events and low interest rates. So that sector is under pressure.\n Our business is, let's say, 80% of our insurance business is in North America, so a little bit more than the average company. It's one of our strongest franchises, but it will decline in this year, in 2020. So we need to turn it around. We need to improve the pipeline. To be very honest, booking have been strong, but the pipeline isn't strong enough. Our leader has retired in the last month or so, so we have some new energy in there. And hopefully, we can get that back on track.\n Banking. Look, if I paint the macro picture first. As we've implied in the prepared remarks, capital markets, retail and commercial banking grew year-over-year. Cards or payments were down. With regards to some of the larger global banking clients that you referenced, it's more of a handful. Some of that, to be very honest, relates to ransomware we were turning some around. Some is self-inflicted wounds related to a lack of appropriate senior origin in the client partners we had. And some of it relates to secular pressure towards in-sourcing that we're seeing at those banks.\n Now what do we do to turn all around this entire situation. I'm confident we'll get insurance back on track. I think we'll also continue to make progress in the North America regional banks. And we've even brought some accounts into platinum account status this quarter, i.e., they surpassed $100 million. But in the same vein, we have a lot of work to do in our current accounts, and that includes scaling more into digital in those banks. The good news is our digital bookings in those banks are up in excess of 50%. So we are starting to get our foot in the door. We continue to upgrade our client partners, and we're continuing to try to do a much more sophisticated job in terms of account planning.\n In the same vein, right up to the executive committee, me included, we are trying to break into some of the other large banks. And I think we're making progress actually on 2 in particular. So hopefully, we'll have some good news on that in the foreseeable future.\n Europe and banking just remains weak. We lost an account there in the last year, and we have some transformation project issues and 1 large account over there. It is fixable, but I just don't see the momentum turning around there as quickly in banking overall, as I have seen in health care. Thanks, Rod. Brian here. So look there's a short answer and there's a long answer, so I'm going to give you something in between. First of all, I really feel good about the progress we've made in the last 18 months. We've actually done a lot, probably more than people realize. Clarified our strategy. We executed the nonstrategic portion of the business. We executed a restructuring program. We used some of the proceeds from that to reinvest back in the business. We meaningfully improved our digital portfolio competencies and partnerships. We've built a strong professional, mature, client-centric leadership team. We've begun a pretty significant commercial transformation that is showing positive leading indicators and pipeline win rates, bookings. And we put, I would say, a better business management system in place to ensure optimal financial and operational rigor. And we did all of that, to be very honest, in a period that I was not expecting. \n We managed through global pandemics that impacted both demand as well as fulfillment. We navigated a ransomware attack well, and I want to say that humbly. But we did as best as we could, and we've actually received good client feedback on that. We've improved employee engagement to levels not seen for a few years, and that reduced voluntary attrition at 5 quarters in a row. And we've managed to put ourselves in a position that we built a multiyear plan that incorporates sustained investments.\n So I'd characterize all of that as pleased, but not satisfied, to be very honest. We're not in finish product yet. We're in the middle of a multiyear project. And we must continue to, of course, as we've said, reposition the brand, execute our strategy, globalize the company, take advantage of the opportunity overseas, globalize our delivery, build on our growing momentum in health care, and fix financial services and, of course, accelerate our position in digital, which just simply exposes us to higher categories of growth and makes us more relevant to clients.\n If we do all of this, our bookings momentum will continue, and ultimately, this will translate to revenue growth. And so Rod, everything else at some stage becomes a leading indicator: pipeline, win rates, the leadership team, the bookings. Our goal here is to invest in the business to get back to growth. If we do that, growth accelerates and we will show margin expansion but in a very calculated manner that allows us to sustainably reinvest back into the business. I say all of this with a great deal of caveats given the uncertain macroeconomic situation we're in at this moment in time. \n That being said, I'll just wrap up by saying, I'm really proud of our team and of our associates around the world. I'm confident of the unity of our leadership team, the absolute support of our Board of Directors who've been tremendously supportive of what we're doing, and our growing execution rigor. And honestly, I think we're on track. We're increasingly competitive, and you've seen that, hopefully, in this quarter's results. So look, let me start on the revenue question and the bookings question. There's no big story here, to be honest, outside of the exit of the nonstrategic portion of the content moderation business, which is in our operations business. Frankly, I think we're executing well, both in our -- most of our verticals, we've got more work to do in Financial Services, but even Products and Resources. We're doing well in the areas that are not consumer goods, and travel and hospitality. \n And so I just feel we have growing momentum, Keith, but I'm very cautious to commit anything because of the macro environment. The bookings is real, when I look at bookings by renewal versus expansion versus new. I just feel as though we had in the last 1.5, 2 years maybe lost a buildup of backlog and we had eroded that. And now we started replenishing what I would call them late. And now we're in a position where I'm feeling better about the future. So there's no major story there. And the more we can keep up this bookings momentum, the better because it's inevitable, then it will show up in the revenue. So we just need to keep executing.\n With regards to margins and, in some ways, revenue versus margin trade-offs, I guess, comes into mind. Look, I think about this always in 2 ways. First of all, it's important to differentiate between a cost and an investment. And secondly, growth investments will be prioritized versus short-term margin optimization. And our goal is ultimately to increase our wealth and commercial momentum and to revitalize revenue growth. And we will make some short-term margin trade-offs to achieve this. We're investing meaningfully in the business, probably even more than I anticipated a year ago. Because the more I'm here, the more I see opportunities. In talent overall, in our management -- talent management system, we're accruing bonuses at higher levels. We're getting back to merit-based promotions and raises.\n In digital, we're attracting talent, which is a constrained asset and, therefore, an expense asset. We're upgrading our client partners to be better able to represent Cognizant beyond the traditional CIO, CTO organization. The targeted M&A that we're doing, which I'm very pleased with, comes with integration costs. And while gross margins are reasonable, we do have some margin dilution on the operating income level because of the SG&A nature -- intensive nature of those businesses that we're scaling.\n And then, of course, we're continuing to build our commercial hiring. We're building our bench, which will hit our delivery costs. Investing in automation, branding, marketing. We got overall our internal systems and tools. Remediate and modernize our IT and security, and globalize our delivery network. \n So I've got plenty on my mind to find a way to continue to show margin expansion and as I said, 2020 was, in my perspective, a very challenging year from a margin perspective because of ransomware, because of COVID. I'd like to think that as we go through our restructuring program as we got more operational rigor, as we continue to work on pricing and renewals, up selling and cross-selling in our existing accounts, optimizing our pyramid, our near and offshore mix versus on our automation agenda, I'd like to think we can do what's needed in investments and yet continue to show margin expansion at a pace that is appropriate for us to continue to invest in the business.\n And for investors who are interested in that story, I think there's very 2 more compelling investments in Cognizant at this moment in time. Well, it's an interesting question, James. There's many moving parts, I would say, a macro demand and on client buying behavior. So on one hand, I really feel good about our momentum today. Bookings momentum, up 15% year-to-date. I'm behind every one of those bookings, either a renewal or expansion or a new logo as a client win.\n So the first thing I'll say is macro demand is better maybe than the most pessimistic analyst suggested back in April, which is good for the entire industry. But of course, in a world of vendor consolidation, some like Cognizant will do better than others.\n Second thing is maybe against this protracted pandemic clients become increasingly decisive with their technology priorities and indeed their spend decisions, which is also good because uncertainty is the real enemy.\n Third, we are less exposed to some troubled verticals or customer segments than others. Travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods is less than 15% of our mix. We really focus on the global 2000 customer segmentation, so SMB issues are less of a concern for us.\n And fourth, we have momentum in digital. We strengthened our portfolio, and it can be a winner and will determine the next phase of digital. And I think that inflection point is real, by the way.\n On the other hand, this week's growing COVID-19 numbers and the latest restrictions, including lockdowns that were announced across Europe today, are a major cause for concern for us. And it's unclear whether this will really impact the decision-making and indeed budgets, so what has looked more promising at least in months may turn against us. So that leaves us in a situation that is challenging going into the months ahead because we have to figure out how to optimize our bench and how to reduce utilization a little and make sure we continue to get the right skills into Cognizant, but at the same time, watch demand signals and customer buying behavior like a hawk.\n With regards to customer buying behavior, look, I would say they're more decisive, as I said. They are speaking -- seeking more strategic or trusted partners to help them through the pandemic. There's some very short term or cyclical priorities. They would include all the things you would expect: remote working enablement, e-commerce, AI and analytics with a view to doing hyper-personalization activity. There's a whole set of initiatives clients are looking at to provide cost relief, CapEx reductions. And I see more and more clients look towards enhanced resiliency, security, agility and scalability. So the whole notion of cloud acceleration will continue.\n The implications of this, for sure, there's some freed-up opportunities in the short term around e-commerce and working remotely. Certainly, some larger, I would call, longer payback projects like ERP are slower, but there are some larger opportunities that have been freed up, including captives that we will look at carefully because unlike the book of business we've been acquiring through M&A, captives can be revenue catered dilutive. There are lots of vendor consolidation opportunities, which is good for us in legacy. And by the way, I would say increasingly good for us in digital because I am seeing some key -- certain suppliers or so-called digital incumbents who are perhaps less malleable or flexible than Cognizant on Ts and Cs and pricing.\n And look, there's other things happening in parallel. The pandemic is truly forcing companies to look at virtual agile and perhaps a greater consideration as to when they partner versus what they're working at. So those things are real, and I think that's impacting budgets for the coming year. As long as the situation doesn't get materially worse, the most important thing is clients are making decisions faster and they're more decisive leading into a budget cycle. If things get worse, then I think we may end up as an industry, not just in services, but beyond back in the world of pain again.\n The real trend that I'm 100% focused on, and we will put all our resources and effort behind this, relates to digital. That's a secular trend. It's strong. Our bookings are strong. Our pipeline is strong. We've got an improving brand. We see strength in digital engineering, where we're showing up very well these days. Software as a Service, AI and analytics, interactive. \n And like I said, clients, I think, are now hitting a point where they've almost reached the epiphany that they've upgraded their tech stack, but at the same time they're wondering if they're getting adequate returns from this based on everything they've spent. And so if you think about Phase 3 of digital, and think of COVID as a very, very low tide that exposes everything before the enormous tsunami wave comes in and follows, we're seeing clients realize that our platforms, our e-commerce capabilities are concrete or inadequate. Their marketing is actually more analog than digital. They kind of hyperpersonalize because of poor data hierarchies for engineering. Their processes are so people-intended that they're unscalable. \n And so in essence, even though we've gone through multiple phases of digital, what we've really been doing around the edge has been upgrading the tech stack and the infrastructure data and application layer for nondigital-native companies. And that fundamentally doesn't solve all of their problems. And clients, I think, going to this budget cycle and beyond in the years ahead, we'll become much more savvy with the fact that they need to become much more software and data-driven, they must embrace user experiences, and they ultimately must shift use cases to agile digital workflows. That's what we're focused on. That's where we're pointing our guns. And we'll participate elsewhere, but we will definitely focus on digital, and we're committed to that."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. \n I'm very happy to be part of the Cognizant team and look forward to connecting with all of you going forward. From the onset, I was intrigued by Cognizant's meaningful growth opportunity, and my first weeks in the job have more than confirmed my initial assessment. I will work hard to fill Karen's shoes and wanted to say a big thank you to her for making my onboard so smooth and seamless.\n Moving on to Q3 results. Third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was flat year-over-year or a decline of 70 basis points at constant currency. Compared to the prior year period, this includes a positive 250 basis points contribution from inorganic growth and a negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain content-related services. Sequentially, we saw a broad-based improvement in the business, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IoT and software engineering.\n Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 2.2% with similar performance in both banking and insurance. Retail banking improved in the quarter, driven by regional banks, while capital markets returned to growth after several quarters of softness. However, we continue to see weakness across global banking accounts and with clients in the payment sector. We continue to expect below company average performance in the Financial Services segment for the next several quarters.\n Healthcare grew 4.2% led by double-digit growth in life sciences, driven by strong growth in the biopharma clients, and included the contribution of the Zenith acquisition which we lapped mid quarter. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness in the medical device clients.\n Within our health care vertical, revenue saw modest growth. After 6 quarters of decline, we are pleased with early signs of improvements in the health care business, we see improvement in the payer segment across key accounts which is offsetting the decline in the provider market that continues to be negatively impacted by COVID.\n Products and Resources declined 4.6%, with double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and high single-digit declines in retail and consumer goods. While we saw strength in bookings in retail and consumer goods, we expect continued pressure in 2021 as a result of the ongoing pandemic.\n Communications, Media and Technology was flat, including the approximately negative $57 million year-over-year impact to technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. Excluding this negative 920 basis point impact, growth in Communications, Media and Technology was approximately 9%. Communications and media grew mid-single digits as growth in communications and education clients offset continued weakness in media and entertainment. We expect pressure in media and entertainment into 2021.\n While overall, we saw improved momentum across the business, the demand environment remains uncertain. But we believe we are gaining traction across industries as reflected in the strong bookings and pipeline numbers Brian referenced earlier.\n Moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 14.2% and $0.64, respectively. GAAP EPS reflects $140 million or $0.20 -- $0.26 per share income tax expense related to the reversal of our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings. I'll comment more on that decision later in my prepared remarks.\n Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.9%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.97. Adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by higher incentive-based compensation and the dilutive impact of our recently completed acquisitions, which more than offset savings from our Fit for Growth program, lower T&E expense and the favorable movement in the rupee. Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred $43 million of charges related to the Fit for Growth Plan. The actions drove continued cost discipline, which allowed us to further invest into our growth initiatives. The majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete, and we have achieved our savings targets. \n We expect charges to be approximately $200 million in annualized gross run rate savings of $520 million to $550 million in 2021.\n While we don't anticipate charges under Fit for Growth to continue in 2021, we will continue to invest savings achieved to help accelerated growth aligned behind the 4 strategic areas Brian outlined: repositioning the Cognizant brand, accelerating digital, globalizing the company, increasing our relevance with clients.\n Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of September 30, stood at $4.6 billion or a net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net debt balances include the approximate $1.7 billion drawn on our revolving credit facilities in the first quarter 2020. We had a strong cash flow quarter generating $821 million of free cash flow, largely driven by improved collections of our receivables. DSO improved 5 days year-over-year to 72 days.\n Before turning to guidance, I will provide additional details on our decision to reverse our indefinite reinvestment assertion on accumulated India earnings totaling $5.2 billion. The decision was made based on our strategic priorities to accelerate growth in international markets, and to expand our global delivery footprint, changes to the India budget enacted in April, and changes to the U.S. tax regulations that became effective in September. This reversal resulted in a onetime GAAP-only tax cost of approximately $140 million, and makes those earnings available globally.\n In October, we distributed $2.1 billion from our subsidiary in India, which resulted in a net $2 billion cash transfer from India after payment of India withholding tax.\n Importantly, on a go-forward basis, we can now more efficiently utilize 100% of free cash flow globally, which gives us greater flexibility in our ongoing capital allocation program. While we are reviewing our capital allocation plan, we initiated our share repurchase program, and intend to repay our credit facilities by the end of this month. The share repurchase activity will offset a portion of the EPS impact from the lost interest income historically generated from cash balances held in India. While interest rates in India have steadily declined in the last several quarters, year-to-date, that cash had earned roughly 5%. This generated approximately $95 million of interest income or $0.13 per share. Since September, we have deployed over $700 million on share buybacks, repurchasing approximately 10 million shares.\n Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. While we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline of the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely be impacted by the pace of economic recovery and thus, clients' confidence and spend. We are reaffirming revenue guidance at the high end of our previously guided range.\n Specifically, for the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline approximately 0.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rate, this translates to a decline of 0.5% up to approximately $16.7 billion on a reported basis.\n Our revenue guidance includes our estimate of the negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to the full year revenue from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business that will be reflected in our CMT segment and a positive contribution of approximately 200 basis points from closed acquisitions.\n This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for Financial Services, and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portions of our Products and Resources segment.\n For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental costs associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1, and incentive compensation above 2019 levels.\n Our current guidance also assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and the typical cycle of furloughs.\n We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.63 to $3.67. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations in the 8-K we filed today for a full definition. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 541 million shares and GAAP tax rate of approximately 32%, which implies a Q4 tax rate of approximately 27%. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to the immigration and tax policies. \n With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Yes. Let me add a few comments to the Syntel lawsuit. You may have seen this morning that we won a jury verdict of $854 million. This lawsuit has a long history for Cognizant. And at the core is our claim that Syntel misappropriated TriZetto's intellectual property related to some software products during that time and -- while Syntel was a TriZetto subcontractor. And the jury verdict, which found no liability for TriZetto or Cognizant, basically speaks for itself. We're gratified with the results. But at Atos, the owner of Syntel, has already indicated that they're planning to appeal the verdict. So it will be quite a bit out, I think, until we have the final results of this trial coming, too. So way too early to take that cash into account for any actions. Nevertheless, I think it was satisfying to see the jury decide with Cognizant's position. \n Relative to the cash repatriation, it might be worthwhile just spending an extra minute on it, too. So we had about a cash balance in India of $2.1 billion. And we -- at the end of September, reversed our indefinite reinvestment assertion and decided to repatriate that cash from India. And as part of that decision, we could make that decision for 2 reasons. \n The most important one is strategically driven actually because we are executing well on our strategy to globalize the enterprise, and we'll continue to invest into international markets. And for that, capital will be needed. But number two, also, the '21 -- fiscal year '21 India budget enacted in April and some changes in U.S. tax regulations allowed us to remediate this cash on a cost-effective basis, and we did so actually in October.\n The cash balances in India historically have earned some interest on the cash balances -- on the cash that we have there. And approximately, I think, as I said in the script, about 5%. And the -- we offsetting -- we used some of the cash that we returned from India and cash at hand to repurchase shares during the month of September and October. And the accretion created to the share buybacks is actually approximately offsetting the contribution that our interest income would have generated in India. So the outlook is quite balanced as a starting point. And obviously, we're excited about the go-forward benefit of this transaction because we, going forward, have now full flexibility and full access to our free cash flow on a global basis."

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody. Today I'd like to cover four topics with you including, a summary of our second quarter performance, an update on our purpose, vision and strategy, some thought on the macro demand environments and evolving client needs and an update on our efforts to ensure the highest levels of resiliency to our clients. Before I proceed with our second quarter earnings call, I would like to add some commentary to today's announcement that Karen McLoughlin has decided to retire from Cognizant after more than eight years as Chief Financial Officer and an incredibly successful career in the company spanning almost 70 years. During this time Karen's role in helping Cognizant become one of the world's leading professional services companies cannot be overstated. It's been a privilege to work with Karen over the past 16 months and I am forever indebted for her assistance and leadership. Karen, on behalf of the entire Cognizant family, I'd like to thank you for your many contributions to Cognizant. You\u2019ve done a fantastic job and can be proud of your accomplishments. We wish you nothing, but success in your future endeavors. We are excited to welcome Jan Siegmund to Cognizant. Jan has been accomplished executive with a wealth of experience in finance, strategy and general management. Jan will join us in the CFO role on September 01, 2020. Karen will continue in her capacity as CFO through August 31st and then remain with us in an advisory role through December 31, 2020, thereby ensuring a smooth CFO transition. Most recent Jan served as Chief Financial Officer of ADP, a role which he held for seven years. It follow that many of you will recognize his name and will experiencing engaging with Jan in the past. You'll understand therefore why is the right choice to be our next CFO and why I look forward to working alongside him. Now let's go back to our earnings, I'm pleased with our second quarter performance. Faced with the unprecedented challenges of global pandemic and the ransomware attack that impacted our operations, we executed well. We stay true to our digital strategy and fulfilled the responsibilities to our multiple stakeholders, including our associates, our clients, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Second quarter revenue was $4 million, a decline of 2.5% year-over-year in constant currency. And this included a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, which we announced in Q3 2019. We have now fully exited this subset of services. Our associates are the true heroes of the quarter not just in my eyes, but also the eyes of our clients who are at the center of everything we do. Associates around the world quickly adopted to work from home conditions, staying productive and help our client successfully navigate the initial shock of the pandemic and when we became the victim of a ransomware attack in April, their instinctive client-centricity kicked in. We intentionally ensured that we were highly visible, transparent and cooperative with clients who recognize our perseverance and professionalism and how hard we work to ensure their mission-critical services were uninterrupted. Therefore, I want to thank our leadership team and all our associates throughout the world for their dedication to our clients and their contribution to our performance in the quarter. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. We communicate regularly and transparently with them and have equipped them for virtual working and rewarded a large portion of our associate base with a 25% salary increase payment for the month of April to recognize their extraordinary continuity of services efforts. People are the heart of our business, so employee engagement is therefore critical and I'm pleased to report that our recent annual companywide people engagement survey shows that our engagement scores are up across all major categories. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter, but I wanted to emphasize two salient points. First, we are gaining commercial momentum. This is illustrated by our bookings trends, which grew 40% year-over-year in the first half of 2020 notwithstanding the challenges we face in the quarter. North America, which grew 25% plus in the first half is particularly strong. This was offset by declines in global growth markets given the signature of the Samlink agreement in Q2 2019. Excluding the impact of Samlink, total company booking grew 25% plus in the first half 2020 and global growth market bookings grew in the mid teens. Our bookings momentum is broad-based across our service lines and industries. Bookings accelerated through Q2 with June being an exceptional month. Moreover leading indicators are strong with qualified pipeline up double digits year-over-year and win rates continue to be solid. Second, we are making noteworthy progress in digital. In the second quarter, revenue in digital grew 14% year-over-year and now represents 42% of our digital -- of our company revenue mix. First half 2020 digital bookings growth of almost 50% was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive and software as a service. I'm confident that our digital momentum will continue given the strength of leading indicators. Clients are also highly receptive to Cognizant's digital capabilities given not just our strong portfolio and strong customer satisfaction, but also their desire to see us challenge digital incumbents, importantly, it's becomes the virtual circle as the greater our digital mix, the greater our overall company growth prospects. This takes me to second topic, which is about purpose and vision and their connection to engagement values and our strategy. The executive leadership team and I have given a great deal of thought to how we optimize the engagement we get from our 280,000 person knowledge business, which spans multigenerational and a diverse workforce. In recent months, we set out to develop and communicate a purpose and vision statement, as well as reviewing the values that establish how we work. We believe this is an important and it's part of our long-term success and we will be rolling out what we're calling the Cognizant agenda to the entire company in August. It's worth taking a moment to run through the key elements of this. We define Cognizant's purpose this way. We engineer modern businesses to improve everyday life. This statement explains why we're in business and serves as our inspirational North Star and driving force. Our purpose also conveyed that while we are B2B company, the work we do with and for our clients helps improve the lives of billions of people. Most important, it rings true with our culture as evidenced by how well we dealt with the unprecedented challenges of recent months. To measure how well we're living our purpose and clarify what we aspire to achieve, we set out a vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the global 2000 C-suite. This is where our strategy comes into play as we aim to execute a series of bold moves to realize our vision and these actions call for us to accelerate digital, optimize our core business, transform our commercial model, supercharge our talents and enhance our reputation. Accelerating digital is at the heart of our strategy and I have two fundamental beliefs on this topic. First, we are still in the early stages of digital and the COVID-19 pandemic is single-handedly significantly accelerating the shift to digital and second, Cognizant is a global scale portfolio and strategic client relationships to be one of the single biggest beneficiaries of the shift in the coming years. Put simply, digital creates an enormous opportunity for Cognizant and we intend to capture this. While the industry has been talking about digital transformation for years, many companies have yet make the transition to a fully digital operating model instead digitizing only select operations. In a matter of months, COVID-19 has exposed the extent of the digital divide between digital natives and traditional companies. Migrating infrastructure application and data states to a more flexible resilient and cost-effective cloud architecture to the start with in itself insufficient. Clients are increasingly shifting their focus to modernizing their core processes to be truly agile so that they can continually improve the value proposition and experience the offer to their customers and employees and our strategy is built on our ability to leverage our strength in the applications and data management service layers. To enable agile workflows to our clients, can deliver customer and business value simultaneously. We fully execute this strategy. We withdrawn our broad portfolio and a rich heritage of delivery excellence, partly with our clients to deliver business outcomes with innovative solutions that leverage our internal capabilities and those of our partner ecosystem. Winning in digital requires a broad ecosystem of partners and therefore, as cloud computing has changed the way IT has delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms. We have meaningfully increased our partnership focus and investments with all three leading hyperscale companies and our most strategic software as a service partners. We've complemented organic investments with a targeted M&A strategy focused 100% on digital. Earlier in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions expands our opportunity in cloud by establishing a new practice in its large fast growing market. It also differentiates us in particular against offshore competitors. Yesterday we announced our fifth cloud-related acquisition of the past year, New Signature, one of the world's largest independent Microsoft public cloud transformation specialist that serves all three Microsoft clouds. This will provide a foundation for a dedicated Microsoft business group within Cognizant. Underscoring our success in executing our strategy, we were recently named the 2020 Microsoft Partner of the Year for SAP on Azure as well as the leader in Gartner's 2020 magic quadrant portfolio infrastructure professional and managed services worldwide. Let's turn now to the demand environment and I'll start with some positive news. First, micro demand although still uncertain in better that we anticipated in April. Second, revenue growth in bookings momentum improved through the second quarter. Third, we remain confident that our digital, clients, industry and geographic revenue mix positions us favorably and fourth, clients are consolidating vendors as they seek more strategic partners to help them through the implications of COVID-19. This is favorable for Cognizant. In fact, we are increasingly seen as a strategic partner, not just in the run-off rate but also in digital. We are nonetheless cautious about macro demand environment, while the fiscal stimulus has helped, higher unemployment rates remain a concern, COVID-19 cases were on the rise in many states and countries and many of the seats with executives I speak with, are breaking for a period of prolonged economic disruption. Therefore, the footpath forward may be one of continued caution. This means continued rigor on discretionary spending, the protection of key skills and targeted investments for growth. So what does the future hold? We believe the implications of the pandemic will be broad and lasting. The nature of work in our society will change across many dimensions, including how we interact, communicate, embrace technology and think about risk. The practical limitations of business are consequential and go well beyond the return to office timelines, business continuity planning, the question of the shift to virtual agile or questions about the future of business travel or commercial real estate policies, both of which I believe will be changed forever. I think of clients and prospects every single day and many seems to be moving through three broad stages. First, the commitments to keep their employees safe and their business is running without interruption. Second, an adoption phase to the new normal, which includes the considerable technological and human implications of working from anywhere and third, the need to truly embrace digital to stay competitive. This requires them to fully modernized their businesses across infrastructure, data and applications. There is an increasing recognition that we were in a mobile virtual and personal era for clients and employees expect always on an ubiquitous consumer grade software experiences with rich visualization tools, data integration and data protection. These needs are reflected in changing client needs and buying behavior. We see clients embrace agile development and platforms of micro services that foster innovation, unlock the power of data and offer efficiency, security, scalability and agility. This requirement aligns directly with our strategy to win in digital including cloud, AI and analytics, digital engineering and IoT. To help clients grapple with the changes brought by COVID-19, we've also developed capabilities to help them prosper in the post-COVID world. These offerings which span our portfolio includes the following. Virtual workplace an enterprise-level solution that helps companies achieve resilience and maintain productivity even in massive disruption. Data modernization, which helps clients fix how they source, interpret and consume information through flexible data structures and a modern data and analytics platform and Cognizant safe buildings, which combines layered prevention controls with instrumentation, data analytics and digital technologies to help make building safe for occupancy by providing robust monitoring and visualization capabilities. Recognize too that COVID-19 coincided with a period of societal turmoil amid significant questions about racial justice, globalization and corporate social responsibility to not only our clients businesses and technological requirements changing, but so too are the demands of their vendors and people underscore our intensified commitment to social responsibility. Cognizant and its foundations have a long history of contributing to the health, well-being, education and progress of the communities in which we live and work. In April, for example we announced an initial 10 million philanthropic commitment to support communities around the world in addressing COVID-19's immediate and long-term impacts. In June, the Cognizant US foundation announced a $5 million commitment to communities of color, the continuation of its long-standing work to advance education, training and career pathways for underrepresented populations across the US. And in late 2019, as we announced our decision to exit a subset of content moderation, we allocated $5 million to fund research aimed at reducing users exposure to objectionable content. We're also proud to support global work to remediate COVID-19. More than 100,000 researchers and clinicians are now using our shared investigator platform, a life sciences software-as-a-service solution and some of their work is focused on accelerating the development of COVID-19 therapies through virtual clinical trial processes. We're also providing a team of our life sciences experts to support Verily, the health and life sciences company of Alphabet, with it's baseline of COVID-19 testing program to increase individual access to scheduling. In the wake of the unprecedented clean challenges of COVID-19 and an ransomware attack, we like many of our clients are increasingly focused on improving our business resiliency, especially within our delivery and technology organizations. Let me first address delivery. While I'm extremely proud of our delivery team, and how well they enable the safety of our associates and continuity of mission-critical services for our clients, the pandemic highlighted the need to increase the robustness and resiliency of our delivery operations. We are taking a fresh look at our delivery organization and defining a next-generation delivery model that will extend the work we've done in recent years to further globalize our network of delivery centers across the globe, which will complement our India hub. This will ensure greater resiliency, enable us to better service our client's needs for scrum teams nearshore and onshore and give us greater access to global talent. Automation will of course be pervasive to grab. And on the point of technology, I've appointed a new head of technology and strategy who will report directly to me and focus on informing our strategy, digitizing our business and strengthening our IT and security capabilities. Their first priority when they start next week on August 3, will be to complete our IT and securities remediation efforts. We've devoted substantial time and resources toward remediation and as a result have made significant progress in recent months. Not only have we essentially completely contained and eradicated ransomware, we've also begun what we expect will be a multi-quarter initiative to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. A subcommittee of the Board of Directors will help me provide oversight of these efforts, which is being conducted in conjunction with external security experts. In closing for several quarters I've been speaking with you about our multiyear effort to reposition Cognizant to achieve its full growth potential, as we execute the initiatives of the transformation office. We've not let COVID-19 or ransomware distract us from his work and we've made steady progress across many dimensions, including accelerating our digital strategy, globalizing Cognizant and increasing our relevance to clients. These teams require ongoing investments including our portfolio of brands, our talent and our partnerships. While more work is needed in the quarters ahead, I am confident about Cognizant's growing stature and our competitive position. We're controlling what we can control, making progress in our competitiveness relative to peers and positioning ourselves for commercial momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen and will now take you through the details of the quarter and our outlook before going to questions and answers. Karen, over to you.\nKaren McLoughlin: Thank you, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start with my prepared remarks I'd like to take a moment to say that my 17 years at Cognizant have been more rewarding than I could have ever imagined. During my eight years as CFO, we have grown from 138,000 associate and about $6.1 billion in annual revenue to over 280,000 associate and over $16 billion in annual revenue today and I'm very proud of our achievements along the way. I've been honored and privileged to work alongside our associates around the world with passion and commitment to our client, our colleagues and our community never ceases to amaze me. This is a very special company with a wonderful future. I am so pleased to pass the baton to Jan Siegmund, who, as many of you know is a very accomplished executive. I am confident Jan will do a wonderful job working alongside Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team to lead the company forward. In the meantime, I look forward to working with Jan, Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Now let me turn to our results. Second quarter revenue of $4 billion declined 3.4% year-over-year or 2.5% in constant currency including a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content related services and a negative 90 basis points from the ransomware attack impact on fulfillment, the latter which was skewed towards our financial services and healthcare segment. After working through COVID-19 related fulfillment challenges early in the quarter, we saw improved momentum in May and June driven by double-digit growth in our digital service offerings, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IT modernization and digital engineering. Moving to the industry verticals, we're all of the growth rate provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 4.3% with softness in both banking and insurance. We continue to see weakness across global banking accounts. Capital markets which is roughly 40% of total banking revenue continues to be under the most pressure and additionally, the macro backdrop has negatively impacted client in the payment sector, particularly those with significant exposure to travel and hospitality volume. Healthcare grew 2.2% led by strong double-digit growth in life sciences in Europe primarily driven by the Zenith Technologies acquisition. Within our healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digit. I want to highlight that the leading indicators of our healthcare business including software license sales, new logos, qualified pipeline and booking are significantly better than one year ago. Products and resources declined 5% with double digit growth in manufacturing, logic logistics, energy and utilities offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods where we expect continued pressure in the second half of the year as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In manufacturing and logistics, we are expanding our wallet share with our largest accounts and saw an uptick in deal wins leveraging our strengthened partnerships with both cloud and SaaS providers. Communications, media and technology declined 3.2% including the approximately negative $48 million impact of technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business where the vast majority of our work has now ramped down. Excluding this negative 790 basis points impact, we saw approximately 5% growth in communications, media and technology. Performance was flat in communications and media as growth of certain communications client was offset by a weakness with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks. We expect continued pressure in media and entertainment in the second half of the year. Overall the demand environment in the second half remains uncertain, but we believe that we are gaining competitiveness across industries. As Brian mentioned, booking and pipeline are solid and we've made progress strengthening our partnerships. Here are a few examples of how we are working with our strategic technology partners. A client in the tollroad operator business had legacy systems located in primary and backup data centers just a mile apart from each other jeopardizing resiliency. The client was also experiencing the liability and performance issues with its commercial back office and CRM business applications. We migrated there on-prim back office, external website and all databases to AWS in just two months, streamlining all customer interactions. We are now building the new back office on an open source serverless architecture, enabling annual savings of up to 40% in infrastructure operational costs. And with Verizon's ThingSpace IoT platform now integrated with Microsoft Azure, Cognizant is the first company to leverage the combined solution platform to develop its own IoT-enabled application on cold chain to support pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries impacted by the pandemic. Temperature sensitive products can now be monitored to ensure product integrity from shipping through to the consumer and Cognizant and Google Cloud are already working with financial services organizations to modernize legacy platforms and digitally transform core banking. For multiple banks we're running core banking solutions based on Temenos technology with Google Cloud. Moving on to margins, in Q2 our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 11.7% and $0.67 respectively. Adjusted operating margins, which excludes restructuring and COVID related charges of 14.1% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82. COVID-related charges were $25 million in the quarter primarily related to the previously announced one-time salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines. Adjusted operating margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, due to a 140 basis points impact from ransomware, including both the revenue and the cost impact, which together with higher incentive based compensation and lower revenue offset savings from items such as lower C&E and the favorable movement in the rupee. Margins were also negatively impacted by the downtime incurred by employees during the transition to working from home, the sudden reduction in demand late in the first quarter and the time it set us to reduce headcount and other costs accordingly. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q2 we incurred $59 million of charges as part of this plan, including $8 million related to the exit of a subset of our content services business. The majority of the remaining charges were related to the previously announced actions to correct our pyramid structure. Net headcount declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year including the roughly 7,000 associates exited under the Fit for Growth plan. These cost actions as well as increased rigor in our performance management process are reflected in our elevated annualized attrition rate of 24%. Voluntary attrition continue the downward trend we've seen over the last four quarters to approximately 11% in Q2. Exiting Q2, the majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete and we have achieved over $425 million in annualized gross run rate savings. We still expect annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021 and charge to be in the $170 million to $200 million range. And as we've said previously, we will continue to adjust our cost structure in accordance with the macro environment while we continue to invest in areas that further our digital positioning. Savings achieved from the Fit for Growth plan are funding investments to help accelerate growth in key areas such as sales and sales-support hiring, investments in accelerating the growth of our digital portfolio, marketing and branding, investments to further digitize Cognizant, enhancing the resiliency and robustness of our delivery network to increase automation and additional nearshore and onshore capabilities to further diversify our delivery footprint and provide greater access to talent and recruiting and rescaling the top talent. In the first half of 2020, we saw total learning hours consumed grow by double-digits. And we are among the first companies globally to clock 1 million learning hours on key virtual learning platforms. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of June 30 stood at $4.6 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net balances include the approximate $1.7 million drawn on our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2020. In the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions and yesterday announced that we have signed an agreement to acquire New Signature. And today, we announced that our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. In this environment, we continue to prioritize using our balance sheet for targeted acquisitions, and at this point, have not resumed our share repurchase program. Year-to-date we have deployed $550 million on share buybacks, repurchasing over 9 million shares at an average price of $59 per share. We will continue to reevaluate the appropriate time to restart that program, which still has approximately $1.8 billion of remaining authorization. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business, while continuing to invest. We had a strong cash flow quarter, generating $886 million of free cash flow. This included the benefit of approximately $380 million in government-offered deferrals of certain tax payments in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, which will now be paid in the second half of 2020 through 2022. Excluding these benefits, free cash flow was approximately 140% of net income. DSO of 77 days was flat year-over-year. Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. So there continues to be a number of factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. Additionally, while we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline numbers we have seen in the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely correspond to the pace of economic recovery, and thus client confidence and spend. That said, we do believe we have better visibility in the business today than when we reported our Q1 earnings in May, and therefore, are providing full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline in the range of 2% to down 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to a decline of 2.2% to down 0.7% or $16.41 billion to $16.66 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 20 basis point foreign exchange impact for the full year. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 130 basis points to revenue year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4 from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business, which will be reflected in our CMP segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portion of our Products and Resources segment. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental cost associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1 and incentive compensation above 2019 levels. Following the typical seasonality of the business, we expect Q3 revenue and adjusted operating margin to be higher than Q4. Our current guidance assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and a typical cycle of furloughs. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.58. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 543 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27% in the second half of the year. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies. With that, operator, we can open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Karen, I wanted to wish you good luck.\nKaren McLoughlin: Thank you, Bryan.\nBryan Bergin: So first question here. Within your outlook, are you assuming 2Q was a trough from a growth perspective across each industry segment? So any sub-verticals that may weaken further before improving? And I heard your comment here at the end, Karen, as far as bill days for 4Q. But really my question is more so from a demand standpoint.\nKaren McLoughlin: Yeah. So I think -- and so I'll ask Brian to also chime in. But I think from a demand perspective, we're predicting relatively consistent trends as we move into the back part of the year as we saw in Q2. Certainly, as we said on the call, in our prepared remarks, travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods, we expect will continue to be under significant pressure in the back part of the year. Similarly, we are not expecting any significant recovery in Financial Services, whether that be either banking or insurance. But I do think Healthcare, certainly, we continue to expect some improvement in Healthcare as we get into the back part of the year. We had talked earlier in Q1, obviously, that in Q2, barring what happened with COVID and the ransomware that the Healthcare payer business would have started to get stronger, and certainly we've seen strengthening in their pipeline. And then we would expect to see continued good growth from our manlog sort of manufacturing, energy and utilities business as well as life sciences and the tech business once you back out the content services business. So I think really generally speaking, the same trends that we've seen in recent months.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just on the bookings number. Can you give us a sense on how much of this is new versus renewals? And Brian, can you clarify the 25% figure you noted, I thought I heard it was ex-Samlink? Is that accurate? And is this an area as you think about bookings to something you intend to provide more disclosure on going forward?\nBrian Humphries: Hi, Bryan. So yes, we grew bookings 14% in the first half, with particular strength in the digital, which grew almost 50% in the first half and then a few industries, like Healthcare, also grew very strong so too did insurance. And the reference we made to Samlink related to our global growth markets bookings, North America grew 25% plus in the first half, global growth markets was down. But in Q2, in the prior year period, we had our biggest deal in a long, long time. And I hate to normalize for bookings, and that's not how you should expect me to talk about very often, but were you to exclude that, global growth markets also grew 15% plus in the first half of the year and the total company grew 25%. Look, to be honest, when we start thinking about then the RAD model and then hunting versus farming, we actually feel very good about our momentum both in renewals as well as in new business. We've also clearly tracked the new hires of the 500 plus people, of which about two-thirds were quota-bearing and the rest were some ports. We see those to have been self-funding in the first half of this year and they're bringing through good TCV and decent margins, which more than covers the costs of those resources. So it gives us food for thought in terms of continuing to invest for growth on a go forward basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEdward Caso: Hi, good evening. All the best, Karen. Can you talk a little bit about the contribution from the acquisitions. I'm thinking that Collaborative was on the $150 million per year range and Signature in the sort of the $50 million to $60 million range. Can you sort of -- what's baked in the guidance? And then my second question is, give us an update sort of how much M&A are you looking for as part of your plan to sort of grow from here? Thank you.\nKaren McLoughlin: So I can take that, Ed, and then Brian can chime in about the future. But first of all, thank you for the nice comment. Inorganic revenue in the quarter was about two points, but Collaborative, as you know, didn't close until late in the quarter, so very small contribution in the quarter. We have not broken out the full year revenue from Collaborative, but obviously, that is baked into our guidance for the remainder of the year. And New Signature, again, we've signed it, but we have not closed and do not expect to close until later this quarter. So in terms of the back half of the year, we'll will have a very small immaterial impact on revenue. But Brian, perhaps, you want to talk about acquisitions going forward.\nBrian Humphries: Yeah. So hi, Ed. So first of all, I don't really wake up in the morning and think about how many points of growth I want to achieve next year from M&A. I think about the portfolio and our strategy and where we have gaps and where there are logical plays that can complement what we're setting out to achieve. And as you know, first and foremost, our strategy is all about accelerating digital. And therefore, the five or so deals we've done have always been 100% aligned to digital, which is why I think we've been able to feel good about deploying capital, and the board obviously have been very supportive of us in that regard as well. I will continue to use M&A as a means to support the strategy. We will do it thoughtfully, of course. I don't want anybody feel as though we take anything for granted. But in the same vein, we are organically investing behind our strategic priorities. So while we've done a series of cloud acquisitions in the last year, we have also set aside tens of millions of dollars to invest in hyperscale partners and SaaS vendors with a view to accelerating or cloud practices.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. First, congratulations, Karen. Of course, we will miss you. Brian, can you just comment based on what you're seeing with clients in the sales pipeline? How confident you are that the IT spending will remain strong as we sort of transition out of pandemic mode into recession mode? I mean, so far it's been just remarkably strong, but obviously, typically in a recession, it dips. So how -- what's your sort of confidence or how would you handicap that as you're looking out to the rest of the year? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Yeah. Look, it's a broad question, Lisa, but macro demand for the services sector, as you know, came in stronger than expected in this earnings cycle. And I actually believe that within that, we as a company, are becoming much more competitive. And hopefully, our bookings trends and our win rates and qualified pipeline illustrate that's as indeed as our digital growth and our digital mix, which augurs well for our future. I'm seeing trends of substantial acceleration through the second quarter, both in terms of bookings and indeed in terms of revenue. I'm also seeing trends amongst clients where budgets are certainly being reduced in the run-off rate space, and therefore, pricing pressure follow. So of course, automation and efficiencies and industrialization is important as is knowing what to build yourself versus what to partner on. So clearly digital is accelerating and I actually believe that COVID will single-handedly meaningfully accelerate digital. And clients will realize that digital transformation is not one or two outliers in the portfolio, they fundamentally have to get through use cases and workflows and make sure that they digitize all of that for the benefit of their clients and indeed their employees. Digital for us grew, from a bookings point of view, 50% in the first half of the year. And what was very interesting for me, as you go through the data and interrogate it is that about 75% of our digital bookings in the quarter entered the pipeline since Q1, i.e., in the first six months of the year with about 50% of the bookings being created and closed in the same quarter. So there is tremendous velocity through the channel as well. I also think clients are looking at opportunities to consolidate vendors, certainly as they're looking for commercial constructs or financial constructs that are appealing to them. They are looking at companies with strong balance sheets, companies that are willing to invest. And Lisa, I think these trends are favorable to Cognizant. If I've heard it once, I've heard it 20 times in the last month or two that Cognizant showing up more favorably is ultimately illustrative of the fact that we are unquestionably strong in run-off rate would increasingly accept it as a viable challenger brand in digital. And therefore, in any consolidation play, we will naturally in my opinion figure amongst the down-select. So I feel very, very good about our competitive position, our relative strength. We're closing the gap with the competitors, as you've seen, and I'm confident that clients will continue to spend in the second half, but along the lines of what I articulated. Last but not least, there are some large opportunities in the pipeline. Certainly, the industry or the competitors have also talked about those. In some cases, people are looking at reviewing their captive strategies, etc. I am absolutely focused on digital acceleration. We will continue to look at run-off rate and taking over some captives, but we always look about the notion of whether those businesses are accretive to our growth CAGR or dilutive. And while one can get a year-over-year quick apples-to-orange compare and the benefits, we're ultimately trying to build a book of business that is allowing us to have a faster CAGR your growth profile into the future, as is the case with the companies we have been acquiring.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. Brian or Karen, I'll direct this towards you. And I want to try to understand the puts and takes associated with the targeted operating margin of 15% for this year. And what I meant is just falling into three buckets. One is, are there still cost that's benefits are going to flow through from the 14% that you reported to get to that 15% number versus the second force, I think about as revenue variances that obviously benefit the bottom line versus the third dynamic, Brian, that you mentioned repeatedly was investing for the business. And so I'm just wondering what are the drivers? And part of the reason why I want to understand the second half dynamics, but also as a jumping-off point as we begin to think about calendar year '21? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: So I'll pitch upon Karen, if you will, the notion of investments. And Karen, if you want to touch upon then the dynamics in the second half guidance. Keith, we're not really thinking about '21 at this moment in time. Of course, we're doing a lot of work on it internally, but it's very hard to understand what's coming in the next six months, never mind the next 18 months. That being said, as ever, we will always focus on what we can control and inherent to that is our cost structure and making sure from a margin rate point of view, if the market is not volatile on the top-line, we should obviously do our best to optimize our margin rate. Specific to investments, yeah, listen, we are committed to winning and becoming preeminent in technical consulting and to be one of the leading professional services firms in the world. In order to do so, we have a series of transitions we have to make, scaling international markets, getting much more commercial coverage out there, continue to industrialize our delivery capabilities and globalizing the company as well as changing some of the brand attributes and a lot of that requires capabilities and skills. And then none of that is arguably more important than ensuring we accelerate our digital capabilities, which requires personalities, skills, talent, brand attributes, partnership ecosystem, coverage, not just from a general sales point of view, but also a specialist sales point of view. So we are committed to investing for the medium and long-term. As you know, I take my quarters very seriously. So we like to manage, I guess, our commitments in the short-term. But the fundamental principle we're setting out to achieve here is to accelerate on the medium term, the growth profile of the company to get back to what we've always been good at and inherent to that will be continued investments of the company. That's what we did and set out to achieve in 2020. Notwithstanding COVID and ransomware, we had still stayed true to our strategy of investing in digital, investing in sales coverage and so too, will you see us take the same principles into 2021. Karen, over to you for the second half guidance.\nKaren McLoughlin: Sure. Thanks, Brian, and hi, Keith. So I think in terms of how we thought about the second half margin guidance, we said approximately 15% for the full year, which puts the second half at about 15.2%. And if you think about what happened in the first half of the year, Q2 margins came in at 14.1%, and then for the first half we were at 15.2%. As we look forward, and I think about this more sequentially as we get into the back part of the year, obviously the COVID -- any COVID fulfillment issues and the revenue impact from Maze are behind us, but we will continue to have remediation cost as we get into the back part of the year. We have wages and promotions, that as we said, will take place in as effective as of October, so that will certainly put pressure on the Q4 margins. And then obviously, we're not expecting a significant acceleration in revenue based on the guidance that we've provided on a sequential basis. So those are really the biggest pieces of this. And then additionally, obviously, we've got the acquisitions. So anytime we close an acquisition, there are obviously deal costs and integration costs and so forth, which while not individually material, certainly as we look forward sequentially into the back part of the year, just given the timing of the acquisitions, both when Collaborative closed late in Q2 as well as the New Signature deal in the back half of the year will put a little bit of pressure on those margins as we get into the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMoshe Katri: Thanks. Great working with you, Karen, and best of luck. A couple of things. First, maybe to Brian. Are you comfortable that you're done with some of the actions that you wanted to take, I guess, on the sales front, on the executive team front? And maybe can you give us some color on where we are in terms of attrition more on the senior side of the headcount? Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Yeah. From an executive committee point of view, there are few more changes that are happening that we've spoken about previously. We are -- we've upgraded the profile of the managing director role in India to be a direct report to the executive committee, to me. And therefore, we have a search underway and that will ensure we have somebody based in India who will represent our 200,000 employees in India. We'd expect to fill that in the coming months. We also have a global growth markets interim leader at the moment who is doing a fantastic job for us. And we actually have signed somebody who will join the company in the foreseeable future. However, I am not today at liberty to announce who that person is. But that being said, the executive committee now is my team. We're fully onboard, fully committed, driving in the same direction. And I actually feel now I have a A Team, a world-class organization around me to bring this company forward. And I know, Jan has big shoes to fill from Karen, but he will step in and I think culturally will be a great fit for us. With regards to the rest of the organization, voluntary attrition has declined now to about 10.5%. And this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've had voluntary attrition declines. But in the same vein, what we have been doing very intentionally has been to continue to deploy much more of a performance orientation in the company, which means that we are now removing the underperformers on an annual basis. And then on top of that, given the volatility we've seen in the top-line, in the early part of this year, notably because of COVID, it goes without saying that we have responsibilities vis-a-vis, our shareholders, yes, to protect digital skills. But in the same vein, we also have to protect the bottom line by optimizing our team and our bench around the revenue curve. And that's why you've seen in recent quarters a disparity between total attrition levels versus voluntary attrition levels or involuntary levels. And if you look in the supplementary slides, we've actually now started breaking that item on a quarterly basis. So you will see a four quarter trend emerge. I feel very good about the direction we're taking the company. We have just completed actually, earlier this year, what we call Cognizant's People Engagement Survey. And actually, the survey results show that our results are very often better than industry across major categories and up in almost every category in the last two years. So I think morale is actually picking up. I think when we execute well, and I believe our employees were the heroes of this quarter, despite an extremely challenging environments, we executed well and delivered against our commitments, and I think success breeds success. So I'm feeling very good about our ability to continue to engage and motivate and attract world-class talent to Cognizant.\nMoshe Katri: That's helpful. And then given the fact that digital is going to be one of those main drivers down the road, and you've indicated that you've had a pretty significant uptick in digital bookings here, I guess, for the first half of the year. Are you -- maybe we can get some more color on some of those wins. Are you kind of going head-to-head against some of the pure plays? Are you actually going back and getting some of these deals from existing customers? How does that -- how it's actually working?\nBrian Humphries: Look, I've got to be honest. I feel really ecstatic about our momentum in digital. We're doing a tremendous job. I mean, first half bookings growth was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive, and indeed, our software-as-a-service offerings. And we are going head-to-head with the incumbents, be they integrated or portfolio companies or pure plays and winning more than our fair share. And if anything, what I'm finding is clients are highly receptive to our capabilities and to our portfolio, not all of them knew about that portfolio historically. And so, we're being much more aggressive in getting out there, marketing our digital capabilities and going to market with a broad partnership system. And of course, all of that leads to a wonderful outcome that the faster we grow digital, the bigger it becomes as a percentage of our revenue. And therefore, that pays dividends in terms of the overall future company CAGR prospects. So I truly feel we're in a wonderful position. And I feel very confident about our competitive dynamics. And we're happy to get in the boxing ring with any competitor. And I think we'll win more than our fair share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you so much. And Karen, wish you all the best. Thanks for the partnership after all these years. My question builds on what Moshe just asked. I'm just -- I'm curious with voluntary attrition trending better -- and thanks for the data, by the way. It sounds like you're mostly done with the headcount cuts. Can we say that the culture is in a good place here, Brian? And it's a hard question to answer, I know, but what I'm getting at is just this concept of transitioning to growth with the culture and we're seeing this growing divide across a lot of tech firms now where the culture between legacy and digital firms is quite stark. So where do you fall in that spectrum versus where you want to be? Is there a way to address that here on the call? Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Well, I think it goes without saying that if there ever is a growth culture and the company with a growth culture, it is Cognizant. And maybe in recent years we had lost our mojo a little bit, but this company is full of people who pride themselves in serving clients and actually outgunning the competition. And that's certainly how I feel we will continue to be focus in the years ahead. So I feel very good about our capabilities and very good about the culture, not just an aggressive culture, but also a culture of focus on client centricity and a culture of focus on continuous learning and making sure we have look wherewithal to go out and outcompete the competition. Again, I'm not at all concerned about that. I actually think the place where we have sharpened our pencils a little bit in the last year has been much more around partnering with the hyperscalers and making sure that as the world shifts to platform and micro services and open APIs, etc. that we are fully in ensconced with those characters and making sure that we are showing up to clients together. But generally, I feel as our culture is a winning culture, it's a growth culture and it's a culture that's always been about being a challenger and beating the competition. We certainly have strong credentials. I see that every single day when I talk to clients and I see a tremendous amount of receptivity to Cognizant's ambition to win in digital.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRod Bourgeois: Hey, Brian. So my question is simply, you're definitely feeling much better about bookings and competitiveness now than it appears you were a year ago. Can you just articulate what's the main change that's happened that's giving you this added confidence? How much of the change is the market turning maybe more in your favor vertically and with certain parts of digital? And how much of it is -- you talked about client centricity changing the culture and so on. Can you articulate what the main thing that's recently changed that's making your outlook on competitiveness sounds so much better?\nBrian Humphries: Well, I think first of all, the quality of the dialog that we're having as an executive committee, the level of engagement, level of harmony at the executive team is now truly what I would term world-class. We are all in this together. We're all partnering and teaming and we've got the whole organization I think motivated to win. And I don't want to underestimate the benefit of having a focus on growth and a reinvigorated focus on client centricity. I think at the client partner level, we've had that over the years. But perhaps in more recent years, we had a number of distractions on the outside, and perhaps even some financial model changes that didn't allow us to do what I think we need to do. So I feel very good about the harmony of the team, the level of energy. And frankly, that is permeating throughout the entire organization. And there's just, again, once again somewhat of a feel good factor happening in Cognizant these days. I think also, we have better instrumentation in the business. I think we have got much more data now at our fingertips than we had a year ago and we've got a stronger partnerships than we had perhaps a year ago. And generally, I think this has not been an easy 15 months or 16 months, there's been a lot of work. And these last few months have been particularly challenging, as everybody can imagine given macro as well as micro elements that are at play, vis-a-vis, Cognizant. But -- and the other thing, digital is a bigger portion of the mix. And let's face it, that's where the growth is in the market. My board have been extremely supportive of our ambitions to scale there. The organic investments are for me and my leadership team to work through, but when it comes to deploying the balance sheet, we obviously have close communication and coordination with the board of directors. And we have been aggressively moving. And in turn, we have scaled out our capabilities meaningfully. And acquisitions like Collaborative Solutions work wonders because our pipeline immediately builds in some of our existing accounts. New signature, similarly, I think you'll see our ability to scale the Microsoft business practice rapidly. So I just think the portfolio is broader. The leadership team are more harmonious. There's more energy. And we're completely focused on winning again. And any external distractions over the last few years are 100% behind us at this moment in time.\nKatie Royce: Hi. This is Katie. I just want to say thank you all for joining and for your questions. I think that's all the time that we have for tonight.\nOperator: Once again, thank you for joining us on today conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody. Today I'd like to cover four topics with you including, a summary of our second quarter performance, an update on our purpose, vision and strategy, some thought on the macro demand environments and evolving client needs and an update on our efforts to ensure the highest levels of resiliency to our clients. Before I proceed with our second quarter earnings call, I would like to add some commentary to today's announcement that Karen McLoughlin has decided to retire from Cognizant after more than eight years as Chief Financial Officer and an incredibly successful career in the company spanning almost 70 years. During this time Karen's role in helping Cognizant become one of the world's leading professional services companies cannot be overstated. It's been a privilege to work with Karen over the past 16 months and I am forever indebted for her assistance and leadership. Karen, on behalf of the entire Cognizant family, I'd like to thank you for your many contributions to Cognizant. You've done a fantastic job and can be proud of your accomplishments. We wish you nothing, but success in your future endeavors. We are excited to welcome Jan Siegmund to Cognizant. Jan has been accomplished executive with a wealth of experience in finance, strategy and general management. Jan will join us in the CFO role on September 01, 2020. Karen will continue in her capacity as CFO through August 31st and then remain with us in an advisory role through December 31, 2020, thereby ensuring a smooth CFO transition. Most recent Jan served as Chief Financial Officer of ADP, a role which he held for seven years. It follow that many of you will recognize his name and will experiencing engaging with Jan in the past. You'll understand therefore why is the right choice to be our next CFO and why I look forward to working alongside him. Now let's go back to our earnings, I'm pleased with our second quarter performance. Faced with the unprecedented challenges of global pandemic and the ransomware attack that impacted our operations, we executed well. We stay true to our digital strategy and fulfilled the responsibilities to our multiple stakeholders, including our associates, our clients, our shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Second quarter revenue was $4 million, a decline of 2.5% year-over-year in constant currency. And this included a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain nonstrategic content services business, which we announced in Q3 2019. We have now fully exited this subset of services. Our associates are the true heroes of the quarter not just in my eyes, but also the eyes of our clients who are at the center of everything we do. Associates around the world quickly adopted to work from home conditions, staying productive and help our client successfully navigate the initial shock of the pandemic and when we became the victim of a ransomware attack in April, their instinctive client-centricity kicked in. We intentionally ensured that we were highly visible, transparent and cooperative with clients who recognize our perseverance and professionalism and how hard we work to ensure their mission-critical services were uninterrupted. Therefore, I want to thank our leadership team and all our associates throughout the world for their dedication to our clients and their contribution to our performance in the quarter. We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates. We communicate regularly and transparently with them and have equipped them for virtual working and rewarded a large portion of our associate base with a 25% salary increase payment for the month of April to recognize their extraordinary continuity of services efforts. People are the heart of our business, so employee engagement is therefore critical and I'm pleased to report that our recent annual companywide people engagement survey shows that our engagement scores are up across all major categories. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter, but I wanted to emphasize two salient points. First, we are gaining commercial momentum. This is illustrated by our bookings trends, which grew 40% year-over-year in the first half of 2020 notwithstanding the challenges we face in the quarter. North America, which grew 25% plus in the first half is particularly strong. This was offset by declines in global growth markets given the signature of the Samlink agreement in Q2 2019. Excluding the impact of Samlink, total company booking grew 25% plus in the first half 2020 and global growth market bookings grew in the mid teens. Our bookings momentum is broad-based across our service lines and industries. Bookings accelerated through Q2 with June being an exceptional month. Moreover leading indicators are strong with qualified pipeline up double digits year-over-year and win rates continue to be solid. Second, we are making noteworthy progress in digital. In the second quarter, revenue in digital grew 14% year-over-year and now represents 42% of our digital -- of our company revenue mix. First half 2020 digital bookings growth of almost 50% was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive and software as a service. I'm confident that our digital momentum will continue given the strength of leading indicators. Clients are also highly receptive to Cognizant's digital capabilities given not just our strong portfolio and strong customer satisfaction, but also their desire to see us challenge digital incumbents, importantly, it's becomes the virtual circle as the greater our digital mix, the greater our overall company growth prospects. This takes me to second topic, which is about purpose and vision and their connection to engagement values and our strategy. The executive leadership team and I have given a great deal of thought to how we optimize the engagement we get from our 280,000 person knowledge business, which spans multigenerational and a diverse workforce. In recent months, we set out to develop and communicate a purpose and vision statement, as well as reviewing the values that establish how we work. We believe this is an important and it's part of our long-term success and we will be rolling out what we're calling the Cognizant agenda to the entire company in August. It's worth taking a moment to run through the key elements of this. We define Cognizant's purpose this way. We engineer modern businesses to improve everyday life. This statement explains why we're in business and serves as our inspirational North Star and driving force. Our purpose also conveyed that while we are B2B company, the work we do with and for our clients helps improve the lives of billions of people. Most important, it rings true with our culture as evidenced by how well we dealt with the unprecedented challenges of recent months. To measure how well we're living our purpose and clarify what we aspire to achieve, we set out a vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the global 2000 C-suite. This is where our strategy comes into play as we aim to execute a series of bold moves to realize our vision and these actions call for us to accelerate digital, optimize our core business, transform our commercial model, supercharge our talents and enhance our reputation. Accelerating digital is at the heart of our strategy and I have two fundamental beliefs on this topic. First, we are still in the early stages of digital and the COVID-19 pandemic is single-handedly significantly accelerating the shift to digital and second, Cognizant is a global scale portfolio and strategic client relationships to be one of the single biggest beneficiaries of the shift in the coming years. Put simply, digital creates an enormous opportunity for Cognizant and we intend to capture this. While the industry has been talking about digital transformation for years, many companies have yet make the transition to a fully digital operating model instead digitizing only select operations. In a matter of months, COVID-19 has exposed the extent of the digital divide between digital natives and traditional companies. Migrating infrastructure application and data states to a more flexible resilient and cost-effective cloud architecture to the start with in itself insufficient. Clients are increasingly shifting their focus to modernizing their core processes to be truly agile so that they can continually improve the value proposition and experience the offer to their customers and employees and our strategy is built on our ability to leverage our strength in the applications and data management service layers. To enable agile workflows to our clients, can deliver customer and business value simultaneously. We fully execute this strategy. We withdrawn our broad portfolio and a rich heritage of delivery excellence, partly with our clients to deliver business outcomes with innovative solutions that leverage our internal capabilities and those of our partner ecosystem. Winning in digital requires a broad ecosystem of partners and therefore, as cloud computing has changed the way IT has delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms. We have meaningfully increased our partnership focus and investments with all three leading hyperscale companies and our most strategic software as a service partners. We've complemented organic investments with a targeted M&A strategy focused 100% on digital. Earlier in the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions expands our opportunity in cloud by establishing a new practice in its large fast growing market. It also differentiates us in particular against offshore competitors. Yesterday we announced our fifth cloud-related acquisition of the past year, New Signature, one of the world's largest independent Microsoft public cloud transformation specialist that serves all three Microsoft clouds. This will provide a foundation for a dedicated Microsoft business group within Cognizant. Underscoring our success in executing our strategy, we were recently named the 2020 Microsoft Partner of the Year for SAP on Azure as well as the leader in Gartner's 2020 magic quadrant portfolio infrastructure professional and managed services worldwide. Let's turn now to the demand environment and I'll start with some positive news. First, micro demand although still uncertain in better that we anticipated in April. Second, revenue growth in bookings momentum improved through the second quarter. Third, we remain confident that our digital, clients, industry and geographic revenue mix positions us favorably and fourth, clients are consolidating vendors as they seek more strategic partners to help them through the implications of COVID-19. This is favorable for Cognizant. In fact, we are increasingly seen as a strategic partner, not just in the run-off rate but also in digital. We are nonetheless cautious about macro demand environment, while the fiscal stimulus has helped, higher unemployment rates remain a concern, COVID-19 cases were on the rise in many states and countries and many of the seats with executives I speak with, are breaking for a period of prolonged economic disruption. Therefore, the footpath forward may be one of continued caution. This means continued rigor on discretionary spending, the protection of key skills and targeted investments for growth. So what does the future hold? We believe the implications of the pandemic will be broad and lasting. The nature of work in our society will change across many dimensions, including how we interact, communicate, embrace technology and think about risk. The practical limitations of business are consequential and go well beyond the return to office timelines, business continuity planning, the question of the shift to virtual agile or questions about the future of business travel or commercial real estate policies, both of which I believe will be changed forever. I think of clients and prospects every single day and many seems to be moving through three broad stages. First, the commitments to keep their employees safe and their business is running without interruption. Second, an adoption phase to the new normal, which includes the considerable technological and human implications of working from anywhere and third, the need to truly embrace digital to stay competitive. This requires them to fully modernized their businesses across infrastructure, data and applications. There is an increasing recognition that we were in a mobile virtual and personal era for clients and employees expect always on an ubiquitous consumer grade software experiences with rich visualization tools, data integration and data protection. These needs are reflected in changing client needs and buying behavior. We see clients embrace agile development and platforms of micro services that foster innovation, unlock the power of data and offer efficiency, security, scalability and agility. This requirement aligns directly with our strategy to win in digital including cloud, AI and analytics, digital engineering and IoT. To help clients grapple with the changes brought by COVID-19, we've also developed capabilities to help them prosper in the post-COVID world. These offerings which span our portfolio includes the following. Virtual workplace an enterprise-level solution that helps companies achieve resilience and maintain productivity even in massive disruption. Data modernization, which helps clients fix how they source, interpret and consume information through flexible data structures and a modern data and analytics platform and Cognizant safe buildings, which combines layered prevention controls with instrumentation, data analytics and digital technologies to help make building safe for occupancy by providing robust monitoring and visualization capabilities. Recognize too that COVID-19 coincided with a period of societal turmoil amid significant questions about racial justice, globalization and corporate social responsibility to not only our clients businesses and technological requirements changing, but so too are the demands of their vendors and people underscore our intensified commitment to social responsibility. Cognizant and its foundations have a long history of contributing to the health, well-being, education and progress of the communities in which we live and work. In April, for example we announced an initial 10 million philanthropic commitment to support communities around the world in addressing COVID-19's immediate and long-term impacts. In June, the Cognizant US foundation announced a $5 million commitment to communities of color, the continuation of its long-standing work to advance education, training and career pathways for underrepresented populations across the US. And in late 2019, as we announced our decision to exit a subset of content moderation, we allocated $5 million to fund research aimed at reducing users exposure to objectionable content. We're also proud to support global work to remediate COVID-19. More than 100,000 researchers and clinicians are now using our shared investigator platform, a life sciences software-as-a-service solution and some of their work is focused on accelerating the development of COVID-19 therapies through virtual clinical trial processes. We're also providing a team of our life sciences experts to support Verily, the health and life sciences company of Alphabet, with it's baseline of COVID-19 testing program to increase individual access to scheduling. In the wake of the unprecedented clean challenges of COVID-19 and an ransomware attack, we like many of our clients are increasingly focused on improving our business resiliency, especially within our delivery and technology organizations. Let me first address delivery. While I'm extremely proud of our delivery team, and how well they enable the safety of our associates and continuity of mission-critical services for our clients, the pandemic highlighted the need to increase the robustness and resiliency of our delivery operations. We are taking a fresh look at our delivery organization and defining a next-generation delivery model that will extend the work we've done in recent years to further globalize our network of delivery centers across the globe, which will complement our India hub. This will ensure greater resiliency, enable us to better service our client's needs for scrum teams nearshore and onshore and give us greater access to global talent. Automation will of course be pervasive to grab. And on the point of technology, I've appointed a new head of technology and strategy who will report directly to me and focus on informing our strategy, digitizing our business and strengthening our IT and security capabilities. Their first priority when they start next week on August 3, will be to complete our IT and securities remediation efforts. We've devoted substantial time and resources toward remediation and as a result have made significant progress in recent months. Not only have we essentially completely contained and eradicated ransomware, we've also begun what we expect will be a multi-quarter initiative to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. A subcommittee of the Board of Directors will help me provide oversight of these efforts, which is being conducted in conjunction with external security experts. In closing for several quarters I've been speaking with you about our multiyear effort to reposition Cognizant to achieve its full growth potential, as we execute the initiatives of the transformation office. We've not let COVID-19 or ransomware distract us from his work and we've made steady progress across many dimensions, including accelerating our digital strategy, globalizing Cognizant and increasing our relevance to clients. These teams require ongoing investments including our portfolio of brands, our talent and our partnerships. While more work is needed in the quarters ahead, I am confident about Cognizant's growing stature and our competitive position. We're controlling what we can control, making progress in our competitiveness relative to peers and positioning ourselves for commercial momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen and will now take you through the details of the quarter and our outlook before going to questions and answers. Karen, over to you. Hi, Bryan. So yes, we grew bookings 14% in the first half, with particular strength in the digital, which grew almost 50% in the first half and then a few industries, like Healthcare, also grew very strong so too did insurance. And the reference we made to Samlink related to our global growth markets bookings, North America grew 25% plus in the first half, global growth markets was down. But in Q2, in the prior year period, we had our biggest deal in a long, long time. And I hate to normalize for bookings, and that's not how you should expect me to talk about very often, but were you to exclude that, global growth markets also grew 15% plus in the first half of the year and the total company grew 25%. Look, to be honest, when we start thinking about then the RAD model and then hunting versus farming, we actually feel very good about our momentum both in renewals as well as in new business. We've also clearly tracked the new hires of the 500 plus people, of which about two-thirds were quota-bearing and the rest were some ports. We see those to have been self-funding in the first half of this year and they're bringing through good TCV and decent margins, which more than covers the costs of those resources. So it gives us food for thought in terms of continuing to invest for growth on a go forward basis. Yeah. So hi, Ed. So first of all, I don't really wake up in the morning and think about how many points of growth I want to achieve next year from M&A. I think about the portfolio and our strategy and where we have gaps and where there are logical plays that can complement what we're setting out to achieve. And as you know, first and foremost, our strategy is all about accelerating digital. And therefore, the five or so deals we've done have always been 100% aligned to digital, which is why I think we've been able to feel good about deploying capital, and the board obviously have been very supportive of us in that regard as well. I will continue to use M&A as a means to support the strategy. We will do it thoughtfully, of course. I don't want anybody feel as though we take anything for granted. But in the same vein, we are organically investing behind our strategic priorities. So while we've done a series of cloud acquisitions in the last year, we have also set aside tens of millions of dollars to invest in hyperscale partners and SaaS vendors with a view to accelerating or cloud practices. Yeah. Look, it's a broad question, Lisa, but macro demand for the services sector, as you know, came in stronger than expected in this earnings cycle. And I actually believe that within that, we as a company, are becoming much more competitive. And hopefully, our bookings trends and our win rates and qualified pipeline illustrate that's as indeed as our digital growth and our digital mix, which augurs well for our future. I'm seeing trends of substantial acceleration through the second quarter, both in terms of bookings and indeed in terms of revenue. I'm also seeing trends amongst clients where budgets are certainly being reduced in the run-off rate space, and therefore, pricing pressure follow. So of course, automation and efficiencies and industrialization is important as is knowing what to build yourself versus what to partner on. So clearly digital is accelerating and I actually believe that COVID will single-handedly meaningfully accelerate digital. And clients will realize that digital transformation is not one or two outliers in the portfolio, they fundamentally have to get through use cases and workflows and make sure that they digitize all of that for the benefit of their clients and indeed their employees. Digital for us grew, from a bookings point of view, 50% in the first half of the year. And what was very interesting for me, as you go through the data and interrogate it is that about 75% of our digital bookings in the quarter entered the pipeline since Q1, i.e., in the first six months of the year with about 50% of the bookings being created and closed in the same quarter. So there is tremendous velocity through the channel as well. I also think clients are looking at opportunities to consolidate vendors, certainly as they're looking for commercial constructs or financial constructs that are appealing to them. They are looking at companies with strong balance sheets, companies that are willing to invest. And Lisa, I think these trends are favorable to Cognizant. If I've heard it once, I've heard it 20 times in the last month or two that Cognizant showing up more favorably is ultimately illustrative of the fact that we are unquestionably strong in run-off rate would increasingly accept it as a viable challenger brand in digital. And therefore, in any consolidation play, we will naturally in my opinion figure amongst the down-select. So I feel very, very good about our competitive position, our relative strength. We're closing the gap with the competitors, as you've seen, and I'm confident that clients will continue to spend in the second half, but along the lines of what I articulated. Last but not least, there are some large opportunities in the pipeline. Certainly, the industry or the competitors have also talked about those. In some cases, people are looking at reviewing their captive strategies, etc. I am absolutely focused on digital acceleration. We will continue to look at run-off rate and taking over some captives, but we always look about the notion of whether those businesses are accretive to our growth CAGR or dilutive. And while one can get a year-over-year quick apples-to-orange compare and the benefits, we're ultimately trying to build a book of business that is allowing us to have a faster CAGR your growth profile into the future, as is the case with the companies we have been acquiring. So I'll pitch upon Karen, if you will, the notion of investments. And Karen, if you want to touch upon then the dynamics in the second half guidance. Keith, we're not really thinking about '21 at this moment in time. Of course, we're doing a lot of work on it internally, but it's very hard to understand what's coming in the next six months, never mind the next 18 months. That being said, as ever, we will always focus on what we can control and inherent to that is our cost structure and making sure from a margin rate point of view, if the market is not volatile on the top-line, we should obviously do our best to optimize our margin rate. Specific to investments, yeah, listen, we are committed to winning and becoming preeminent in technical consulting and to be one of the leading professional services firms in the world. In order to do so, we have a series of transitions we have to make, scaling international markets, getting much more commercial coverage out there, continue to industrialize our delivery capabilities and globalizing the company as well as changing some of the brand attributes and a lot of that requires capabilities and skills. And then none of that is arguably more important than ensuring we accelerate our digital capabilities, which requires personalities, skills, talent, brand attributes, partnership ecosystem, coverage, not just from a general sales point of view, but also a specialist sales point of view. So we are committed to investing for the medium and long-term. As you know, I take my quarters very seriously. So we like to manage, I guess, our commitments in the short-term. But the fundamental principle we're setting out to achieve here is to accelerate on the medium term, the growth profile of the company to get back to what we've always been good at and inherent to that will be continued investments of the company. That's what we did and set out to achieve in 2020. Notwithstanding COVID and ransomware, we had still stayed true to our strategy of investing in digital, investing in sales coverage and so too, will you see us take the same principles into 2021. Karen, over to you for the second half guidance. Yeah. From an executive committee point of view, there are few more changes that are happening that we've spoken about previously. We are -- we've upgraded the profile of the managing director role in India to be a direct report to the executive committee, to me. And therefore, we have a search underway and that will ensure we have somebody based in India who will represent our 200,000 employees in India. We'd expect to fill that in the coming months. We also have a global growth markets interim leader at the moment who is doing a fantastic job for us. And we actually have signed somebody who will join the company in the foreseeable future. However, I am not today at liberty to announce who that person is. But that being said, the executive committee now is my team. We're fully onboard, fully committed, driving in the same direction. And I actually feel now I have a A Team, a world-class organization around me to bring this company forward. And I know, Jan has big shoes to fill from Karen, but he will step in and I think culturally will be a great fit for us. With regards to the rest of the organization, voluntary attrition has declined now to about 10.5%. And this is the fourth quarter in a row that we've had voluntary attrition declines. But in the same vein, what we have been doing very intentionally has been to continue to deploy much more of a performance orientation in the company, which means that we are now removing the underperformers on an annual basis. And then on top of that, given the volatility we've seen in the top-line, in the early part of this year, notably because of COVID, it goes without saying that we have responsibilities vis-a-vis, our shareholders, yes, to protect digital skills. But in the same vein, we also have to protect the bottom line by optimizing our team and our bench around the revenue curve. And that's why you've seen in recent quarters a disparity between total attrition levels versus voluntary attrition levels or involuntary levels. And if you look in the supplementary slides, we've actually now started breaking that item on a quarterly basis. So you will see a four quarter trend emerge. I feel very good about the direction we're taking the company. We have just completed actually, earlier this year, what we call Cognizant's People Engagement Survey. And actually, the survey results show that our results are very often better than industry across major categories and up in almost every category in the last two years. So I think morale is actually picking up. I think when we execute well, and I believe our employees were the heroes of this quarter, despite an extremely challenging environments, we executed well and delivered against our commitments, and I think success breeds success. So I'm feeling very good about our ability to continue to engage and motivate and attract world-class talent to Cognizant. Look, I've got to be honest. I feel really ecstatic about our momentum in digital. We're doing a tremendous job. I mean, first half bookings growth was fueled by digital engineering, AI and analytics, interactive, and indeed, our software-as-a-service offerings. And we are going head-to-head with the incumbents, be they integrated or portfolio companies or pure plays and winning more than our fair share. And if anything, what I'm finding is clients are highly receptive to our capabilities and to our portfolio, not all of them knew about that portfolio historically. And so, we're being much more aggressive in getting out there, marketing our digital capabilities and going to market with a broad partnership system. And of course, all of that leads to a wonderful outcome that the faster we grow digital, the bigger it becomes as a percentage of our revenue. And therefore, that pays dividends in terms of the overall future company CAGR prospects. So I truly feel we're in a wonderful position. And I feel very confident about our competitive dynamics. And we're happy to get in the boxing ring with any competitor. And I think we'll win more than our fair share. Well, I think it goes without saying that if there ever is a growth culture and the company with a growth culture, it is Cognizant. And maybe in recent years we had lost our mojo a little bit, but this company is full of people who pride themselves in serving clients and actually outgunning the competition. And that's certainly how I feel we will continue to be focus in the years ahead. So I feel very good about our capabilities and very good about the culture, not just an aggressive culture, but also a culture of focus on client centricity and a culture of focus on continuous learning and making sure we have look wherewithal to go out and outcompete the competition. Again, I'm not at all concerned about that. I actually think the place where we have sharpened our pencils a little bit in the last year has been much more around partnering with the hyperscalers and making sure that as the world shifts to platform and micro services and open APIs, etc. that we are fully in ensconced with those characters and making sure that we are showing up to clients together. But generally, I feel as our culture is a winning culture, it's a growth culture and it's a culture that's always been about being a challenger and beating the competition. We certainly have strong credentials. I see that every single day when I talk to clients and I see a tremendous amount of receptivity to Cognizant's ambition to win in digital. Well, I think first of all, the quality of the dialog that we're having as an executive committee, the level of engagement, level of harmony at the executive team is now truly what I would term world-class. We are all in this together. We're all partnering and teaming and we've got the whole organization I think motivated to win. And I don't want to underestimate the benefit of having a focus on growth and a reinvigorated focus on client centricity. I think at the client partner level, we've had that over the years. But perhaps in more recent years, we had a number of distractions on the outside, and perhaps even some financial model changes that didn't allow us to do what I think we need to do. So I feel very good about the harmony of the team, the level of energy. And frankly, that is permeating throughout the entire organization. And there's just, again, once again somewhat of a feel good factor happening in Cognizant these days. I think also, we have better instrumentation in the business. I think we have got much more data now at our fingertips than we had a year ago and we've got a stronger partnerships than we had perhaps a year ago. And generally, I think this has not been an easy 15 months or 16 months, there's been a lot of work. And these last few months have been particularly challenging, as everybody can imagine given macro as well as micro elements that are at play, vis-a-vis, Cognizant. But -- and the other thing, digital is a bigger portion of the mix. And let's face it, that's where the growth is in the market. My board have been extremely supportive of our ambitions to scale there. The organic investments are for me and my leadership team to work through, but when it comes to deploying the balance sheet, we obviously have close communication and coordination with the board of directors. And we have been aggressively moving. And in turn, we have scaled out our capabilities meaningfully. And acquisitions like Collaborative Solutions work wonders because our pipeline immediately builds in some of our existing accounts. New signature, similarly, I think you'll see our ability to scale the Microsoft business practice rapidly. So I just think the portfolio is broader. The leadership team are more harmonious. There's more energy. And we're completely focused on winning again. And any external distractions over the last few years are 100% behind us at this moment in time."

            "name": "Karen McLoughlin",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start with my prepared remarks I'd like to take a moment to say that my 17 years at Cognizant have been more rewarding than I could have ever imagined. During my eight years as CFO, we have grown from 138,000 associate and about $6.1 billion in annual revenue to over 280,000 associate and over $16 billion in annual revenue today and I'm very proud of our achievements along the way. I've been honored and privileged to work alongside our associates around the world with passion and commitment to our client, our colleagues and our community never ceases to amaze me. This is a very special company with a wonderful future. I am so pleased to pass the baton to Jan Siegmund, who, as many of you know is a very accomplished executive. I am confident Jan will do a wonderful job working alongside Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team to lead the company forward. In the meantime, I look forward to working with Jan, Brian and the rest of the Cognizant team through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition. Now let me turn to our results. Second quarter revenue of $4 billion declined 3.4% year-over-year or 2.5% in constant currency including a negative 120 basis points impact from the exit of certain content related services and a negative 90 basis points from the ransomware attack impact on fulfillment, the latter which was skewed towards our financial services and healthcare segment. After working through COVID-19 related fulfillment challenges early in the quarter, we saw improved momentum in May and June driven by double-digit growth in our digital service offerings, particularly in areas such as cloud and enterprise application services, IT modernization and digital engineering. Moving to the industry verticals, we're all of the growth rate provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services declined 4.3% with softness in both banking and insurance. We continue to see weakness across global banking accounts. Capital markets which is roughly 40% of total banking revenue continues to be under the most pressure and additionally, the macro backdrop has negatively impacted client in the payment sector, particularly those with significant exposure to travel and hospitality volume. Healthcare grew 2.2% led by strong double-digit growth in life sciences in Europe primarily driven by the Zenith Technologies acquisition. Within our healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digit. I want to highlight that the leading indicators of our healthcare business including software license sales, new logos, qualified pipeline and booking are significantly better than one year ago. Products and resources declined 5% with double digit growth in manufacturing, logic logistics, energy and utilities offset by double-digit declines in travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods where we expect continued pressure in the second half of the year as a result of the ongoing pandemic. In manufacturing and logistics, we are expanding our wallet share with our largest accounts and saw an uptick in deal wins leveraging our strengthened partnerships with both cloud and SaaS providers. Communications, media and technology declined 3.2% including the approximately negative $48 million impact of technology from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business where the vast majority of our work has now ramped down. Excluding this negative 790 basis points impact, we saw approximately 5% growth in communications, media and technology. Performance was flat in communications and media as growth of certain communications client was offset by a weakness with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks. We expect continued pressure in media and entertainment in the second half of the year. Overall the demand environment in the second half remains uncertain, but we believe that we are gaining competitiveness across industries. As Brian mentioned, booking and pipeline are solid and we've made progress strengthening our partnerships. Here are a few examples of how we are working with our strategic technology partners. A client in the tollroad operator business had legacy systems located in primary and backup data centers just a mile apart from each other jeopardizing resiliency. The client was also experiencing the liability and performance issues with its commercial back office and CRM business applications. We migrated there on-prim back office, external website and all databases to AWS in just two months, streamlining all customer interactions. We are now building the new back office on an open source serverless architecture, enabling annual savings of up to 40% in infrastructure operational costs. And with Verizon's ThingSpace IoT platform now integrated with Microsoft Azure, Cognizant is the first company to leverage the combined solution platform to develop its own IoT-enabled application on cold chain to support pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries impacted by the pandemic. Temperature sensitive products can now be monitored to ensure product integrity from shipping through to the consumer and Cognizant and Google Cloud are already working with financial services organizations to modernize legacy platforms and digitally transform core banking. For multiple banks we're running core banking solutions based on Temenos technology with Google Cloud. Moving on to margins, in Q2 our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 11.7% and $0.67 respectively. Adjusted operating margins, which excludes restructuring and COVID related charges of 14.1% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82. COVID-related charges were $25 million in the quarter primarily related to the previously announced one-time salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines. Adjusted operating margin was down 200 basis points year-over-year, due to a 140 basis points impact from ransomware, including both the revenue and the cost impact, which together with higher incentive based compensation and lower revenue offset savings from items such as lower C&E and the favorable movement in the rupee. Margins were also negatively impacted by the downtime incurred by employees during the transition to working from home, the sudden reduction in demand late in the first quarter and the time it set us to reduce headcount and other costs accordingly. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q2 we incurred $59 million of charges as part of this plan, including $8 million related to the exit of a subset of our content services business. The majority of the remaining charges were related to the previously announced actions to correct our pyramid structure. Net headcount declined approximately 2.5% year-over-year including the roughly 7,000 associates exited under the Fit for Growth plan. These cost actions as well as increased rigor in our performance management process are reflected in our elevated annualized attrition rate of 24%. Voluntary attrition continue the downward trend we've seen over the last four quarters to approximately 11% in Q2. Exiting Q2, the majority of the actions under Fit for Growth are complete and we have achieved over $425 million in annualized gross run rate savings. We still expect annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021 and charge to be in the $170 million to $200 million range. And as we've said previously, we will continue to adjust our cost structure in accordance with the macro environment while we continue to invest in areas that further our digital positioning. Savings achieved from the Fit for Growth plan are funding investments to help accelerate growth in key areas such as sales and sales-support hiring, investments in accelerating the growth of our digital portfolio, marketing and branding, investments to further digitize Cognizant, enhancing the resiliency and robustness of our delivery network to increase automation and additional nearshore and onshore capabilities to further diversify our delivery footprint and provide greater access to talent and recruiting and rescaling the top talent. In the first half of 2020, we saw total learning hours consumed grow by double-digits. And we are among the first companies globally to clock 1 million learning hours on key virtual learning platforms. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of June 30 stood at $4.6 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Our outstanding net balances include the approximate $1.7 million drawn on our revolving credit facility in the first quarter of 2020. In the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Collaborative Solutions and yesterday announced that we have signed an agreement to acquire New Signature. And today, we announced that our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. In this environment, we continue to prioritize using our balance sheet for targeted acquisitions, and at this point, have not resumed our share repurchase program. Year-to-date we have deployed $550 million on share buybacks, repurchasing over 9 million shares at an average price of $59 per share. We will continue to reevaluate the appropriate time to restart that program, which still has approximately $1.8 billion of remaining authorization. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business, while continuing to invest. We had a strong cash flow quarter, generating $886 million of free cash flow. This included the benefit of approximately $380 million in government-offered deferrals of certain tax payments in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, which will now be paid in the second half of 2020 through 2022. Excluding these benefits, free cash flow was approximately 140% of net income. DSO of 77 days was flat year-over-year. Now turning to guidance. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, and the pace of recovery complicated by the evolving nature of the coronavirus pandemic. So there continues to be a number of factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. Additionally, while we are pleased with the solid bookings and pipeline numbers we have seen in the business year-to-date, how that pipeline converts to revenue will likely correspond to the pace of economic recovery, and thus client confidence and spend. That said, we do believe we have better visibility in the business today than when we reported our Q1 earnings in May, and therefore, are providing full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue to decline in the range of 2% to down 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to a decline of 2.2% to down 0.7% or $16.41 billion to $16.66 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 20 basis point foreign exchange impact for the full year. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 130 basis points to revenue year-over-year in both Q3 and Q4 from our decision to exit certain work within our content services business, which will be reflected in our CMP segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and the retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality portion of our Products and Resources segment. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 15%, which assumes incremental cost associated with the remediation of the ransomware attack, wage increases and promotions for certain of our associates effective October 1 and incentive compensation above 2019 levels. Following the typical seasonality of the business, we expect Q3 revenue and adjusted operating margin to be higher than Q4. Our current guidance assumes that Q4 revenue will be negatively impacted by lower bill days versus Q3 and a typical cycle of furloughs. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.48 to $3.58. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 543 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27% in the second half of the year. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes to immigration or tax policies. With that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Thank you, Bryan. Yeah. So I think -- and so I'll ask Brian to also chime in. But I think from a demand perspective, we're predicting relatively consistent trends as we move into the back part of the year as we saw in Q2. Certainly, as we said on the call, in our prepared remarks, travel and hospitality, retail and consumer goods, we expect will continue to be under significant pressure in the back part of the year. Similarly, we are not expecting any significant recovery in Financial Services, whether that be either banking or insurance. But I do think Healthcare, certainly, we continue to expect some improvement in Healthcare as we get into the back part of the year. We had talked earlier in Q1, obviously, that in Q2, barring what happened with COVID and the ransomware that the Healthcare payer business would have started to get stronger, and certainly we've seen strengthening in their pipeline. And then we would expect to see continued good growth from our manlog sort of manufacturing, energy and utilities business as well as life sciences and the tech business once you back out the content services business. So I think really generally speaking, the same trends that we've seen in recent months. So I can take that, Ed, and then Brian can chime in about the future. But first of all, thank you for the nice comment. Inorganic revenue in the quarter was about two points, but Collaborative, as you know, didn't close until late in the quarter, so very small contribution in the quarter. We have not broken out the full year revenue from Collaborative, but obviously, that is baked into our guidance for the remainder of the year. And New Signature, again, we've signed it, but we have not closed and do not expect to close until later this quarter. So in terms of the back half of the year, we'll will have a very small immaterial impact on revenue. But Brian, perhaps, you want to talk about acquisitions going forward. Sure. Thanks, Brian, and hi, Keith. So I think in terms of how we thought about the second half margin guidance, we said approximately 15% for the full year, which puts the second half at about 15.2%. And if you think about what happened in the first half of the year, Q2 margins came in at 14.1%, and then for the first half we were at 15.2%. As we look forward, and I think about this more sequentially as we get into the back part of the year, obviously the COVID -- any COVID fulfillment issues and the revenue impact from Maze are behind us, but we will continue to have remediation cost as we get into the back part of the year. We have wages and promotions, that as we said, will take place in as effective as of October, so that will certainly put pressure on the Q4 margins. And then obviously, we're not expecting a significant acceleration in revenue based on the guidance that we've provided on a sequential basis. So those are really the biggest pieces of this. And then additionally, obviously, we've got the acquisitions. So anytime we close an acquisition, there are obviously deal costs and integration costs and so forth, which while not individually material, certainly as we look forward sequentially into the back part of the year, just given the timing of the acquisitions, both when Collaborative closed late in Q2 as well as the New Signature deal in the back half of the year will put a little bit of pressure on those margins as we get into the back half of the year."

If you have not, copies are available on our website cognizant.com.The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody.Today, we have several topics to discuss with you as a follow-on to our April 9th business update. These include a review of our first quarter 2020 results, an update on COVID-19, a discussion on the Maze ransomware attack and an update on the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, and how we will react to the new demand environment.Let\u2019s start with first quarter results.Revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.2 billion. This includes a 50 basis points from the exit of certain content services business. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 5% year-over-year. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter.While today's call had a full agenda given COVID-19 and ransomware updates, I do want to start with some perspective on the commercial transformation program that we have been executing over the past year. I\u2019m pleased to state that we've been making solid progress against this initiative, and I want to illustrate this progress with some data that we do not normally share.On a trailing 12-month basis, our win rate is up hundreds of basis points. First quarter total contracts awarded grew 30%-plus year-over-year with broad-based strength across all service lines, industries and geographies. This represents our best quarterly performance since 2017. Qualified pipeline growth was strong in Q1 and especially robust in larger deals where we had solid double digit qualified pipeline growth versus the prior year period. This momentum speaks to how well clients have embraced our strategy and have responded to our renewed sense of client-centricity. It also speaks to how our teams have embraced our focus on growth. Notwithstanding its quarterly earnings backdrop that includes COVID-19 and ransomware, I do not want us to lose sight of these leading indicators that reflect Cognizant\u2019s growing competitiveness.Turning now to COVID-19, which, as you know, is having a severe humanitarian and economic impact on society across the world. As we navigate this pandemic, our top priority remains the health and safety of our own associates while maintaining continuity of service for our clients. Our perspective is that COVID-19 is affecting the IT services industry on two dimensions, fulfillment and demand. Let's start with fulfillment.After a strong start to the first quarter, our revenue slowed meaningfully in March, reflecting the fulfillment challenges are shifting rapidly to a work-from-home environment across our delivery centers. These challenges include people, IT, security and client considerations. Thanks to the professionalism and diligence of our associates and the execution of our crisis management and business continuity plans, we were able to ensure a continuity of service for the vast majority of our clients in March and early April. As a testament to this, I have received numerous notes from clients recognizing the work of our teams. While this was a gargantuan task and there were some speed bumps along the way, I want to acknowledge our teams around the world who went the extra mile in testing circumstances to make this happen.I will return to fulfillment efforts in a moment when I cover the ransomware attack on our internal IT systems and in particular its impact on our work-from-home enablement.The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand is more multidimensional. While we were in a period of great uncertainty, as a company, we expect the economic and human impacts will be felt by companies across the globe. While certain industries will be hit hardest, all industries will suffer. Smaller businesses and those with weak balance sheet and liquidity will be particularly impacted. The demand impact will be felt throughout 2020. And when a recovery materializes, certain markets, such as the U.S., will rebound quicker.As indicated on our April 9th update, we've seen some delays in cancellations of projects and discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients.While our outlook for 2020 has been meaningfully altered, we are nevertheless confident that we will weather the storm, given our business mix. For example, since more than 60% of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, we are less exposed to some of the hardest hit industries, including travel, hospitality, retail and automotive. International markets, which tend to rebound more slowly, represent just 25% of our business. And, we are primarily exposed to global 2000 clients which we believe will be more resilient than smaller companies. We also have great confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity. While we will be prudent in this uncertain economic backdrop, this confidence allows us nonetheless to invest in M&A to accelerate our strategy and bolster our capabilities. More on that later.More broadly, the pandemic shockwaves have spurred clients to accelerate their digital transformation. Clients are looking for ways to modernize their business, accelerate innovation, become more elastic and agile in the face of business uncertainty, and generally, reimagine their businesses for the new normal. More major IT trends such as core modernization, data modernization and cloud adoption will accelerate. These secular trends play to our refined strategy and make us more relevant than ever.In short, while 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we\u2019re confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix, our balance sheet, our momentum in our digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will allow us to compete well on a relative basis regardless of the macro environment.Let's turn now to the Maze ransomware attack, which we announced in April. We responded immediately by mobilizing our entire leadership team, drawing on the expertise of our IT and security teams and bringing in leading cybersecurity experts to help us investigate and respond to the attack. We also contacted appropriate law enforcement agencies. From the start, we decided to communicate forthrightly and transparently with our clients. In addition to hundreds of individual client calls conducted by our security organization, cybersecurity experts and our executive team, we held two client conference calls in April.Retaining client trust is of paramount importance. So, we erred on the side of over-communicating the details of what we knew and how we were working to contend or mitigate this incident. We proactively provided clients with Indicators of Compromise or so called IOC, namely forensic data that a company can use to identify potentially malicious activity and defend against attacks from external actors.Earlier this week, in our third conference call with clients, we confirmed the containment of the ransomware attack. While we are pleased to have reached this important milestone, the ransomware attack will nevertheless negatively impact our Q2 results for two reasons. First, the attack encrypted some of our internal systems, effectively disabling them, and we proactively took other systems offline. This disruption included both, select system supporting our work-from-home enablement such as VDI and the provisioning of laptops that have been expected to further increase our work-from-home capabilities in April.Second, in the wake of the ransomware attack, some clients opted to suspend our access to their networks. Billing was therefore impacted for a period of time, yet the cost of staffing these projects remained on our books. With the ransomware attack now contend, we\u2019ve restored VDI in automated laptop provisioning. Further, with previously ordered equipment now physically in India and distribution constraints less respective per the latest state directives, we\u2019re now substantially work-from-home enabled. In addition, following the containment of the ransomware attack, we have meaningfully progressed in addressing the concerns of clients that have suspended our access to their networks. We expect to substantially complete this by the end of the month.We expect the vast majority of revenue and margin impact from the ransomware attack to be in the second quarter. However, ongoing remediation costs will ensue through subsequent quarters. We will disclose the financial impact to you on a quarterly basis to ensure appropriate visibility.Ransomware attacks are becoming all too frequent across industries. We are using this experience as an opportunity to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. We\u2019re already applying what we\u2019ve learned to further harden and strengthen our security environments and we are further leveraging our external security experts to help inform and guide our long-term security strategy. Cybersecurity will continue to be a top priority for us in the years ahead.As you\u2019ll recall, during our COVID-19 business update on April 9th, we withdrew guidance for 2020. Before I pass the call to Karen, I want to draw your attention to the fact that we entered the year with cost assumptions built to support revenue growth acceleration. These assumptions no longer hold true in light of the fact that nobody can predict how long the current macro environment will persist. So, we are faced with a great deal of uncertainty on many levels including our own cost structure.Having come through a challenging 2019 when promotions and salary increases were delayed, as a leadership team, we decided to take a nuance approach to 2020. We aim to invest in the business by protecting and developing digital skills, continuing to build out our commercial team and continuing to correct the employee pyramid by on-boarding approximately 20,000 entry-level hires. Meanwhile, we aim to significantly decrease other costs including corporate overhead, travel, marketing relocations and non-commercial lateral hires.Services companies habitually rely on so-called bench policies to right size their associate base to reflect market demand. Against today\u2019s COVID-19 backdrop, we feel that traditional industry bench policies do not adequately address the interests of impacted employees. Consequently, any employees impacted by demand-supply imbalances may benefit from extended medical coverage and exit packages, through the end of the third quarter.Karen will now take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and cost initiatives. After that, I\u2019ll return to provide some closing remarks before we take Q&A.\nKaren McLoughlin: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.First quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 2.8% year-over-year or 3.5% in constant currency, including a negative 50 basis-point impact from the exit of certain content-related services. We saw strong momentum across the business in January and February with the initial impact of COVID, particularly on the fulfillment side, starting to impact the business in the middle of March.During the first quarter, we also took a fresh look at our definition of digital revenue and have better aligned it to our digital imperatives. Substantive changes to the definition include the addition of certain platform solutions and the removal of certain content services work. Based on this new definition, digital revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was approximately 41% for the first quarter and grew by approximately 19% year-over-year.Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services growth of 1.8% was driven by banking, including strong performance in Europe attributable to the Samlink deal and regional banks in North America. Weakness persisted across global accounts, particularly in capital markets and insurance.Moving on to Healthcare, which grew 2.7%, performance was led by strong double digit growth in life sciences in Europe. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digits as the headwinds in North America, we highlighted in 2019, continued to impact the business in Q1. However, contract signings in Healthcare were a meaningful contributor to the overall strength in bookings that Brian mentioned in his comments.Products and Resources growth of 5.3% was driven by manufacturing, logistics and retail and consumer goods, and partially offset by softness in travel and hospitality. Roughly 60% of this segment represents revenue within the travel and hospitality, and retail and consumer goods industry, which have experienced the earliest impact of COVID-19, given restrictions in travel and lack of foot traffic within retailers.Communications, Media and Technology grew 6.3%, led by strength in communications and media clients in North America, where momentum from late in 2019 continued, driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and the cloud transformation services. However, we expect this vertical to see a meaningful deceleration this year, particularly with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks.Although technology continued to outpace total Company performance, growth decelerated due to a negative impact of $23 million from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This impacted our CMT segment growth by approximately 390 basis points.Moving onto margin. In Q1, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 13.7% and $0.67, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.1%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.96.COVID-related charges were $6 million in the quarter, which included $5 million of the expected $25 million total related to the previously announced onetime salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines.Our GAAP margin improved year-over-year, given the India defined contribution accrual in Q1 of 2019. However, our adjusted operating margin, which excludes this impact in the prior year period, was down 90 basis points year-over-year as investments in sales hiring, higher incentive-based compensation as well as an approximately $30 million to $35 million COVID-related revenue impact in March, resulting from fulfillment challenges, caused by the rapid shift of our employee base to safely work from home. These increased costs were offset by savings from items such as lower T&E and the favorable movement in the rupee.During the quarter, we continued to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q1, we incurred $35 million of charges as part of this plan. Based on the actions taken since the program inception, we have achieved over $250 million in annualized run rate savings.Additionally, as part of the Fit for Growth plan, we continued the exit of a subset of our content services business, accounting for $11 million of the $35 million of charges in the quarter. We continue to expect the ramp-down of this work to occur over the next several quarters with the majority of the work expected to be ramped down exiting 2020.In total, our estimated revenue impact of $225 million to $255 million on an annualized basis is unchanged. In Q2, we expect a negative year-over-year impact to revenue of approximately $50 million. As a reminder, the content services business is within the Communications, Media and Technology segment.Now, I would like to spend some time talking about how we are managing the business in light of an uncertain revenue trajectory and increased costs related to COVID and the ransomware incident.Entering 2020, we had certain demand and revenue assumptions to which we aligned our cost structure. The new reality of the demand environment and the anticipated costs associated with COVID-19 and remediating the ransomware attacks requires us to make further adjustments.Since the trajectory of recovery and demand remains uncertain, we must be prepared for various scenarios over the coming quarters and to manage costs accordingly. As a leadership team, we have spent the last several weeks discussing those scenarios and implementing action plans. In the near term, there will be other COVID-related costs which we will continue to identify separately, including the remaining $20 million of the $25 million related to the one-time salary adjustment in April for certain employees in India and the Philippines, cost to establish work-from-home environments for employees. Additionally, part of planning as a leadership team is to contemplate the future workplace environment and be prepared to return our employees safely to this new reality. It is likely that there will be incremental costs in the near term as we prepare to exit the lockdown periods. These costs could include not only equipping certain employees to work from home on a more permanent basis, but also retrofitting existing facilities to accommodate a lower density ratio amid new social distancing norms and other business continuity-related costs.As we think about mitigation efforts, our near-term focus is on first addressing variable costs. We are a people-based business. And employee-related costs including compensation and benefits plus subcontractors make up over 80% of our total cost structure. We are ratcheting down variable cost, both people and non-people-related costs through actions such as reduced T&E, relocation, recruiting and immigration-related costs, reduced spend on events and marketing, prudently managing our subcontractor mix, deferring certain annual wage increases and promotion cycles. We are freezing lateral hiring across all functions. However, we will continue to move forward with our sales hiring plan and other key positions and honor all outstanding accepted offers. Deferring the timing of our trainee start date in India to Q3 from Q2. However, this will continue to be dependent on lockdowns and school schedules across India.I believe managing utilization is another way that we will more closely align with a lower revenue trajectory. As you might imagine, we have seen a significant decline in voluntary attrition in recent weeks. This, when compounded by a reduction in demand, will naturally lead to utilization levels lower than what we believe is necessary to support the business in the near term. In this scenario, we will accelerate the further development of employees with skills aligned to our key digital imperatives, which we expect will align with client demand when an economic recovery emerges.At the same time, we are aware that there are likely to be employees who are or will become unutilized for whom we do not foresee those opportunities. As always, we are committed to treating these employees with fairness and dignity, which in the current environment will also include providing extended health and other financial benefits to ease their transition.Accordingly, between now and the end of the third quarter, we expect to incur additional realignment charges associated with these enhanced benefits, and we now expect net headcount to decline in 2020 versus 2019. The size and timing of these charges will unfold as the demand environment becomes clearer.It is also critical in this environment to continue to execute our Fit for Growth plan, which thus far has not experienced any material delays from COVID. We still expect the majority of the actions to be complete by the middle of this year and result in gross savings of over $450 million in 2020 and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021. We continue to expect charges to be in the $150 million to $200 million range.Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of March 31st stood at $4.3 billion, up approximately $860 million from December 31st. This balance now excludes the approximately $400 million of restricted deposits related to our tax dispute in India, which has been reclassified as long-term investment on our balance sheet.We further strengthened our financial flexibility by drawing down $1.74 billion on our revolving credit facility on March 23, 2020. This brought our outstanding debt balance to $2.5 billion. Additionally, we have paused our share repurchase activity as our focus will be on targeted M&A and preserving liquidity. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business while continuing to invest.We generated $385 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 74 days improved 2 days year-over-year, reflecting improved collections from several large accounts. On a year-over-year basis, free cash flow also benefited from lower incentive-based compensation, which was paid out in the first quarter. In addition, restructuring charges resulted in approximately a $50 million cash outflow in the quarter, although this was mostly offset by onetime items as a result of certain favorable contract negotiations.We do anticipate an increase in DSO for the remainder of 2020 as we have granted certain clients, in significantly impacted industries, extended payment terms for a short defined period. As we have seen in prior downturns, standing by our clients in times of trouble serves us well in protecting the overall partnership. At the same time, we are also reviewing our own vendor relationship and will continue to pursue opportunities to drive both, cost and cash flow efficiencies.As we discussed during our business update call on April 9th, given the limited visibility in our markets, we do not feel it is appropriate to offer either Q2 or full year 2020 guidance. While we are not able to predict with any certainty the length of disruption or depth of the economic impacts from COVID-19, we are operating the business with the following assumptions.First that the demand environment remains highly volatile and uncertain in the near term. We expect client focus in the near term to be on critical systems and infrastructure to enable their core operations. Discretionary projects or those without a quick payback we expect will be delayed. We see this significantly challenging the second quarter but also the remainder of the year.We are currently planning for a slow transition back to normalcy and expect year-over-year challenges to continue, at least through Q1 2021. We expect the demand will be most impacted in travel, hospitality, retail, automotive, energy and media and entertainment, which are collectively just over 20% of total revenue, but we do also anticipate a broad slowdown across our other industries.As Brian mentioned, the ransomware attack in April negatively impacted our work-from-home enablement schedule. As a result of this ransomware attack, our Q2 revenue and margins will both be negatively impacted. While we anticipate that the revenue impact related to this issue will be largely resolved by the middle of the quarter, we do anticipate the revenue and corresponding margin impact to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million for the quarter. Additionally, we expect to incur certain legal, consulting and other costs associated with the investigation, service restoration and remediation of the breach.While we have restored the majority of our services and we are moving quickly to complete the investigation, it is likely that costs related to the ransomware attack will continue to negatively impact our financial results beyond Q2. While we have already begun taking action to address costs across the Company, there is a lag on the timing of any savings from these actions. Therefore, we expect adjusted margins to decline sequentially and remain below the 16% to 17% range provided in our February guidance, which we have since withdrawn on a full-year basis. We anticipate that our Q2 adjusted operating margin will be the lowest quarter of the year, given the combined impact of COVID-19 and the ransomware attack.So, to wrap up, while COVID-19 and the ransomware attack will negatively impact our 2020 financial performance, we are very-pleased with the progress we are making, not just for the cost alignment part of our Fit for Growth program but also the continued progress we have made with hiring new sales resources and the traction we have seen in win rates and first quarter total contract signings. We look forward to providing you with further updates as the year progresses.With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian to further discuss our recovery plan in a post-COVID world.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Karen.Let me wrap up by saying that Cognizant is built on financial strength and flexibility, unwavering client-centricity that has earned the enduring trust of clients and 290,000 talented associates who once again proved a great selflessness and determination in recent weeks. While 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we are confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix and our balance sheet, our momentum in a digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will enable us to compete well on a relative basis, regardless of the macro environment.The post-COVID world will create new norms and hasting trends to highly mobile, virtual and personal world. We won't just be talking about teleworking but rather remote everything from digital workflow, to design, to e-commerce, e-banking, education and telemedicine.Against this backdrop, our strategy to win in the digital battleground with AI and analytics, digital engineering, cloud and IoT become more relevant than ever. We will continue to use M&A to accelerate the execution of our strategy. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its rich expertise and leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions will expand our opportunity in cloud by establishing a neat practice in this large, fast-growing market.The acquisition brings key skills to Cognizant and differentiates us in the market, especially against Indian pure-play competitors. The acquisition also compliments the capabilities we've been building out in our sales force practice.We\u2019ve come through a lot so far this year. Through this, we\u2019ve always sustained our focus on our client-centricity and our determination to execute our strategy. Our increased commercial momentum in the first quarter affirms that our strategy, our solution portfolio, and our renewed vigor is resonating well with clients. While the COVID-19 and the recent ransomware attack have been a setback, I\u2019m confident that Cognizant will emerge strongly from these challenges.Of course, no one knows how long the pandemic will last, only that eventually will fade, certainly the business world will be quite different from what it is today. I've been here long enough at Cognizant to know that we will rise and surmount this challenge and come out the other side stronger. We'll keep our culture strong through this period, the spirit of teamwork and collaboration on the vast scale that I've seen from our associates during the crisis are I believe the direct result of our Company\u2019s deep-seated and shared sense of purpose. Come what may, it's in our DNA to help our clients succeed.And with that, operator, we can open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and good to hear your voices. Brian, thanks for the visibility on some of those sales metrics in the first quarter. You highlighted the 30% increase in total contracts awarded. You've made a number of changes to Cognizant's go-to-market model since you joined Cognizant. Can you highlight what changes have been making this difference or driving this early traction you're seeing? How far along are you on this journey? And are there particular service lines or project types where you're seeing particular traction at this point? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Hi, Lisa. So, look, we made a significant amount of changes from a go-to-market point of view in the last year. But, it really kicked in Q1 of this year, because a lot of work was needed before we could actually determine how to best deploy this. And that included a different sales compensation model, which shifted more compensation to variable comp away from fixed compensation. It included a resegmentation of clients into a RAD model, which is a sophisticated methodology to deploy resources against accounts that you are currently in or you're trying to farm versus hunt, new logos. It also required us to build out extensive new relationships with partners, who need to become very much part of our ecosystem. And on top of that, of course, we have been in the process of hiring 500-revenue-generating resources and/or supporting resources, which could include commercial pricers, lawyers, et cetera. We're about 60% through that.But, let's not overlook the fact as well. Just the notion of getting the Company back focused on growth, focused on client-centricity and getting the vigor back into the Company to tap into something that fundamentally is in our core D&A is very, very important. We've been doing that for a period of time now. We've also made some leadership changes. We've really tried to hone in on client-centricity in the leadership team, starting with myself. And that's what I believe has led to the significant momentum we've had in the first quarter. And I would say, even for some of our larger industries like insurance, banking, healthcare, that momentum was actually continued into the month of April, albeit not at the really robust strength that we saw in the first quarter. But, the 33% growth in the first quarter is our strongest bookings since 2017. It was actually very broad-based across all industry segments, across North America as well as our international markets, which we term global growth markets.And then, from a service line point of view, our digital business was up in excess of 50% and digital operations. And our third service line, systems and technology also had robust growth.And I really feel good by the way about our digital offerings. We have really strong capabilities now in cloud. You've seen us build out capabilities with a series of acquisitions in the last year, three sales force platinum partners, and more recently this week, Collaborative Solutions, which is the establishment of a workday practice in Cognizant. Sales force and the workday tend to go hand and glove in clients that have embraced cloud. And we feel that a strong alignment behind companies that are growing 20%, 30% year-over-year is obviously very important for Cognizant's growth rate into the future as well.So, I feel very, very good about the commercial momentum and the progress we're making. Now, of course, then we're hit with COVID-19, which fundamentally changed the growth trajectory in the month of March. But, we're going to deal with that. And as I said on the call, we are -- from my perspective as well-positioned as anybody could deal with it, given our business mix and will come out stronger on the other side.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed you\u2019re your question.\nEdward Caso: Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the ransomware attack. So, when did it first appear? Was the takedown of the credit line related to that? And what sort of -- you talked about great awards in Q1. Has this slowed down that favorable TCV momentum? Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. This is Brian. So, the ransomware attack hit us prior to the work-from-home enablement. We saw what was happening, and as we were trying to shut it down, we were faced with therefore a ransomware attack. And we had three calls with clients, two in the month of April and then one last week and where we acknowledged containment. The credit line or the line of credits drawdown had nothing to do with this. This simply gives us optionality. We already have a very-strong balance sheet, as you know, strong collections as Karen\u2019s indicated, in the quarter. So, frankly, it's nothing to do with ransomware.The TCV growth in Q1 was independent of ransomware. I don't believe ransomware had any meaningful impact on our business momentum. Certainly, we had an impact in the month of -- the latter part of April and early May as the ransomware attack had effectively disabled some of our internal systems that have been encrypted, which impacted some of our work-from-home enablement and indeed certain clients had opted, just as an abundance of caution to isolate themselves from our network. But, given we have contained the virus by working night and day candidly internally as well as working with leading cybersecurity partners, including Mandiant and of course the federal authorities. We are now in a better position than clients on a daily basis, are again cleaning this up. So, I think that will be felt from a revenue and margin point of view. For the most part, the vast majority will be felt in Q2. Thereafter, I imagine where we will be half [ph] that.That said, we will continue to spend money in Q3, Q4 and beyond to further strengthen our security framework. So revenue margin impact is more in Q2, cost impact will continue a little bit through the rest of the year.But, Ed, I think we handled the ransomware attack as well as one can in these circumstances. We chose to be very deliberately client-centric by having three clients conference calls, by doing hundreds of client calls with the executive team and our security team and indeed Mandiant, and this [ph] throughout this period by being as forthright and as transparent as we possibly could. And nobody wants to be dealt with a ransomware attack. I personally don't believe anybody is truly impervious to it, but the difference is how you manage it. And we tried to manage it professionally and maturely.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Good afternoon. Thank you. I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to ask on client behavior. Really, just what you're seeing over the last two weeks versus the spending appetite in early and mid-April? And any semblance of stabilization in any verticals yet? And can you just comment on the types of programs that are moving forward?\nBrian Humphries: Hey, Bryan. I don't think there's any stabilization per se. Budgets, from my perspective, wear being revised downwards throughout all industries. Certainly, some industries will be hit more than others. I think, digital remains a priority. Virtual work, virtual healthcare, education, banking, e-commerce, you name it, remains of course top of mind for people in today's environment. The shift to SaaS continues. Digital engineering continues, by definition, to fuel some of those capabilities. But, I would say, projects, the short-term paybacks continue. But anything that is deemed discretionary is being delayed. We have seen some requests for furloughs, rate concessions, et cetera, but not a meaningful amount.I would say, in the same vein, we are still seeing some pretty substantial opportunities there, including captive opportunities. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, pipeline shape on a qualified basis actually looked reasonably healthy as we exited Q1, and even now after the month of March.So, we are being very opportunistic here. We are making sure we fine tune our offerings to take advantage of the new norm that we're in today. We have work streams lined up behind that. And of course, we continue to push our digital imperatives, which are from my perspective firmly and squarely into the area of the market where growth will continue, if not accelerate into the foreseeable future. And that includes data modernization, cloud, applications generally including SaaS and indeed, core modernization. So, we feel well positioned. But, it's particularly difficult environment call at this moment in time. There's not a lot of visibility and clients are, I think obviously being cautious.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien-tsin Huang: I have a follow-up and then a question. A follow-up to Lisa\u2019s question, just on the sales signing success. Are you seeing an uptick in sole source deals given your investments in sales? Obviously, the win share is up against the bigger pipeline, but it sounds like maybe the sole sourced piece could be up. Just curious on that. And then just, it sounds like, Brian, your M&A appetite is still there. Should we expect a pause, given everything going on or are you still pretty active with the M&A? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: I don't think we see a lot of sole source per se, but I will say we have seen some renewals where we've had the opportunity to renew without those contracts being up for a bid or tender. And that's been on the basis of very strong deliveries and strong client satisfaction, and frankly a very-strong executive engagement, which has been quite intentional over the last year. But, as ever, clients are always looking to extract value for money and of course they also wants to sleep well at night. So, they want to work with partners who honor their commitments and deliver well.I\u2019m feeling good generally, however, about our momentum in the field and our competitive positioning. Our win rates are improving, as I said. Our contracts bookings speak for themselves. If it was one vertical or one service line, I wouldn't quite be so adamant about this. But, I genuinely feel as that we've made tremendous progress in the last year.From an M&A perspective, I\u2019m fortunate to be backed by a Board who are very supportive of the project we're undergoing. We have a clearly defined strategy. The M&A transactions that we have made in the last year have been against a defined strategy that was blessed by the Board last September. We will continue to obviously monitor collections and monitor our liquidity as well as our balance sheet. But, we feel very comfortable in our current position. And I will say, we will continue to conduct M&A transactions, albeit in a prudent manner. We want to conduct transactions that solely fit and are squarely aligned to our strategy and that we have confidence that we have the right leadership team in place to integrate them successfully.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. And, Brian, congratulations on a good March. It seems pretty clear in the absence of COVID that Cognizant was on a very good path for 2020. My question is, I want to dig a little bit in at least around some context associated with margins over the next couple of quarters, and what the puts and takes are. You mentioned that Cognizant is on a journey to invest, including the sales reps that you mentioned. Karen listed a number of things that were incremental -- sounds like incremental cost savings. And I just wondered is the way to think about the dollar amount of incremental cost savings associated with those new areas since the advent of COVID, just so if we can at least try to think about where the margins might be in turn? Part B of that is, as you think about the malware situation, will those costs for remediation, will those be non-GAAP item? In other words, would those be GAAP charges but would be taken out of the non-GAAP results? And that's it. I mean, just any other comments, Brian, on how we should be thinking about margins for the next two quarters in particular?\nBrian Humphries: So, Keith, I'll kick it off and then maybe Karen can jump in, if it\u2019s okay, Karen. We're obviously not in the same location today. Keith, thank you. First of all, I do feel that we did have momentum that was building as we exited Q4. January and February were particularly strong. I felt we were on track to have a very strong quarter relative to Wall Street expectations. And then, of course, March arrived with COVID.As Karen will attest, the change in dynamics was relatively abrupt. Obviously because first and foremost because of fulfillment where in countries like India, we had four hours. We had obviously triggered a business continuity plan weeks ahead. But the ultimate decision to lockdown India came with a four-hour notice. So, we -- like many services companies, I imagine we're scrambling to fulfill work-from-home capabilities via encrypted desktops or laptops or remote VDI, et cetera. So that hurt us from a fulfillment point of view. And as such you have costs, but add the revenue. Similarly, that's compounded itself in the first few weeks of May and the last few weeks of April yet again, not only were we dealing with COVID, but then we had a ransomware attack that encrypted servers, which actually took out some of the work-from-home capabilities that we had enabled in the prior weeks, and also slowed our ability to enable further work-from-home because of some of the systems and tools we would have used to automate and provision laptops were no longer functioning.So, we had the perfect storm in which we still had costs without revenue. And on top of that when you have clients who disconnect you from their network for a period of time until such time as you're contained the malware, yet again, you want to keep those skillets ready to reengage as soon as the clients permit you to reengage.So, I think, what you'll find in Q2, we had the perfect storm of cost without revenue, and of course then you have to adjust to reflect the demand-supply imbalance. And that is ultimately I think what will hurt our margins in the foreseeable future. And then, as Karen will tell you, of course, we want to protect skills like digital skills, and of course therefore we want to take out any so-called no-regrets costs to try to mitigate that. But Karen will give you a little bit more details.\nKaren McLoughlin: Sure. Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Keith. In terms of the ransomware question that you asked, we will not be adjusting that out of our non-GAAP. Those costs will stay both in our GAAP and our non-GAAP margins as they continue through the rest of the year. We will, however, as we've done in the past with some other large unusual transactions, try to call those out on a quarterly basis, if they're meaningful, so that investors will see what that cost looks like.And as Brian said on the margin side, obviously, there are a number of things that happened very quickly and where we can move to take cost or cost gets eliminated or doesn't happen such as T&E and so forth, which like others, we started to see the benefits of in late March. Obviously, because people aren't physically at work at clients' sites, they're not relocating and we don't have to worry about immigration and other things as people are moving around the country and so forth.And then, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we will continue to honor all of the outstanding offers that have been accepted, we have, for the most part, shut down much of our hiring. And so, recruiting costs obviously go away along with that. But, I think, as we've talked about, in this business, obviously, when there is a revenue slowdown, it depends what the cause of that revenue is as to what happens to your resources and your utilization rates.As Brian talked about, with things that we think are short-term, such as we had with the fulfillment, challenges with COVID late-March, early-April and then more recently with the ransomware, clearly we want to hold onto those resources, so that they can continue to deliver services to clients as that work comes back up. And we certainly want to make sure through this time that we protect our digital skills and use this opportunity to continue to enhance and develop digital skills across the Company. But certainly, it is not unlikely that utilization will hit levels below where we think they should be to run the business for the foreseeable future. And then, obviously, we'll have to make some adjustments and modify the headcounts accordingly for the organization.As we said, we don't expect to be in the margin range that we had previously guided to back in February. We do think margins will be below the 16% to 17% range for the year and for each of the quarters throughout the year. And we would expect the Q2 because of the issues with ransomware will be the lowest quarter of the year. But, we will remain on track with our Fit for Growth plan. We have made good progress through the first quarter and have generated between Q4 and the first quarter this year over $250 million of annual savings already, and we'll be on track for the $450 million as we go through the rest of the year to begin to set ourselves up as we move into 2021.\nBrian Humphries: Just to conclude at this point, I felt as though very much the story was on track. The commercial momentum started to build, the Fit for Growth was well on track. And I would say, then we suffered a micro event, which is our ransomware attack, which we have dealt with since. And then, of course we're faced with a macro environment because of COVID-19. In the absence of those, I would say, the story remains very much consistent with what we've been saying for the last year, which is differentiating between a cost versus an investment, trying to pivot the Company back towards a growth story and making sure we have a refined strategy that we can invest on and execute well to unlock more shareholder value creation. And that certainly will be the playbook we will go back to. And I'd like to think we\u2019ll come out of this storm well, given the business mix, given our balance sheet, given our liquidity and with even a leaner cost structure, given the environment we're going through in the meantime. Hopefully, we can continue the commercial momentum, at least on a relative basis and then, come out of this strongly.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRod Bourgeois: So, the payers subsegment of your Healthcare vertical has been weak for a good while, while the life sciences subsegment has been strong. We actually entered 2020 thinking this is the first time in a while that you could be in a better place to grow the payer subsegment of your Healthcare vertical. So, my question is, looking beyond the immediate crisis on a more secular basis, are you starting to see opportunities for better relative growth in the payer subsegment or maybe you were seeing better opportunities and now COVID is making that murky. But, I'd like to ask for any color on that if you can. Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Look, we had an outstanding first quarter in Healthcare from a bookings point of view, triple-digit growth. By the way, we also had growth into the month of April on a year-over-year basis as well. And I've been particularly pleased to see the direct wins we have seen in the payer area, but also frankly even in the provider area. So, it feels to me that we were starting to turn a corner in Healthcare. And as you know, once we hit Q2, we will anniversary the tougher compares that we hit last year because of some of the consolidation in the industry. So, we still have work to do, of course, to continue to sharpen our pencils on our strategy. But, I feel as though we have made very good progress. We have a leadership team that's very engaged, and we seem to have growing momentum with our major clients.\nRod Bourgeois: Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Okay. I think with that we will take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, Brian. That is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is Jonathan on for James. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I want to ask about what you're seeing on the work that's being canceled versus the type of work that's being deferred. Are you seeing a difference in that type of work? I know discretionary work is off the table. But, can you help dimensionalize relative to your service lines, what's being considered discretionary now?\nBrian Humphries: Look, it\u2019s highly nuanced; it\u2019s client by client, but I would say things that have a long payback, tend to be pushed out at this moment in time, some change requests or anything that's so called discretionary that's not being critical is certainly being pushed. But, we have seen good momentum, as I said in our digital engineering business, we feel very good about our cloud momentum. And actually we've had great receptivity to this week's announced acquisition of Collaborative Solutions. So, I think that the fact that the core elements of the secular trends that have been in the market from my perspective, will accelerate as clients strikes, you have a much more agile, modern infrastructure, and ultimately try to take advantage of the data that they have accumulated over the years to really try to have a much more modern perspective in terms of how to think about individuals. And I truly believe we're moving to a mobile, a virtual, and a truly personal world on a go forward basis.Okay. I think with that we\u2019re at the top of the hour. So, I'd just like to thank you for joining. I know it was a complex earnings call, because not only did we talk about the Q1 results, we also touched upon the COVID-19 implications, the ransomware attack and how we've dealt with that and a little lens into the future.I would just want to wrap up by saying the following things. I truly feel as though we're more competitive than we have been as evidenced by win rates, as evidenced by our pipeline growth, as evidenced by 33% bookings, our highest momentum since 2017. Yes, it is true that COVID brings a great deal of uncertainty, but I believe our business mix and indeed our growing competitiveness will help us on a relative basis come what may. Ransomware attack is regrettable. It is contained. I believe we've managed it well. We've had good client feedback. We've been transparent. We were forthright. The impact is on revenue and margin primarily in Q2. There will be some residual costs that we will incur in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to harden and strengthen our security position, and that is an absolute no-regret spend. Fundamentally, our strategy is sound, it resonates with clients and you're seeing that show up now in our numbers. And last but not least, we're 100% focused on executing that strategy. And our client-centricity is greater than ever and we expect to accelerate out of the corner once we got through COVID-19.So, with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody.Today, we have several topics to discuss with you as a follow-on to our April 9th business update. These include a review of our first quarter 2020 results, an update on COVID-19, a discussion on the Maze ransomware attack and an update on the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, and how we will react to the new demand environment.Let's start with first quarter results.Revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.2 billion. This includes a 50 basis points from the exit of certain content services business. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 5% year-over-year. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter.While today's call had a full agenda given COVID-19 and ransomware updates, I do want to start with some perspective on the commercial transformation program that we have been executing over the past year. I'm pleased to state that we've been making solid progress against this initiative, and I want to illustrate this progress with some data that we do not normally share.On a trailing 12-month basis, our win rate is up hundreds of basis points. First quarter total contracts awarded grew 30%-plus year-over-year with broad-based strength across all service lines, industries and geographies. This represents our best quarterly performance since 2017. Qualified pipeline growth was strong in Q1 and especially robust in larger deals where we had solid double digit qualified pipeline growth versus the prior year period. This momentum speaks to how well clients have embraced our strategy and have responded to our renewed sense of client-centricity. It also speaks to how our teams have embraced our focus on growth. Notwithstanding its quarterly earnings backdrop that includes COVID-19 and ransomware, I do not want us to lose sight of these leading indicators that reflect Cognizant's growing competitiveness.Turning now to COVID-19, which, as you know, is having a severe humanitarian and economic impact on society across the world. As we navigate this pandemic, our top priority remains the health and safety of our own associates while maintaining continuity of service for our clients. Our perspective is that COVID-19 is affecting the IT services industry on two dimensions, fulfillment and demand. Let's start with fulfillment.After a strong start to the first quarter, our revenue slowed meaningfully in March, reflecting the fulfillment challenges are shifting rapidly to a work-from-home environment across our delivery centers. These challenges include people, IT, security and client considerations. Thanks to the professionalism and diligence of our associates and the execution of our crisis management and business continuity plans, we were able to ensure a continuity of service for the vast majority of our clients in March and early April. As a testament to this, I have received numerous notes from clients recognizing the work of our teams. While this was a gargantuan task and there were some speed bumps along the way, I want to acknowledge our teams around the world who went the extra mile in testing circumstances to make this happen.I will return to fulfillment efforts in a moment when I cover the ransomware attack on our internal IT systems and in particular its impact on our work-from-home enablement.The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand is more multidimensional. While we were in a period of great uncertainty, as a company, we expect the economic and human impacts will be felt by companies across the globe. While certain industries will be hit hardest, all industries will suffer. Smaller businesses and those with weak balance sheet and liquidity will be particularly impacted. The demand impact will be felt throughout 2020. And when a recovery materializes, certain markets, such as the U.S., will rebound quicker.As indicated on our April 9th update, we've seen some delays in cancellations of projects and discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients.While our outlook for 2020 has been meaningfully altered, we are nevertheless confident that we will weather the storm, given our business mix. For example, since more than 60% of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, we are less exposed to some of the hardest hit industries, including travel, hospitality, retail and automotive. International markets, which tend to rebound more slowly, represent just 25% of our business. And, we are primarily exposed to global 2000 clients which we believe will be more resilient than smaller companies. We also have great confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity. While we will be prudent in this uncertain economic backdrop, this confidence allows us nonetheless to invest in M&A to accelerate our strategy and bolster our capabilities. More on that later.More broadly, the pandemic shockwaves have spurred clients to accelerate their digital transformation. Clients are looking for ways to modernize their business, accelerate innovation, become more elastic and agile in the face of business uncertainty, and generally, reimagine their businesses for the new normal. More major IT trends such as core modernization, data modernization and cloud adoption will accelerate. These secular trends play to our refined strategy and make us more relevant than ever.In short, while 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we're confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix, our balance sheet, our momentum in our digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will allow us to compete well on a relative basis regardless of the macro environment.Let's turn now to the Maze ransomware attack, which we announced in April. We responded immediately by mobilizing our entire leadership team, drawing on the expertise of our IT and security teams and bringing in leading cybersecurity experts to help us investigate and respond to the attack. We also contacted appropriate law enforcement agencies. From the start, we decided to communicate forthrightly and transparently with our clients. In addition to hundreds of individual client calls conducted by our security organization, cybersecurity experts and our executive team, we held two client conference calls in April.Retaining client trust is of paramount importance. So, we erred on the side of over-communicating the details of what we knew and how we were working to contend or mitigate this incident. We proactively provided clients with Indicators of Compromise or so called IOC, namely forensic data that a company can use to identify potentially malicious activity and defend against attacks from external actors.Earlier this week, in our third conference call with clients, we confirmed the containment of the ransomware attack. While we are pleased to have reached this important milestone, the ransomware attack will nevertheless negatively impact our Q2 results for two reasons. First, the attack encrypted some of our internal systems, effectively disabling them, and we proactively took other systems offline. This disruption included both, select system supporting our work-from-home enablement such as VDI and the provisioning of laptops that have been expected to further increase our work-from-home capabilities in April.Second, in the wake of the ransomware attack, some clients opted to suspend our access to their networks. Billing was therefore impacted for a period of time, yet the cost of staffing these projects remained on our books. With the ransomware attack now contend, we've restored VDI in automated laptop provisioning. Further, with previously ordered equipment now physically in India and distribution constraints less respective per the latest state directives, we're now substantially work-from-home enabled. In addition, following the containment of the ransomware attack, we have meaningfully progressed in addressing the concerns of clients that have suspended our access to their networks. We expect to substantially complete this by the end of the month.We expect the vast majority of revenue and margin impact from the ransomware attack to be in the second quarter. However, ongoing remediation costs will ensue through subsequent quarters. We will disclose the financial impact to you on a quarterly basis to ensure appropriate visibility.Ransomware attacks are becoming all too frequent across industries. We are using this experience as an opportunity to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. We're already applying what we've learned to further harden and strengthen our security environments and we are further leveraging our external security experts to help inform and guide our long-term security strategy. Cybersecurity will continue to be a top priority for us in the years ahead.As you'll recall, during our COVID-19 business update on April 9th, we withdrew guidance for 2020. Before I pass the call to Karen, I want to draw your attention to the fact that we entered the year with cost assumptions built to support revenue growth acceleration. These assumptions no longer hold true in light of the fact that nobody can predict how long the current macro environment will persist. So, we are faced with a great deal of uncertainty on many levels including our own cost structure.Having come through a challenging 2019 when promotions and salary increases were delayed, as a leadership team, we decided to take a nuance approach to 2020. We aim to invest in the business by protecting and developing digital skills, continuing to build out our commercial team and continuing to correct the employee pyramid by on-boarding approximately 20,000 entry-level hires. Meanwhile, we aim to significantly decrease other costs including corporate overhead, travel, marketing relocations and non-commercial lateral hires.Services companies habitually rely on so-called bench policies to right size their associate base to reflect market demand. Against today's COVID-19 backdrop, we feel that traditional industry bench policies do not adequately address the interests of impacted employees. Consequently, any employees impacted by demand-supply imbalances may benefit from extended medical coverage and exit packages, through the end of the third quarter.Karen will now take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and cost initiatives. After that, I'll return to provide some closing remarks before we take Q&A. Thank you, Karen.Let me wrap up by saying that Cognizant is built on financial strength and flexibility, unwavering client-centricity that has earned the enduring trust of clients and 290,000 talented associates who once again proved a great selflessness and determination in recent weeks. While 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we are confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix and our balance sheet, our momentum in a digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will enable us to compete well on a relative basis, regardless of the macro environment.The post-COVID world will create new norms and hasting trends to highly mobile, virtual and personal world. We won't just be talking about teleworking but rather remote everything from digital workflow, to design, to e-commerce, e-banking, education and telemedicine.Against this backdrop, our strategy to win in the digital battleground with AI and analytics, digital engineering, cloud and IoT become more relevant than ever. We will continue to use M&A to accelerate the execution of our strategy. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest workday consultancies. With its rich expertise and leading position in the workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions will expand our opportunity in cloud by establishing a neat practice in this large, fast-growing market.The acquisition brings key skills to Cognizant and differentiates us in the market, especially against Indian pure-play competitors. The acquisition also compliments the capabilities we've been building out in our sales force practice.We've come through a lot so far this year. Through this, we've always sustained our focus on our client-centricity and our determination to execute our strategy. Our increased commercial momentum in the first quarter affirms that our strategy, our solution portfolio, and our renewed vigor is resonating well with clients. While the COVID-19 and the recent ransomware attack have been a setback, I'm confident that Cognizant will emerge strongly from these challenges.Of course, no one knows how long the pandemic will last, only that eventually will fade, certainly the business world will be quite different from what it is today. I've been here long enough at Cognizant to know that we will rise and surmount this challenge and come out the other side stronger. We'll keep our culture strong through this period, the spirit of teamwork and collaboration on the vast scale that I've seen from our associates during the crisis are I believe the direct result of our Company's deep-seated and shared sense of purpose. Come what may, it's in our DNA to help our clients succeed.And with that, operator, we can open the call for questions. Yes. Hi, Lisa. So, look, we made a significant amount of changes from a go-to-market point of view in the last year. But, it really kicked in Q1 of this year, because a lot of work was needed before we could actually determine how to best deploy this. And that included a different sales compensation model, which shifted more compensation to variable comp away from fixed compensation. It included a resegmentation of clients into a RAD model, which is a sophisticated methodology to deploy resources against accounts that you are currently in or you're trying to farm versus hunt, new logos. It also required us to build out extensive new relationships with partners, who need to become very much part of our ecosystem. And on top of that, of course, we have been in the process of hiring 500-revenue-generating resources and/or supporting resources, which could include commercial pricers, lawyers, et cetera. We're about 60% through that.But, let's not overlook the fact as well. Just the notion of getting the Company back focused on growth, focused on client-centricity and getting the vigor back into the Company to tap into something that fundamentally is in our core D&A is very, very important. We've been doing that for a period of time now. We've also made some leadership changes. We've really tried to hone in on client-centricity in the leadership team, starting with myself. And that's what I believe has led to the significant momentum we've had in the first quarter. And I would say, even for some of our larger industries like insurance, banking, healthcare, that momentum was actually continued into the month of April, albeit not at the really robust strength that we saw in the first quarter. But, the 33% growth in the first quarter is our strongest bookings since 2017. It was actually very broad-based across all industry segments, across North America as well as our international markets, which we term global growth markets.And then, from a service line point of view, our digital business was up in excess of 50% and digital operations. And our third service line, systems and technology also had robust growth.And I really feel good by the way about our digital offerings. We have really strong capabilities now in cloud. You've seen us build out capabilities with a series of acquisitions in the last year, three sales force platinum partners, and more recently this week, Collaborative Solutions, which is the establishment of a workday practice in Cognizant. Sales force and the workday tend to go hand and glove in clients that have embraced cloud. And we feel that a strong alignment behind companies that are growing 20%, 30% year-over-year is obviously very important for Cognizant's growth rate into the future as well.So, I feel very, very good about the commercial momentum and the progress we're making. Now, of course, then we're hit with COVID-19, which fundamentally changed the growth trajectory in the month of March. But, we're going to deal with that. And as I said on the call, we are -- from my perspective as well-positioned as anybody could deal with it, given our business mix and will come out stronger on the other side. Yes. This is Brian. So, the ransomware attack hit us prior to the work-from-home enablement. We saw what was happening, and as we were trying to shut it down, we were faced with therefore a ransomware attack. And we had three calls with clients, two in the month of April and then one last week and where we acknowledged containment. The credit line or the line of credits drawdown had nothing to do with this. This simply gives us optionality. We already have a very-strong balance sheet, as you know, strong collections as Karen's indicated, in the quarter. So, frankly, it's nothing to do with ransomware.The TCV growth in Q1 was independent of ransomware. I don't believe ransomware had any meaningful impact on our business momentum. Certainly, we had an impact in the month of -- the latter part of April and early May as the ransomware attack had effectively disabled some of our internal systems that have been encrypted, which impacted some of our work-from-home enablement and indeed certain clients had opted, just as an abundance of caution to isolate themselves from our network. But, given we have contained the virus by working night and day candidly internally as well as working with leading cybersecurity partners, including Mandiant and of course the federal authorities. We are now in a better position than clients on a daily basis, are again cleaning this up. So, I think that will be felt from a revenue and margin point of view. For the most part, the vast majority will be felt in Q2. Thereafter, I imagine where we will be half [ph] that.That said, we will continue to spend money in Q3, Q4 and beyond to further strengthen our security framework. So revenue margin impact is more in Q2, cost impact will continue a little bit through the rest of the year.But, Ed, I think we handled the ransomware attack as well as one can in these circumstances. We chose to be very deliberately client-centric by having three clients conference calls, by doing hundreds of client calls with the executive team and our security team and indeed Mandiant, and this [ph] throughout this period by being as forthright and as transparent as we possibly could. And nobody wants to be dealt with a ransomware attack. I personally don't believe anybody is truly impervious to it, but the difference is how you manage it. And we tried to manage it professionally and maturely. Hey, Bryan. I don't think there's any stabilization per se. Budgets, from my perspective, wear being revised downwards throughout all industries. Certainly, some industries will be hit more than others. I think, digital remains a priority. Virtual work, virtual healthcare, education, banking, e-commerce, you name it, remains of course top of mind for people in today's environment. The shift to SaaS continues. Digital engineering continues, by definition, to fuel some of those capabilities. But, I would say, projects, the short-term paybacks continue. But anything that is deemed discretionary is being delayed. We have seen some requests for furloughs, rate concessions, et cetera, but not a meaningful amount.I would say, in the same vein, we are still seeing some pretty substantial opportunities there, including captive opportunities. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, pipeline shape on a qualified basis actually looked reasonably healthy as we exited Q1, and even now after the month of March.So, we are being very opportunistic here. We are making sure we fine tune our offerings to take advantage of the new norm that we're in today. We have work streams lined up behind that. And of course, we continue to push our digital imperatives, which are from my perspective firmly and squarely into the area of the market where growth will continue, if not accelerate into the foreseeable future. And that includes data modernization, cloud, applications generally including SaaS and indeed, core modernization. So, we feel well positioned. But, it's particularly difficult environment call at this moment in time. There's not a lot of visibility and clients are, I think obviously being cautious. I don't think we see a lot of sole source per se, but I will say we have seen some renewals where we've had the opportunity to renew without those contracts being up for a bid or tender. And that's been on the basis of very strong deliveries and strong client satisfaction, and frankly a very-strong executive engagement, which has been quite intentional over the last year. But, as ever, clients are always looking to extract value for money and of course they also wants to sleep well at night. So, they want to work with partners who honor their commitments and deliver well.I'm feeling good generally, however, about our momentum in the field and our competitive positioning. Our win rates are improving, as I said. Our contracts bookings speak for themselves. If it was one vertical or one service line, I wouldn't quite be so adamant about this. But, I genuinely feel as that we've made tremendous progress in the last year.From an M&A perspective, I'm fortunate to be backed by a Board who are very supportive of the project we're undergoing. We have a clearly defined strategy. The M&A transactions that we have made in the last year have been against a defined strategy that was blessed by the Board last September. We will continue to obviously monitor collections and monitor our liquidity as well as our balance sheet. But, we feel very comfortable in our current position. And I will say, we will continue to conduct M&A transactions, albeit in a prudent manner. We want to conduct transactions that solely fit and are squarely aligned to our strategy and that we have confidence that we have the right leadership team in place to integrate them successfully. So, Keith, I'll kick it off and then maybe Karen can jump in, if it's okay, Karen. We're obviously not in the same location today. Keith, thank you. First of all, I do feel that we did have momentum that was building as we exited Q4. January and February were particularly strong. I felt we were on track to have a very strong quarter relative to Wall Street expectations. And then, of course, March arrived with COVID.As Karen will attest, the change in dynamics was relatively abrupt. Obviously because first and foremost because of fulfillment where in countries like India, we had four hours. We had obviously triggered a business continuity plan weeks ahead. But the ultimate decision to lockdown India came with a four-hour notice. So, we -- like many services companies, I imagine we're scrambling to fulfill work-from-home capabilities via encrypted desktops or laptops or remote VDI, et cetera. So that hurt us from a fulfillment point of view. And as such you have costs, but add the revenue. Similarly, that's compounded itself in the first few weeks of May and the last few weeks of April yet again, not only were we dealing with COVID, but then we had a ransomware attack that encrypted servers, which actually took out some of the work-from-home capabilities that we had enabled in the prior weeks, and also slowed our ability to enable further work-from-home because of some of the systems and tools we would have used to automate and provision laptops were no longer functioning.So, we had the perfect storm in which we still had costs without revenue. And on top of that when you have clients who disconnect you from their network for a period of time until such time as you're contained the malware, yet again, you want to keep those skillets ready to reengage as soon as the clients permit you to reengage.So, I think, what you'll find in Q2, we had the perfect storm of cost without revenue, and of course then you have to adjust to reflect the demand-supply imbalance. And that is ultimately I think what will hurt our margins in the foreseeable future. And then, as Karen will tell you, of course, we want to protect skills like digital skills, and of course therefore we want to take out any so-called no-regrets costs to try to mitigate that. But Karen will give you a little bit more details. Just to conclude at this point, I felt as though very much the story was on track. The commercial momentum started to build, the Fit for Growth was well on track. And I would say, then we suffered a micro event, which is our ransomware attack, which we have dealt with since. And then, of course we're faced with a macro environment because of COVID-19. In the absence of those, I would say, the story remains very much consistent with what we've been saying for the last year, which is differentiating between a cost versus an investment, trying to pivot the Company back towards a growth story and making sure we have a refined strategy that we can invest on and execute well to unlock more shareholder value creation. And that certainly will be the playbook we will go back to. And I'd like to think we'll come out of this storm well, given the business mix, given our balance sheet, given our liquidity and with even a leaner cost structure, given the environment we're going through in the meantime. Hopefully, we can continue the commercial momentum, at least on a relative basis and then, come out of this strongly. Look, we had an outstanding first quarter in Healthcare from a bookings point of view, triple-digit growth. By the way, we also had growth into the month of April on a year-over-year basis as well. And I've been particularly pleased to see the direct wins we have seen in the payer area, but also frankly even in the provider area. So, it feels to me that we were starting to turn a corner in Healthcare. And as you know, once we hit Q2, we will anniversary the tougher compares that we hit last year because of some of the consolidation in the industry. So, we still have work to do, of course, to continue to sharpen our pencils on our strategy. But, I feel as though we have made very good progress. We have a leadership team that's very engaged, and we seem to have growing momentum with our major clients. Okay. I think with that we will take one more question. Look, it's highly nuanced; it's client by client, but I would say things that have a long payback, tend to be pushed out at this moment in time, some change requests or anything that's so called discretionary that's not being critical is certainly being pushed. But, we have seen good momentum, as I said in our digital engineering business, we feel very good about our cloud momentum. And actually we've had great receptivity to this week's announced acquisition of Collaborative Solutions. So, I think that the fact that the core elements of the secular trends that have been in the market from my perspective, will accelerate as clients strikes, you have a much more agile, modern infrastructure, and ultimately try to take advantage of the data that they have accumulated over the years to really try to have a much more modern perspective in terms of how to think about individuals. And I truly believe we're moving to a mobile, a virtual, and a truly personal world on a go forward basis.Okay. I think with that we're at the top of the hour. So, I'd just like to thank you for joining. I know it was a complex earnings call, because not only did we talk about the Q1 results, we also touched upon the COVID-19 implications, the ransomware attack and how we've dealt with that and a little lens into the future.I would just want to wrap up by saying the following things. I truly feel as though we're more competitive than we have been as evidenced by win rates, as evidenced by our pipeline growth, as evidenced by 33% bookings, our highest momentum since 2017. Yes, it is true that COVID brings a great deal of uncertainty, but I believe our business mix and indeed our growing competitiveness will help us on a relative basis come what may. Ransomware attack is regrettable. It is contained. I believe we've managed it well. We've had good client feedback. We've been transparent. We were forthright. The impact is on revenue and margin primarily in Q2. There will be some residual costs that we will incur in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to harden and strengthen our security position, and that is an absolute no-regret spend. Fundamentally, our strategy is sound, it resonates with clients and you're seeing that show up now in our numbers. And last but not least, we're 100% focused on executing that strategy. And our client-centricity is greater than ever and we expect to accelerate out of the corner once we got through COVID-19.So, with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us."

            "name": "Karen McLoughlin",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.First quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 2.8% year-over-year or 3.5% in constant currency, including a negative 50 basis-point impact from the exit of certain content-related services. We saw strong momentum across the business in January and February with the initial impact of COVID, particularly on the fulfillment side, starting to impact the business in the middle of March.During the first quarter, we also took a fresh look at our definition of digital revenue and have better aligned it to our digital imperatives. Substantive changes to the definition include the addition of certain platform solutions and the removal of certain content services work. Based on this new definition, digital revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was approximately 41% for the first quarter and grew by approximately 19% year-over-year.Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services growth of 1.8% was driven by banking, including strong performance in Europe attributable to the Samlink deal and regional banks in North America. Weakness persisted across global accounts, particularly in capital markets and insurance.Moving on to Healthcare, which grew 2.7%, performance was led by strong double digit growth in life sciences in Europe. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined low single digits as the headwinds in North America, we highlighted in 2019, continued to impact the business in Q1. However, contract signings in Healthcare were a meaningful contributor to the overall strength in bookings that Brian mentioned in his comments.Products and Resources growth of 5.3% was driven by manufacturing, logistics and retail and consumer goods, and partially offset by softness in travel and hospitality. Roughly 60% of this segment represents revenue within the travel and hospitality, and retail and consumer goods industry, which have experienced the earliest impact of COVID-19, given restrictions in travel and lack of foot traffic within retailers.Communications, Media and Technology grew 6.3%, led by strength in communications and media clients in North America, where momentum from late in 2019 continued, driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and the cloud transformation services. However, we expect this vertical to see a meaningful deceleration this year, particularly with entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks.Although technology continued to outpace total Company performance, growth decelerated due to a negative impact of $23 million from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This impacted our CMT segment growth by approximately 390 basis points.Moving onto margin. In Q1, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 13.7% and $0.67, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges, was 15.1%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.96.COVID-related charges were $6 million in the quarter, which included $5 million of the expected $25 million total related to the previously announced onetime salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines.Our GAAP margin improved year-over-year, given the India defined contribution accrual in Q1 of 2019. However, our adjusted operating margin, which excludes this impact in the prior year period, was down 90 basis points year-over-year as investments in sales hiring, higher incentive-based compensation as well as an approximately $30 million to $35 million COVID-related revenue impact in March, resulting from fulfillment challenges, caused by the rapid shift of our employee base to safely work from home. These increased costs were offset by savings from items such as lower T&E and the favorable movement in the rupee.During the quarter, we continued to execute against the 2020 Fit for Growth plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q1, we incurred $35 million of charges as part of this plan. Based on the actions taken since the program inception, we have achieved over $250 million in annualized run rate savings.Additionally, as part of the Fit for Growth plan, we continued the exit of a subset of our content services business, accounting for $11 million of the $35 million of charges in the quarter. We continue to expect the ramp-down of this work to occur over the next several quarters with the majority of the work expected to be ramped down exiting 2020.In total, our estimated revenue impact of $225 million to $255 million on an annualized basis is unchanged. In Q2, we expect a negative year-over-year impact to revenue of approximately $50 million. As a reminder, the content services business is within the Communications, Media and Technology segment.Now, I would like to spend some time talking about how we are managing the business in light of an uncertain revenue trajectory and increased costs related to COVID and the ransomware incident.Entering 2020, we had certain demand and revenue assumptions to which we aligned our cost structure. The new reality of the demand environment and the anticipated costs associated with COVID-19 and remediating the ransomware attacks requires us to make further adjustments.Since the trajectory of recovery and demand remains uncertain, we must be prepared for various scenarios over the coming quarters and to manage costs accordingly. As a leadership team, we have spent the last several weeks discussing those scenarios and implementing action plans. In the near term, there will be other COVID-related costs which we will continue to identify separately, including the remaining $20 million of the $25 million related to the one-time salary adjustment in April for certain employees in India and the Philippines, cost to establish work-from-home environments for employees. Additionally, part of planning as a leadership team is to contemplate the future workplace environment and be prepared to return our employees safely to this new reality. It is likely that there will be incremental costs in the near term as we prepare to exit the lockdown periods. These costs could include not only equipping certain employees to work from home on a more permanent basis, but also retrofitting existing facilities to accommodate a lower density ratio amid new social distancing norms and other business continuity-related costs.As we think about mitigation efforts, our near-term focus is on first addressing variable costs. We are a people-based business. And employee-related costs including compensation and benefits plus subcontractors make up over 80% of our total cost structure. We are ratcheting down variable cost, both people and non-people-related costs through actions such as reduced T&E, relocation, recruiting and immigration-related costs, reduced spend on events and marketing, prudently managing our subcontractor mix, deferring certain annual wage increases and promotion cycles. We are freezing lateral hiring across all functions. However, we will continue to move forward with our sales hiring plan and other key positions and honor all outstanding accepted offers. Deferring the timing of our trainee start date in India to Q3 from Q2. However, this will continue to be dependent on lockdowns and school schedules across India.I believe managing utilization is another way that we will more closely align with a lower revenue trajectory. As you might imagine, we have seen a significant decline in voluntary attrition in recent weeks. This, when compounded by a reduction in demand, will naturally lead to utilization levels lower than what we believe is necessary to support the business in the near term. In this scenario, we will accelerate the further development of employees with skills aligned to our key digital imperatives, which we expect will align with client demand when an economic recovery emerges.At the same time, we are aware that there are likely to be employees who are or will become unutilized for whom we do not foresee those opportunities. As always, we are committed to treating these employees with fairness and dignity, which in the current environment will also include providing extended health and other financial benefits to ease their transition.Accordingly, between now and the end of the third quarter, we expect to incur additional realignment charges associated with these enhanced benefits, and we now expect net headcount to decline in 2020 versus 2019. The size and timing of these charges will unfold as the demand environment becomes clearer.It is also critical in this environment to continue to execute our Fit for Growth plan, which thus far has not experienced any material delays from COVID. We still expect the majority of the actions to be complete by the middle of this year and result in gross savings of over $450 million in 2020 and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021. We continue to expect charges to be in the $150 million to $200 million range.Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of March 31st stood at $4.3 billion, up approximately $860 million from December 31st. This balance now excludes the approximately $400 million of restricted deposits related to our tax dispute in India, which has been reclassified as long-term investment on our balance sheet.We further strengthened our financial flexibility by drawing down $1.74 billion on our revolving credit facility on March 23, 2020. This brought our outstanding debt balance to $2.5 billion. Additionally, we have paused our share repurchase activity as our focus will be on targeted M&A and preserving liquidity. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business while continuing to invest.We generated $385 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 74 days improved 2 days year-over-year, reflecting improved collections from several large accounts. On a year-over-year basis, free cash flow also benefited from lower incentive-based compensation, which was paid out in the first quarter. In addition, restructuring charges resulted in approximately a $50 million cash outflow in the quarter, although this was mostly offset by onetime items as a result of certain favorable contract negotiations.We do anticipate an increase in DSO for the remainder of 2020 as we have granted certain clients, in significantly impacted industries, extended payment terms for a short defined period. As we have seen in prior downturns, standing by our clients in times of trouble serves us well in protecting the overall partnership. At the same time, we are also reviewing our own vendor relationship and will continue to pursue opportunities to drive both, cost and cash flow efficiencies.As we discussed during our business update call on April 9th, given the limited visibility in our markets, we do not feel it is appropriate to offer either Q2 or full year 2020 guidance. While we are not able to predict with any certainty the length of disruption or depth of the economic impacts from COVID-19, we are operating the business with the following assumptions.First that the demand environment remains highly volatile and uncertain in the near term. We expect client focus in the near term to be on critical systems and infrastructure to enable their core operations. Discretionary projects or those without a quick payback we expect will be delayed. We see this significantly challenging the second quarter but also the remainder of the year.We are currently planning for a slow transition back to normalcy and expect year-over-year challenges to continue, at least through Q1 2021. We expect the demand will be most impacted in travel, hospitality, retail, automotive, energy and media and entertainment, which are collectively just over 20% of total revenue, but we do also anticipate a broad slowdown across our other industries.As Brian mentioned, the ransomware attack in April negatively impacted our work-from-home enablement schedule. As a result of this ransomware attack, our Q2 revenue and margins will both be negatively impacted. While we anticipate that the revenue impact related to this issue will be largely resolved by the middle of the quarter, we do anticipate the revenue and corresponding margin impact to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million for the quarter. Additionally, we expect to incur certain legal, consulting and other costs associated with the investigation, service restoration and remediation of the breach.While we have restored the majority of our services and we are moving quickly to complete the investigation, it is likely that costs related to the ransomware attack will continue to negatively impact our financial results beyond Q2. While we have already begun taking action to address costs across the Company, there is a lag on the timing of any savings from these actions. Therefore, we expect adjusted margins to decline sequentially and remain below the 16% to 17% range provided in our February guidance, which we have since withdrawn on a full-year basis. We anticipate that our Q2 adjusted operating margin will be the lowest quarter of the year, given the combined impact of COVID-19 and the ransomware attack.So, to wrap up, while COVID-19 and the ransomware attack will negatively impact our 2020 financial performance, we are very-pleased with the progress we are making, not just for the cost alignment part of our Fit for Growth program but also the continued progress we have made with hiring new sales resources and the traction we have seen in win rates and first quarter total contract signings. We look forward to providing you with further updates as the year progresses.With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian to further discuss our recovery plan in a post-COVID world. Sure. Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Keith. In terms of the ransomware question that you asked, we will not be adjusting that out of our non-GAAP. Those costs will stay both in our GAAP and our non-GAAP margins as they continue through the rest of the year. We will, however, as we've done in the past with some other large unusual transactions, try to call those out on a quarterly basis, if they're meaningful, so that investors will see what that cost looks like.And as Brian said on the margin side, obviously, there are a number of things that happened very quickly and where we can move to take cost or cost gets eliminated or doesn't happen such as T&E and so forth, which like others, we started to see the benefits of in late March. Obviously, because people aren't physically at work at clients' sites, they're not relocating and we don't have to worry about immigration and other things as people are moving around the country and so forth.And then, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we will continue to honor all of the outstanding offers that have been accepted, we have, for the most part, shut down much of our hiring. And so, recruiting costs obviously go away along with that. But, I think, as we've talked about, in this business, obviously, when there is a revenue slowdown, it depends what the cause of that revenue is as to what happens to your resources and your utilization rates.As Brian talked about, with things that we think are short-term, such as we had with the fulfillment, challenges with COVID late-March, early-April and then more recently with the ransomware, clearly we want to hold onto those resources, so that they can continue to deliver services to clients as that work comes back up. And we certainly want to make sure through this time that we protect our digital skills and use this opportunity to continue to enhance and develop digital skills across the Company. But certainly, it is not unlikely that utilization will hit levels below where we think they should be to run the business for the foreseeable future. And then, obviously, we'll have to make some adjustments and modify the headcounts accordingly for the organization.As we said, we don't expect to be in the margin range that we had previously guided to back in February. We do think margins will be below the 16% to 17% range for the year and for each of the quarters throughout the year. And we would expect the Q2 because of the issues with ransomware will be the lowest quarter of the year. But, we will remain on track with our Fit for Growth plan. We have made good progress through the first quarter and have generated between Q4 and the first quarter this year over $250 million of annual savings already, and we'll be on track for the $450 million as we go through the rest of the year to begin to set ourselves up as we move into 2021."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions\u2019 Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today\u2019s call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Throughout 2021, clients have meaningfully accelerated spend on digital transformation initiatives, accelerating the demand for IT services. Elevated attrition in key digital skills is however a direct consequence of this, creating revenue fulfillment challenges and cost pressure that need to be carefully navigated. I am therefore pleased that we had another quarter of solid execution, delivering against our commitments to clients and to you, our shareholders. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, above the high end of our guidance. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 15.3% and full year adjusted operating margin was 15.4% in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we also progressed against our key strategic initiatives, including scaling our digital capabilities, globalizing the company, helping our clients be successful by leading with greater industry insights and solutions and repositioning the Cognizant brand. Turning now to industry segments, our recovery in Financial Services continued with fourth quarter growth of 19% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an approximate 9 percentage point benefit from the impact of the prior year charge related to Samlink. As you know, we have been rebuilding our strength in Financial Services by refreshing our leadership in client-facing teams, strengthening our partner engagement, shifting our portfolio of services to more attractive market segments, and sharpening our focus on priority industry solutions and clients. We expect to build further on this progress in 2022. As we reposition Cognizant as a digital transformation provider in larger banking clients, we have complemented this with sustained momentum in regional banks. KeyBank, where we have just renewed our engagement as their primary digital partner, is a great example of this. We will further enable their digital transformation by digitizing their products to increase their digitally active customers to approximately 85%, by driving remote self-service growth by more than 40%, by automating front-to-back processes, and by migrating more than half of their application portfolio to the cloud. In insurance, we see continued demand for core modernization and digital transformation, including cloud and analytics. Unum, a global leader in disability insurance and group benefits, is partnering with us to pursue their digital transformation focus on agent and customer experiences and associated analytics. These digital solutions enhance our existing application development and maintenance services relationship with Unum. And for a long-time client, Royal London, the UK\u2019s largest mutual life, pensions and investment firm, we are now extending our partnership to reimagine their customer engagement through personalized seamless connected customer journeys enabled by cloud, data and customer-centric principles. In healthcare, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. We have substantially increased our competitiveness in healthcare by investing in digital solutions, domain expertise and partnerships, and by modernizing our core platforms. We have seen continuing momentum in our TriZetto product business, which grew 13% in 2021. We continue to add new footprints and in 2021, increased the number of overall members supported by our platforms to approximately 210 million. We see solid commercial momentum across our healthcare payer and provider business. For instance, Humana, a large national payer is modernizing and moving their legacy ecosystem to the cloud and has chosen Cognizant as a partner for agency, marketing and clinical transformation. These initiatives will help improve Humana\u2019s customer and employee satisfaction, reduce cost, and enhance the delivery of integrated personalized experiences to their members. We also have momentum with next-generation healthcare companies like Reliq Health Technologies, a rapidly growing global telemedicine firm, which turned to us to expand their care management capabilities. Reliq will leverage Cognizant care management services to support the deployment of their care platform across managed care organizations, hospital networks and health insurance providers. In life sciences, we partnered with AbbVie, a leading global biopharma company, to help advance their digital transformation in safety and risk management, which will improve patient care and outcomes. Through our digital health consulting services augmented by capabilities in human-centered design and digital product engineering, AbbVie can understand the needs of patients and care providers, design fit-for-purpose solutions that support the patient journey, and incorporate feedback for ongoing innovation. These improvements will help AbbVie better support patients and care providers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and products. Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Drawing on our extensive experience helping automakers streamlined their operational tasks, Volvo Cars chose us to help harmonize their finance and accounting and procurement processes and implement intelligent process automation to support their digital transformation. This is a great example of our growing momentum in digital business operations, which significantly outpaced the BPO industry in 2021 and is set to continue to gain share. Top line growth has been fueled by momentum in intelligent process automation and strength in our digital-native client portfolio. Our work at Grundfos, a global leader in water technology and the world\u2019s largest pump manufacturer, perfectly illustrates our growing digital credentials. Grundfos initially selected Cognizant to establish an IoT-based intelligent platform to gather real-time pump data from the sensors and perform analytics to prevent, predict and respond to issues caused by leakages. Based on this success, we have since been selected to build a modern enterprise system based on SAP S/4HANA. Finally, in communications, media and technology, we saw continued strength in technology, in particular, where we have sustained strong double-digit growth over the past three quarters. Turning now to bookings, which grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter our second consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth. Full year 2021 bookings growth was in the mid-teens. We entered 2022 with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Throughout the year, our bookings strength, which has been fueled by digital, has been broad-based across industries and geographies. Moving to the macro demand environment, industry demand remains robust and I expect it to continue throughout 2022. Clients are embracing digital operating models to become more efficient, agile, automated, scalable, innovative, and indeed, secure, whilst also responding to the expectations of their customers and employees for hyper personalized experiences. Continuing to scale our digital capabilities is at the heart of our company strategy. Digital represented 45% of our revenue mix in Q4. As we noted during our recent investor briefing, we believe digital can become 55% to 60% of revenue in the coming years. Reflecting our strength in digital credentials, during the fourth quarter, we were named an industry leader in 70 new industry analyst reports. They highlighted the company\u2019s client partnerships, scalability, digital capabilities and expertise as factors in recognizing our leadership. Accelerating digital is not only a driver of double-digit revenue growth and improved margins it also fosters greater client intimacy and higher levels of employee engagement as we partner on strategic transformation projects that leverage advanced skills. Moving on now to an industry phenomenon you are accustomed to hearing about, the unprecedented competition for talent, reflective of the industry-wide demand/supply imbalance in key digital skills. Fourth quarter voluntary attrition moderated a little to 31% on an annualized basis or 28% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO. We have been working aggressively to mitigate attrition levels, whilst intensifying our efforts and focus on employee training, promotion cycles, professional development and total rewards. During 2021, we also facilitated more than 14,000 job moves across 40 countries, continue to revitalize our campus recruitment program in India, establish new compensation measures and a revised promotion cycle to retain employees and invested heavily in upskilling. In fact, our associates completed 23 million hours of learning and consumed 130,000 courses in 2021. Given that we compete on our knowledge and skills, we are proud to have won 42 awards for excellence in learning and development from the Brandon Hall Group, often considered the leading independent HCM research analyst firm. We more than offset elevated attrition levels in 2021 by accelerating our hiring allowing us to increase company headcount by 14%. I am pleased to say that in recent years we have made meaningful progress in correcting our delivery pyramid by significantly increasing the number of college graduate hires onboarded in India. In 2021, we added a record 33,000 college graduate hires in India, up from 17,000 in 2020. In 2022, we plan to add approximately 50,000 in India. Digital acquisitions have also brought incredible talent to Cognizant. During 2021, we completed 7 acquisitions that extend our digital leadership, the most recent being our fourth quarter acquisition of Devbridge. This software consultancy and product development firm expands our software product engineering capabilities and global delivery footprint by adding more than 600 engineers, designers and product managers in Lithuania, Poland, the UK and North America. This extension of our global delivery network complements recent announcements in the United Kingdom, Australia, and indeed, Canada. In closing, I am proud of our execution against our strategy in 2021. We have reestablished commercial momentum and have a healthy book-to-bill ratio. Our delivery teams executed against our commitments despite challenging labor market conditions. Our performance in our two largest industries, Financial Services and Healthcare, has strengthened. Growth in key international markets such as the UK has meaningfully accelerated. Our digital portfolio has been extended and has never been stronger and we have made significant progress in our people strategy, our internal digitization agenda, and indeed, our brand repositioning. For several quarters now, I have been holding our long open-ended virtual sessions with small groups of employees. What I have learned from these intimate sessions as well as from our large virtual townhall meetings is that employee pride in the company is building. Employees see not only how far we have come, but also a clear path to an exciting future. Our employees also recognize the consistent execution of our strategy, our commercial momentum and a commitment to our purpose, vision and values. This purpose has kept us focused on executing our ESG agenda despite distress of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Our ESG-focused commitment is evident in our Cognizant Combat COVID-19 initiative in India, in our intensified efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout Cognizant, in our $250 million philanthropic initiative to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, along with health and well-being in communities around the world and in many other areas covered in our 2021 ESG report. In summary, our broad-based progress allows us to approach the new fiscal year with confidence in our ability to execute against the multiyear financial outlook we presented at our November investor briefing. So with that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. We finished the year with solid momentum, driven by digital projects and entered 2022 with bookings momentum and strong customer demand. For the full year, revenue was $18.5 billion, representing an increase of 11% or 10% at constant currency. This includes 320 basis points contribution from our acquisitions. The charge in Q4 2020 related to the proposed exit from the customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary contributed 70 basis points of growth. I will refer to this as the Samlink impact for the remainder of my remarks. For the full year, digital revenue grew over 19% and represented approximately 44% of total revenue. Q4 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year or 14.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes 280 basis points of the Samlink impact and also 280 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. In Q4, digital revenue grew over 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 45% of total revenue. As Brian mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, we have begun providing trailing 12-month bookings, which can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. We took the opportunity to enhance our bookings definition, modifying it to exclude overlap from early renewals and to include bookings from unintegrated acquired entities. As of Q4 2021, trailing 12-month bookings based on our revised definition, were $23.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2. Moving on to segment results for the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 19%, which includes a positive 900 basis points of Samlink impact. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in our North American banking business, where revenue grew high single-digits and internationally within insurance. Across banking and insurance, we are continuing to invest into our talent and digital capabilities, while focusing on broadening our client base and driving improved profitable growth. In 2022, we expect our recovery to continue. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by double-digit organic growth in life sciences. Our healthcare payer and provider business grew in the mid single-digits, driven by our integrated software solutions. As we discussed during our investor briefing in November, we see a large and growing market opportunity in the healthcare space and our capabilities across healthcare payer, provider and life sciences provide us a unique industry perspective and client intimacy that we believe provides ample opportunity to support sustainable growth in the years ahead. Products and resources revenue momentum continued, with revenue increasing 18%, the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Revenue was again driven by strong performance in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, which grew double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue in 2021. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year, with quarterly revenue now back above pre-pandemic levels. Revenue growth also included 550 basis points from our recent acquisitions. Communications, media and technology revenue grew 13%, of which approximately 300 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was again led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, North American revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by banking, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 33% year-over-year in constant currency, including 13 points of Samlink impact. Growth was led by the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within financial services, products and resources, and communications, media and technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our acquisitions of Servian and ESG Mobility, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.3% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 300 basis points, driven primarily by the Samlink charge in the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, merit increases for the majority of employees were effective October 1, which negatively impacted margin in the quarter. Supply chain constraints and our elevated attrition has kept subcontractor, recruiting and other delivery costs elevated, while our recently completed acquisitions have also negatively impacted our margin. While we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth, we have also moderated non-strategic spend, which has helped partially offset the labor cost pressure. Our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22%, below the low end of full year guidance range, benefiting from discrete items which we do not expect to repeat in the future. Q4 diluted GAAP and adjusted EPS were both $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q4 was $760 million, representing approximately 130% of net income. This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $2.2 billion and represented a cash flow conversion of over 100% of net income, which was in line with our prior guidance. DSO of 69 days declined by 3 days sequentially and by 1 day year-over-year. DSO will remain a key lever to support strong free cash flow conversion over the medium-term. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for $66 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend and spent cash of $255 million on acquisitions. In 2021, we\u2019ve returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and spent approximately $1 billion on acquisitions. This was consistent with our capital deployment framework introduced in Q4 2020 and reiterated at our November investor briefing. In support of our capital deployment framework, today, we have also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, our third consecutive annual increase and fourth since we initiated the dividend in 2017. We also expect to return at least $500 million through share repurchases in 2022, subject to market conditions and other factors. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.84 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 9% to 10% or 10.2% to 11.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 120 basis point impact and an inorganic contribution of approximately 200 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be towards the high end of our medium-term financial framework, which is consistent with our expectations at the November 2021 investor briefing. We expect full year revenue of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, representing 7.8% to 8 point \u2013 I apologize, representing 7.8% to 10.8% growth or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a negative 70 basis points impact and includes 200 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. This inorganic assumption includes approximately 100 basis points from future acquisitions. Full year guidance also includes the negative impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary, which was completed on February 1. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Consistent with our outlook at the November 2021 investor briefing, we expect 2022 to be towards the lower end of our medium-term financial framework. For 2022, our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 15.6% to 15.7% assumes approximately 25 basis points of expansion at the midpoint from 2021. While we are not providing quarterly margin guidance, we expect typical seasonality in 2022, which includes stronger margin performance in Q2 and Q3 while Q1 and Q4 are expected to be below our full year guidance. In Q1, we expect some modest sequential pressure driven by compensation costs and seasonal factors. Our outlook for margin assumes the industry supply side constraints continue and that attrition remains elevated in 2022. In response, we will continue to invest into our talent, including through merit increases, promotions, career development opportunities and training. This will include hiring of approximately 50,000 recent college graduates, targeted lateral hires and the continued use of subcontractors. Similar to 2021, we will continue to moderate non-strategic SG&A spend to help offset some of this pressure in the near term. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.46 to $4.60. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million. Our outlook also assumes average share outstanding of approximately 522 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year.  With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. Maybe we start with Brian. No question, you seem well exposed to demand in this environment. But on the supply side, as we sit here, I guess, over a month into the first quarter, could you share a few thoughts on attrition and level of confidence you have that we may be on the right side of the peak in attrition trends at this point? And maybe share what initiatives seem to be resonating the most with employees?\nBrian Humphries: Hi, Brian. Yes, what I\u2019d add there is \u2013 we are in a robust demand environment. That\u2019s not a concern for me. I am expecting that to continue in the coming year and there is lots of mix trends that will support that statement undoubtedly, but we are circling in, my perspective an unprecedented competition for talent. We\u2019ve seen a slight moderation sequentially on an annualized basis. January has been in line with that. But to be very honest, it\u2019s too early to call this a trend for the year. There is natural seasonality one expects to see in the course of the year coming up to bonus periods, etcetera. So as Jan pointed out, we\u2019re expecting elevated attrition through the course of the year. And obviously, we\u2019re going to work very hard to try to mitigate that and try and minimize the impact on the business, the implications of attrition in our quarter across financial, commercial implications as well as employee implications. And the levers we\u2019re using against that is naturally to try and recruit as many people as we can. I\u2019m delighted we\u2019ve been able to recruit 40 \u2013 to add a net 41,000 headcount year-over-year, and compliments to our team because I think it is a core competency of Cognizant in this regard. But what we\u2019re doing in terms of employees, as Jan pointed out, as I did too in my script, a lot of efforts around hearts and minds. There is a lot of effort around compensation measures, which of course, is pretty critical. I think it\u2019s essential for us to continue to show up and post strong double-digit growth, which is helping get a degree of confidence and swagger and optimism back into the company and just continue to support our employees by celebrating success and giving them career path potential, which, of course, growth does. And on top of that, we\u2019ve revised the way we think about promotion cycles and other such things in the course of the year. So it\u2019s been a very hands-on engagement for me down through the entire leadership team. In the last 6, 9 months, we spotted this early. We\u2019ve added more recruiters, and we\u2019ve really put a lot of efforts in place to run a retention task force. But be that as it may, as you\u2019ve seen with many of our peers, attrition is elevated and we assume will stay elevated through the course of the year.\nBrian Essex: Great. That\u2019s super helpful, thank you for that. And maybe to follow-up with Jan, could you maybe frame out the scenarios where you might see upside to margins for the year? And is there any rule of thumb for appreciation of the dollar versus the rupee and how that might impact margins going forward as we track FX?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. The \u2013 I don\u2019t want to up my guidance in my first question for the call, as you might imagine, so we have our work cut out to achieve the margin guidance that we give. We feel confident about it. But as you know, we talked about compensation measures, but other factors that are impacting our portfolio in a negative as they are positive factors. So I want to point out some of the drivers that obviously are helping us, the accelerated revenue itself is a help on margin so that helps. Our digital business continues to be slightly more profitable than our traditional business. So accelerated digital is built into our \u2013 solid digital growth is built into our plan. And we continue to make progress on our cost of delivery structure with bringing in college graduates, which will improve the overall cost structure over time. So we rely on a number of offsetting factors in order to achieve our guidance. And obviously, any over or underperformance could yield positive or negative outcomes. So I say balanced, we feel good about our 20 to 30-point outlook.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks, guys. Good stuff here. I had a follow-up question on attrition, but this time more related to the senior levels of Cognizant. Can you give a sense for how your attrition levels are running in the top few levels of the organization and what steps you\u2019ve been taking to retain some of the key leaders that have been driving the transformation? Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Hi, Lisa, it\u2019s Brian. So let me address that. To be very honest, I\u2019m not at all concerned about that. The majority of our attrition is at the junior levels and certain skills. And I would say at the senior levels of the organization at this moment in time, we\u2019re very much with our return business as usual. Promotions, some refreshing of talent, if deemed necessarily, based on financial results and other leadership attributes, what is essentially normal in a company of our size, some retirements, etcetera. So sometimes we intervene based on performance but this is more classic business as usual operations at this stage. We feel very good about the motivation of the team collectively. We\u2019re all in this together is certainly teams forward as we say internally, and I feel that that we\u2019re all on the same page. The leaders I brought in have certainly refreshed their teams, strengthened their teams. I will tell you right now, I feel I have better instrumentation in terms of how to run the company than at any time since I\u2019ve been here in terms of the analytical rigor that Jan and his team has put in place. The HR team have done some tremendous work in terms of where we stand there, etcetera. So we just feel or I certainly feel a lot more comfortable that we\u2019re on top of our game and we know how things are going, so not a concern.\nLisa Ellis: Okay, good. And then a follow-up for you as well, Brian, just on the demand environment, can you just talk a little bit as you\u2019re engaging with clients going into 2022, what do you anticipate or you feel is sort of different about the demand environment looking forward as your clients are emerging from the pandemic and maybe trying to get a little bit back to business as usual?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, I mean, I think to be very honest, clients are well passed, by now, the initial send hesitancy of COVID for a CEO or for anybody in a sales organization, certainly the enemy is indecision and we don\u2019t have indecision, far from it these days. People have really moved well beyond where we were approximately 2 years ago at this stage. And people are extremely focused, of course, on driving digital transformation agendas, evolving their business models, which is good for us because our portfolio is stronger than it\u2019s ever been before, and it allows us to work on a high-impact work for clients as are really driving some of the big innovation journeys that they have. Now of course, that leads to discussions around AI and analytics, consumer-centric, if you will, user experiences built on enterprise class applications, obviously, cybersecurity, digital engineering, cloud migrations. And throughout the world, as I deal with clients, it\u2019s always surprising to see how different clients are in terms of where they are on client migrations. I think the one thing that continues to go from strength to strength is, of course, the growing scale, hyperscaler cloud providers. They are, from my perspective, certainly shortening innovation cycles, throwing a lot of commercial muscle and financial muscle to accommodate or ensure accelerated cloud migrations. And of course, in more recent times, they really evolved towards industry clouds, not just the hyperscalers, but also the major SaaS vendors, which allow more integrated vertical workflows, and Cognizant strength, therefore, in areas like Healthcare and Financial Services is of interest to them. But it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen before, Lisa, to be very honest, a huge push towards classic modernization initiatives towards data, analytics, cloud, digital engineering. And really, what I find, clients are certainly willing to spend for skills and innovation but certainly expect more efficiencies and a more traditional non-digital work. And we see that in our pricing dynamics, and I certainly see that in terms of client strategic intentions in the years ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nDarrin Peller: Thanks, guys. When looking at your outlook, your confidence level around your revenue growth, but obviously, coupled with margins in the right direction, a little more than we had initially modeled for the year ahead. I mean, it really does give us more conviction that the pricing power you have is able to offset wage inflation. So I\u2019d love to hear more color on that, if you don\u2019t mind, in terms of the environment you\u2019re in and whether or not you\u2019re able to really pass through whatever you need to on the price point side. And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, is there \u2013 are there other \u2013 have there been any like advances in decoupling the linearity on the business model at all in a greater way over the past quarter into this next couple of quarters?\nBrian Humphries: I\u2019ll start, Jan. By all means, jump in at any stage. So Darrin, first of all, pricing remains somewhat stable. And as I\u2019ve just mentioned to Lisa, based on her question, we see differences between the digital work and the non-digital side. Clients will pay up for skills and innovation and, frankly, availability for resources in digital. Of course, that happens to be in an industry where people tend to have MSAs and rate cards that have been agreed in advance. So it requires us to interrupt those rate cards, but certain clients see, in their own workforce as well as other vendors, a desire for companies like Cognizant to ultimately drive some pricing power, given the labor trends that we see. But of course, price increases can and have lagged talent-related cost increases. We put a lot of effort around pricing, both rate card, intelligence, big deal, pricing, and it is certainly one of the factors that\u2019s inherent in our guidance for the coming year. And as I\u2019ve said earlier as well, the fact that we have scaled our digital portfolio to approximately 45% of the business pits us into more strategic client projects, pits us against different competitors and then arguably provides us with a pricing opportunity as long as we get the gross margin right on digital skills versus the classic non-digital skills. The last thing I\u2019ll say just around pricing, of course, because it\u2019s inherent in your question, it\u2019s a margin question, and our margins can also naturally be helped by the type of work we sell solution and deliver. So we continue to focus on evolving the company towards selling and delivering client outcomes. That allows us to own more of our pyramid, to industrialize delivery, to better leverage automation and optimize our mix as well as our pyramid. Specific to your other question around decoupling of, I guess, the Holy Grail in a services company, to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth. Look, there are many factors at play there as well, including the shift to more offshore delivery. In the course of the last year, our offshore delivery has increased for us about 2 points year-over-year, about 1 point sequentially, and that can help margin, but of course, it can hurt you in terms of headcount growth versus revenue growth or the so-called average rate per employee, and it can also change dollar margins as well as dollar revenue per employee. So there are multiple things at play here. We are a services company. We\u2019re committed to being a services company. We will certainly try to optimize and industrialize delivery where we can, leveraging automation, templatization, AI, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we are in the headcount business. And as we scale our headcount, we will scale our revenue and you guys are more than familiar with that model.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Maybe, Brian, you covered it, I think, on the pricing thing, but a little bit of color on the margin expansion because we really have taken a balanced view about the sources of the margin expansion here. And pricing is a factor but it\u2019s not the dominating factor. We have other elements like the natural shift of the business towards higher margin business. We have a scaling of \u2013 you saw this in the fourth quarter. We slowed the growth of SG&A in a meaningful way, and it\u2019s now contributing to margin actually at a slower than revenue growth rate. We expect that to contribute next year as well. And we have \u2013 we hope to see impact from our initiative to refresh our delivery permit, and Brian talked about the success that we had of bringing college graduates on. He mentioned this that we\u2019re planning to onboard 50,000 college graduates this year and that will help to streamline our cost of delivery permit and is also \u2013 so there is a variety of factors that drive it. And so pricing is a factor but only one among many.\nDarrin Peller: Okay, alright. I mean, I have other questions, but just in interest of time, I\u2019ll let you guys turn back in the queue and thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. You may proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you. I had two, if I could. Brian, if you could talk a little bit about healthcare and the potential for growth during \u201822 and beyond. You mentioned TriZetto was 13%. But just what are some of the factors that would lead to healthcare continuing, if not, getting improving its growth rate to contributing presumably to Cognizant being able to break on a consolidated basis, the 10% kind of organic growth? And I think healthcare would be one of the key drivers. If you could just talk about a little bit about that and then I have a margin question ask after?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, it\u2019s certainly our ambition to accelerate healthcare growth. In the November Analyst Meeting, we talked about market growth. But of course, within our healthcare business, we have the U.S. healthcare vertical, which is payer provider, the payer being the vast majority and then a product business, of course, coupled within that and then the less than 50% of our healthcare business is our life sciences business, which continues to grow double digits. I feel really great about that, both the nature of our capabilities, the nature of our client intimacy, the global nature of those clients and our bookings momentum in life sciences through the course of the year has been, frankly, outstanding and was very strong in Q4 as well. So candidly, as we are getting after the life sciences opportunity, it\u2019s all about continuing to scale biopharma. And then in this year, we have accelerated a little bit on medical device momentum there as well. We have also seen do some targeted acquisitions in the life sciences vertical in the last few years, including Zenith as well as TQS more recently. In the U.S. healthcare business, a lot of it is about getting the TriZetto business back on track. I think I mentioned in the November briefing, our growth rate in 2020 was twice that of 2019. And we have approximately doubled growth rate again in 2021 over 2020. And that\u2019s good in terms of client intimacy and relevance, in terms of margins and the pull-through opportunity or the stickiness of Cognizant in those accounts. So, getting payer and provider back into a higher growth trajectory, but making sure that the product-driven side of that scales as well is pretty essential to us. And then I have got to be honest, I am very motivated about where we are with TriZetto. I think it\u2019s a fantastic gem within the company. Now that we got growth back, we continue to explore possibilities in terms of where we can scale a healthcare franchise, both in terms of the market within the U.S., in terms of different applications within the ecosystem or different control points as well as exploring how we can scale our healthcare business into Canada and indeed into select international markets. I think if we do all of that right, we will drive market growth, if not more than market growth, and that\u2019s what the team is focused on.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Perfect. Now Jan, for you. Thank you, Brian. On the free cash flow margins, I think you said for \u201822, you want to do kind of 1x net income. If I just do some back-of-the-envelope, that would suggest that the free cash flow margin, which is free cash flow divided by the revenue, will be down again this year, I think perhaps not meaningfully. But are there other forces at work you think, in free cash flow in \u201822 that we should be aware of that might either positively or negatively impact whether working capital, taxes, CapEx, anything else you want to call out for our free cash flow models?\nJan Siegmund: The \u2013 no, I can give you a little bit the background of our thinking around the free cash flow conversion, which I think I mentioned in my script to be around 100%. We did a little bit better this year, had a very good quarter in free. I think with all these, now let\u2019s say it\u2019s basically maybe a slight increase in capital expenditures in the next year that we could see that is related to some more strategic investments internally. But nothing major. We continue to be laser focused on our sources of cash from our clients. So, we made good progress on DSO this year and that focus will remain. And to be quite honest, I am drawing a blank on cash. I think cash is going to be \u2013 on taxes. I think tax is going to be fairly similar to this year, so no major variation on the tax side. So, that\u2019s kind of how I expect the cash flow situation to evolve for us. So, nothing specific comes to mind, maybe a slight increase on capital expenditures that could drive it.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Alright. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi. Great. Thanks. Hope you can hear me guys? I think I wanted to ask on financial services, safe to say that some of the money center bank headwinds that we have been seeing \u2013 you have been seeing are far behind the company. I know there is a lot of pressure to spend in general amongst the banking side. But just curious how you are feeling there, both from a competitive standpoint and from a cyclical standpoint?\nBrian Humphries: Look, from my perspective, we have been working on recovering in financial services for quite a time. There has been a pace of recovery candidly through the course of the year, but the 10% constant currency growth, if I exclude the 9 points benefit we got from the year-over-year compare from the accounting charge in Q4 last year\u2019s results is probably the highest level of constant currency growth we have had in quite a few years. And this has ultimately been on the back of a series of things we have been doing, sharpening our focus on our top clients, refreshing some of the commercial team as well as, by the way, some of the leadership team, both in delivery as well as in the business. And back to a question I had earlier, that\u2019s part and parcel of running a world-class company. Sometimes, you have to refresh leaders if you are not getting the results you want. We have added a lot of talent with a focus on executive engagement at a client-facing level while the collaboration with the hyperscalers committed to their industry cloud or financial cloud and of course, a partner ecosystem. And all of that has now started to bear fruit. I am cautiously optimistic around our growing competitiveness there. We are leading more with digital. We are leading more with what I would call less interviews or staff augmentation type work. We are getting better margins for that. And I think our competitiveness will continue to increase in the course of the year. Of course, with the decision that we took last year, which was closed ultimately yesterday, I believe around the Samlink sale, we have a compare sequentially and year-over-year in the first quarter and beyond, which we will have an anomaly that we can talk to in subsequent calls. But generally, I feel that the team have done great work. We expect continued improvements in 2022, will be a paced recovery. I am not suggesting we are back to our full strength yet. But we are working both well across the regional banks, but I am also optimistic around the progress that the refreshed leadership team are making with some of the larger global banks. And if we are able to crack some of those, of course, that will show up in the numbers as well. So generally, I feel as though we are on the right track and team have worked hard and deserve growing momentum in the business.\nTien-tsin Huang: Understood. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nRayna Kumar: Good evening Brian and Jan. Thanks for taking my question. So, you have now had two consecutive quarters of 20%-plus bookings growth. Could you talk about the sustainability of that as well as book-to-bill above one?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. We had that 22% bookings growth, mid-teens for the full year, and it\u2019s driven, obviously, by the strong demand that we see in the market. It\u2019s supported by the investments that we made into our market organization with incremental sales capabilities and solution capabilities. And it\u2019s aided by a broadening solution set that we are developing ourselves as well as our M&A that is contributing to this. So, we are optimistic about maintaining a book-to-bill ratio that is similar to where we are as we saw our mindset, and we have seen really a very consistent execution, very consistent pipeline development. And the bookings momentum itself has been broad-based, has been good geographically split, and it has been, in general, of course, there are ups and downs by smaller business units, but it has been, when you lean back, fairly broad-based, which is all good news basically to assume that we are going to continue on that path.\nRayna Kumar: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. Nice results here. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on bookings to start, anything you can tell us about the mix of new work versus renewals in that $23 billion of trailing 12-month bookings?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. We don\u2019t really disclose details of the bookings number. It is a mix but the mix has been stable, and it is really not contributing one way or the other to the overall composition of the bookings number stayed basically stable, but we are not disclosing components of it.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Just as a follow-up, I know you are including 100 basis points of inorganic revenue contribution in the 2022 guide for deals that you haven\u2019t yet announced. Can you just talk about the line of sight to executing on enough deals to drive that, I guess $185 million or so of revenue that you would need?\nBrian Humphries: Yes, we have a very capable development team and M&A team, of course, proven over the last 2 years to execute a steady stream of these strategic acquisitions, small and medium size in nature. And we continue to see great opportunities for us to align our strategic goals with that. So, we are bringing already, approximately, as you can see from our guidance in the first quarter, we are bringing already some momentum with the acquisition of Devbridge into the momentum. So yes, we feel confident about the 100 basis points to be executing within this year.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Looking at Slide 13, onsite employee utilization fell to the lowest level in 3 years, which is really the history of this chart, and it looks like offshore employee utilization fell to about a six quarter low. Can you just talk through the utilization dynamics? Clearly, they are tied to the attrition numbers. And what are your expectations for both offshore and on-site utilization in your 2022 guidance? Thank you.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. You are right in the observation. There is some impact in the chart by our switch to a nine-hour bill week that has lowered our utilization, so that is in the last few quarters in there. But the overall dynamic is largely driven by the acceleration of on-boarding new associates that have some utilization lack in the beginning of their tenure. So, that was really the biggest driver of a downtick in utilization that we are seeing basically. And so we are kind of happy to have a little bit bigger bench to fulfill client needs. So for us, utilization levels are really at the desired level of where we want to see it.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Just as a quick follow-up, Brian, could you expand upon your comment that you are seeing more clients ask for price efficiency in the legacy work? What \u2013 how much price efficiency, if you will, are they looking for? And are you able to offset that through lower costs?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, we have obviously embraced automation. We have taken out double-digit thousands of people from our fixed price contracts in the last few years, so we continue to automate our agenda. I will say, the other thing you have seen is our digital mix hasn\u2019t scaled as much as we assumed previously because we have been quite successful in the non-digital part of our portfolio, arguably more successful than others scaling that and mitigating the downside. So, it\u2019s a street combat every single time you are coming up for renewal. You want to be clever as well in some of the classic areas to make sure you try and up-sell to modernization or beyond and try to get a renewal plus an expansion. But I feel as though we have handled ourselves well in that regard and we have a lot of effort underway, as I said earlier, to try to continue to evolve the company to an area where we are better able to industrialize delivery, which will help ultimately our margins and indeed, the quality of our delivery. So, I feel pretty good about where we are in that regard. Our biggest focus naturally is to scale digital, while we protect the non-digital business and mitigate the downside. And for the guidance we gave in November, we assume that will grow low to mid-single digits. Our real focus as a company, and that\u2019s core to our strategy, is our momentum in digital, which is growing 20% plus or minus.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nBrian Humphries: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Within the 2022 growth outlook, can you talk about some of your expectations across the industry segments this year? And anything to be mindful about around the cadence of growth as you built the plan?\nJan Siegmund: Can you repeat that? You broke up in the beginning of your question.\nBryan Bergin: Yes, sure. So, the expectations across the industry segments for growth this year within the context of the consolidated plan. And then just anything around cadence we should be aware of.\nJan Siegmund: On the cadence of the growth, I think we have a typical revenue number we gave you, basically our outlook for the first quarter. It\u2019s nothing really that I have to specify more, I think, on the revenue quarterly cadence. Relative to the industry growth, I would just point out that we had a one-time impact from Samlink in the financial services sector. But we \u2013 despite that grow over one-time impact, we expect continued moderate growth in the financial services group, and all other groups should continue with the momentum. So, I think it\u2019s a fairest thing if you just build a momentum case for our four big industry groups to get a good forecast.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just the international opportunity, I know this has been a big focus for you, but investments to drive more traction there. Can you talk about your expectations for growth in markets outside of the U.S. in 2022? Which ones you are most excited about and some of the initiatives that you continue to drive?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. So look, this is something I am particularly passionate about. Cognizant\u2019s brand internationally certainly wasn\u2019t known as much as in key industries in North America and naturally in our offshore areas, so we put a coordinated effort in place to reposition the brand. We have refreshed a lot of our country leaders across Europe and the Middle East. And I think we are seeing the fruits of that labor right now. You saw a 28% growth in the UK this quarter. Our UK momentum has been building through the course of the year. It\u2019s nicely profitable for us as well in terms of relative profitability vis-\u00e0-vis other European countries. And we also have a lot of momentum in areas like Australia and New Zealand. So, the seniority and the capability of the team we have built allows us to have confidence to deploy M&A to support their growth ambitions as well. That\u2019s what we did in Australia and that\u2019s what we are doing in Germany. You have seen the ESG acquisition we did in the last year. So generally, I feel very optimistic about our potential there. It is a year where we had strong bookings. We have to just continue to build on that in the years ahead, but I am \u2013 ultimately, if we are here 3 years, 4 years from now, looking back, I would like to think this will have been a really big success story for us. Now it\u2019s not only about capturing the revenue opportunity, that revenue opportunity which will be fueled more with digital type work more than historical levels also requires more local and a global delivery network. And that\u2019s also an area where I am pleased to see the momentum we have had. We announced most recently the build-out in Canada and Nova Scotia. But in the last few months, we announced thousands of extra roles across Adelaide and Australia as well as the UK, in Northern England and Northern Ireland. So, we are doing what is needed in terms of partnership, talent, delivery capabilities to get after the market opportunity internationally. And the fruits is very visible in our second largest country in the UK, which grew 28% this quarter.\nBryan Bergin: It sounds very good. Thank you.\nTyler Scott: Hi Laura, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. And I appreciate all the detail and color that you have provided. Back on the hiring side, how should we think about what you are feeling as the appropriate level of pace of hiring in the current environment? And I guess as part of that, I am looking for kind of number of net headcount additions, etcetera, going forward. And I guess maybe more importantly, how are you feeling about your capacity or infrastructure that you have in place to be able to address that or is that an area of potential investment?\nBrian Humphries: We have been investing behind our recruitment engine in the course of the last six months, nine months as we have spotted attrition to be a likely industry problem, we got out in front of perhaps others and we moved fast. And you have seen a net headcount expansion of 41,000 year-over-year since Q4 prior year period and another 12,000 sequentially. Of course, within a given year, subject to when we bring in our college graduates and onboard them, you will see different peaks country-by-country. But I am more than confident that we have an engine that is a core competency. The team has done an outstanding job for us. We have processes, tools, capabilities in place. Our brand standing is stronger increasingly not just in India, but overseas and some of the brand work we have done, both externally as well as our internal branding has given us more and more confidence that we have brand ambassadors in the company to make that happen. So, we are absolutely in the mode of accelerating headcount as best we can. The lower we can keep attrition, of course, is the most productive way to do that. And in the meantime, as Jan pointed out, we have done the heavy lifting. We have made significant progress around the delivery pyramid, this year, 33,000, up from 17,000 in the prior year period and next year, we are assuming 50,000. And if needed, we will try and scale beyond that. So for me, it\u2019s about retention and it\u2019s about recruitment and getting the balance right between those. But I am certainly bullish on the industry, bullish on our position within the industry, and I would like to have more headcount in Cognizant. So, if you know people, send them our way.\nJan Siegmund: Regarding capacity, as you know, we are still operating in a largely virtual environment and depending on the development of the pandemic, we will make obviously, decisions in the future. But I think the working model I said we are going to settle in a hybrid model. So, relative to capacity in the sense of bricks-and-mortar, I think we feel very well equipped to handle the growth and that shouldn\u2019t be anything unusual. The reigniting of the non-virtual component will bring some cost pressures in it, but that is reflected in our margin guidance.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great. Thanks Brian. Thanks Jan.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thanks, James, and thank you, everyone for joining. We appreciate your interest in Cognizant and look forward to catching up next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solutions Q4 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Throughout 2021, clients have meaningfully accelerated spend on digital transformation initiatives, accelerating the demand for IT services. Elevated attrition in key digital skills is however a direct consequence of this, creating revenue fulfillment challenges and cost pressure that need to be carefully navigated. I am therefore pleased that we had another quarter of solid execution, delivering against our commitments to clients and to you, our shareholders. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, above the high end of our guidance. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 15.3% and full year adjusted operating margin was 15.4% in line with our guidance. During the quarter, we also progressed against our key strategic initiatives, including scaling our digital capabilities, globalizing the company, helping our clients be successful by leading with greater industry insights and solutions and repositioning the Cognizant brand. Turning now to industry segments, our recovery in Financial Services continued with fourth quarter growth of 19% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an approximate 9 percentage point benefit from the impact of the prior year charge related to Samlink. As you know, we have been rebuilding our strength in Financial Services by refreshing our leadership in client-facing teams, strengthening our partner engagement, shifting our portfolio of services to more attractive market segments, and sharpening our focus on priority industry solutions and clients. We expect to build further on this progress in 2022. As we reposition Cognizant as a digital transformation provider in larger banking clients, we have complemented this with sustained momentum in regional banks. KeyBank, where we have just renewed our engagement as their primary digital partner, is a great example of this. We will further enable their digital transformation by digitizing their products to increase their digitally active customers to approximately 85%, by driving remote self-service growth by more than 40%, by automating front-to-back processes, and by migrating more than half of their application portfolio to the cloud. In insurance, we see continued demand for core modernization and digital transformation, including cloud and analytics. Unum, a global leader in disability insurance and group benefits, is partnering with us to pursue their digital transformation focus on agent and customer experiences and associated analytics. These digital solutions enhance our existing application development and maintenance services relationship with Unum. And for a long-time client, Royal London, the UK's largest mutual life, pensions and investment firm, we are now extending our partnership to reimagine their customer engagement through personalized seamless connected customer journeys enabled by cloud, data and customer-centric principles. In healthcare, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. We have substantially increased our competitiveness in healthcare by investing in digital solutions, domain expertise and partnerships, and by modernizing our core platforms. We have seen continuing momentum in our TriZetto product business, which grew 13% in 2021. We continue to add new footprints and in 2021, increased the number of overall members supported by our platforms to approximately 210 million. We see solid commercial momentum across our healthcare payer and provider business. For instance, Humana, a large national payer is modernizing and moving their legacy ecosystem to the cloud and has chosen Cognizant as a partner for agency, marketing and clinical transformation. These initiatives will help improve Humana's customer and employee satisfaction, reduce cost, and enhance the delivery of integrated personalized experiences to their members. We also have momentum with next-generation healthcare companies like Reliq Health Technologies, a rapidly growing global telemedicine firm, which turned to us to expand their care management capabilities. Reliq will leverage Cognizant care management services to support the deployment of their care platform across managed care organizations, hospital networks and health insurance providers. In life sciences, we partnered with AbbVie, a leading global biopharma company, to help advance their digital transformation in safety and risk management, which will improve patient care and outcomes. Through our digital health consulting services augmented by capabilities in human-centered design and digital product engineering, AbbVie can understand the needs of patients and care providers, design fit-for-purpose solutions that support the patient journey, and incorporate feedback for ongoing innovation. These improvements will help AbbVie better support patients and care providers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and products. Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Drawing on our extensive experience helping automakers streamlined their operational tasks, Volvo Cars chose us to help harmonize their finance and accounting and procurement processes and implement intelligent process automation to support their digital transformation. This is a great example of our growing momentum in digital business operations, which significantly outpaced the BPO industry in 2021 and is set to continue to gain share. Top line growth has been fueled by momentum in intelligent process automation and strength in our digital-native client portfolio. Our work at Grundfos, a global leader in water technology and the world's largest pump manufacturer, perfectly illustrates our growing digital credentials. Grundfos initially selected Cognizant to establish an IoT-based intelligent platform to gather real-time pump data from the sensors and perform analytics to prevent, predict and respond to issues caused by leakages. Based on this success, we have since been selected to build a modern enterprise system based on SAP S/4HANA. Finally, in communications, media and technology, we saw continued strength in technology, in particular, where we have sustained strong double-digit growth over the past three quarters. Turning now to bookings, which grew 22% year-over-year in the fourth quarter our second consecutive quarter of 20% plus growth. Full year 2021 bookings growth was in the mid-teens. We entered 2022 with a healthy book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Throughout the year, our bookings strength, which has been fueled by digital, has been broad-based across industries and geographies. Moving to the macro demand environment, industry demand remains robust and I expect it to continue throughout 2022. Clients are embracing digital operating models to become more efficient, agile, automated, scalable, innovative, and indeed, secure, whilst also responding to the expectations of their customers and employees for hyper personalized experiences. Continuing to scale our digital capabilities is at the heart of our company strategy. Digital represented 45% of our revenue mix in Q4. As we noted during our recent investor briefing, we believe digital can become 55% to 60% of revenue in the coming years. Reflecting our strength in digital credentials, during the fourth quarter, we were named an industry leader in 70 new industry analyst reports. They highlighted the company's client partnerships, scalability, digital capabilities and expertise as factors in recognizing our leadership. Accelerating digital is not only a driver of double-digit revenue growth and improved margins it also fosters greater client intimacy and higher levels of employee engagement as we partner on strategic transformation projects that leverage advanced skills. Moving on now to an industry phenomenon you are accustomed to hearing about, the unprecedented competition for talent, reflective of the industry-wide demand/supply imbalance in key digital skills. Fourth quarter voluntary attrition moderated a little to 31% on an annualized basis or 28% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO. We have been working aggressively to mitigate attrition levels, whilst intensifying our efforts and focus on employee training, promotion cycles, professional development and total rewards. During 2021, we also facilitated more than 14,000 job moves across 40 countries, continue to revitalize our campus recruitment program in India, establish new compensation measures and a revised promotion cycle to retain employees and invested heavily in upskilling. In fact, our associates completed 23 million hours of learning and consumed 130,000 courses in 2021. Given that we compete on our knowledge and skills, we are proud to have won 42 awards for excellence in learning and development from the Brandon Hall Group, often considered the leading independent HCM research analyst firm. We more than offset elevated attrition levels in 2021 by accelerating our hiring allowing us to increase company headcount by 14%. I am pleased to say that in recent years we have made meaningful progress in correcting our delivery pyramid by significantly increasing the number of college graduate hires onboarded in India. In 2021, we added a record 33,000 college graduate hires in India, up from 17,000 in 2020. In 2022, we plan to add approximately 50,000 in India. Digital acquisitions have also brought incredible talent to Cognizant. During 2021, we completed 7 acquisitions that extend our digital leadership, the most recent being our fourth quarter acquisition of Devbridge. This software consultancy and product development firm expands our software product engineering capabilities and global delivery footprint by adding more than 600 engineers, designers and product managers in Lithuania, Poland, the UK and North America. This extension of our global delivery network complements recent announcements in the United Kingdom, Australia, and indeed, Canada. In closing, I am proud of our execution against our strategy in 2021. We have reestablished commercial momentum and have a healthy book-to-bill ratio. Our delivery teams executed against our commitments despite challenging labor market conditions. Our performance in our two largest industries, Financial Services and Healthcare, has strengthened. Growth in key international markets such as the UK has meaningfully accelerated. Our digital portfolio has been extended and has never been stronger and we have made significant progress in our people strategy, our internal digitization agenda, and indeed, our brand repositioning. For several quarters now, I have been holding our long open-ended virtual sessions with small groups of employees. What I have learned from these intimate sessions as well as from our large virtual townhall meetings is that employee pride in the company is building. Employees see not only how far we have come, but also a clear path to an exciting future. Our employees also recognize the consistent execution of our strategy, our commercial momentum and a commitment to our purpose, vision and values. This purpose has kept us focused on executing our ESG agenda despite distress of a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Our ESG-focused commitment is evident in our Cognizant Combat COVID-19 initiative in India, in our intensified efforts to drive a culture of belonging throughout Cognizant, in our $250 million philanthropic initiative to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, along with health and well-being in communities around the world and in many other areas covered in our 2021 ESG report. In summary, our broad-based progress allows us to approach the new fiscal year with confidence in our ability to execute against the multiyear financial outlook we presented at our November investor briefing. So with that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Hi, Brian. Yes, what I'd add there is \u2013 we are in a robust demand environment. That's not a concern for me. I am expecting that to continue in the coming year and there is lots of mix trends that will support that statement undoubtedly, but we are circling in, my perspective an unprecedented competition for talent. We've seen a slight moderation sequentially on an annualized basis. January has been in line with that. But to be very honest, it's too early to call this a trend for the year. There is natural seasonality one expects to see in the course of the year coming up to bonus periods, etcetera. So as Jan pointed out, we're expecting elevated attrition through the course of the year. And obviously, we're going to work very hard to try to mitigate that and try and minimize the impact on the business, the implications of attrition in our quarter across financial, commercial implications as well as employee implications. And the levers we're using against that is naturally to try and recruit as many people as we can. I'm delighted we've been able to recruit 40 \u2013 to add a net 41,000 headcount year-over-year, and compliments to our team because I think it is a core competency of Cognizant in this regard. But what we're doing in terms of employees, as Jan pointed out, as I did too in my script, a lot of efforts around hearts and minds. There is a lot of effort around compensation measures, which of course, is pretty critical. I think it's essential for us to continue to show up and post strong double-digit growth, which is helping get a degree of confidence and swagger and optimism back into the company and just continue to support our employees by celebrating success and giving them career path potential, which, of course, growth does. And on top of that, we've revised the way we think about promotion cycles and other such things in the course of the year. So it's been a very hands-on engagement for me down through the entire leadership team. In the last 6, 9 months, we spotted this early. We've added more recruiters, and we've really put a lot of efforts in place to run a retention task force. But be that as it may, as you've seen with many of our peers, attrition is elevated and we assume will stay elevated through the course of the year. Hi, Lisa, it's Brian. So let me address that. To be very honest, I'm not at all concerned about that. The majority of our attrition is at the junior levels and certain skills. And I would say at the senior levels of the organization at this moment in time, we're very much with our return business as usual. Promotions, some refreshing of talent, if deemed necessarily, based on financial results and other leadership attributes, what is essentially normal in a company of our size, some retirements, etcetera. So sometimes we intervene based on performance but this is more classic business as usual operations at this stage. We feel very good about the motivation of the team collectively. We're all in this together is certainly teams forward as we say internally, and I feel that that we're all on the same page. The leaders I brought in have certainly refreshed their teams, strengthened their teams. I will tell you right now, I feel I have better instrumentation in terms of how to run the company than at any time since I've been here in terms of the analytical rigor that Jan and his team has put in place. The HR team have done some tremendous work in terms of where we stand there, etcetera. So we just feel or I certainly feel a lot more comfortable that we're on top of our game and we know how things are going, so not a concern. Yes. Look, I mean, I think to be very honest, clients are well passed, by now, the initial send hesitancy of COVID for a CEO or for anybody in a sales organization, certainly the enemy is indecision and we don't have indecision, far from it these days. People have really moved well beyond where we were approximately 2 years ago at this stage. And people are extremely focused, of course, on driving digital transformation agendas, evolving their business models, which is good for us because our portfolio is stronger than it's ever been before, and it allows us to work on a high-impact work for clients as are really driving some of the big innovation journeys that they have. Now of course, that leads to discussions around AI and analytics, consumer-centric, if you will, user experiences built on enterprise class applications, obviously, cybersecurity, digital engineering, cloud migrations. And throughout the world, as I deal with clients, it's always surprising to see how different clients are in terms of where they are on client migrations. I think the one thing that continues to go from strength to strength is, of course, the growing scale, hyperscaler cloud providers. They are, from my perspective, certainly shortening innovation cycles, throwing a lot of commercial muscle and financial muscle to accommodate or ensure accelerated cloud migrations. And of course, in more recent times, they really evolved towards industry clouds, not just the hyperscalers, but also the major SaaS vendors, which allow more integrated vertical workflows, and Cognizant strength, therefore, in areas like Healthcare and Financial Services is of interest to them. But it's very consistent with what we've seen before, Lisa, to be very honest, a huge push towards classic modernization initiatives towards data, analytics, cloud, digital engineering. And really, what I find, clients are certainly willing to spend for skills and innovation but certainly expect more efficiencies and a more traditional non-digital work. And we see that in our pricing dynamics, and I certainly see that in terms of client strategic intentions in the years ahead. I'll start, Jan. By all means, jump in at any stage. So Darrin, first of all, pricing remains somewhat stable. And as I've just mentioned to Lisa, based on her question, we see differences between the digital work and the non-digital side. Clients will pay up for skills and innovation and, frankly, availability for resources in digital. Of course, that happens to be in an industry where people tend to have MSAs and rate cards that have been agreed in advance. So it requires us to interrupt those rate cards, but certain clients see, in their own workforce as well as other vendors, a desire for companies like Cognizant to ultimately drive some pricing power, given the labor trends that we see. But of course, price increases can and have lagged talent-related cost increases. We put a lot of effort around pricing, both rate card, intelligence, big deal, pricing, and it is certainly one of the factors that's inherent in our guidance for the coming year. And as I've said earlier as well, the fact that we have scaled our digital portfolio to approximately 45% of the business pits us into more strategic client projects, pits us against different competitors and then arguably provides us with a pricing opportunity as long as we get the gross margin right on digital skills versus the classic non-digital skills. The last thing I'll say just around pricing, of course, because it's inherent in your question, it's a margin question, and our margins can also naturally be helped by the type of work we sell solution and deliver. So we continue to focus on evolving the company towards selling and delivering client outcomes. That allows us to own more of our pyramid, to industrialize delivery, to better leverage automation and optimize our mix as well as our pyramid. Specific to your other question around decoupling of, I guess, the Holy Grail in a services company, to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth. Look, there are many factors at play there as well, including the shift to more offshore delivery. In the course of the last year, our offshore delivery has increased for us about 2 points year-over-year, about 1 point sequentially, and that can help margin, but of course, it can hurt you in terms of headcount growth versus revenue growth or the so-called average rate per employee, and it can also change dollar margins as well as dollar revenue per employee. So there are multiple things at play here. We are a services company. We're committed to being a services company. We will certainly try to optimize and industrialize delivery where we can, leveraging automation, templatization, AI, et cetera. But at the end of the day, we are in the headcount business. And as we scale our headcount, we will scale our revenue and you guys are more than familiar with that model. Thank you. Yes. Look, it's certainly our ambition to accelerate healthcare growth. In the November Analyst Meeting, we talked about market growth. But of course, within our healthcare business, we have the U.S. healthcare vertical, which is payer provider, the payer being the vast majority and then a product business, of course, coupled within that and then the less than 50% of our healthcare business is our life sciences business, which continues to grow double digits. I feel really great about that, both the nature of our capabilities, the nature of our client intimacy, the global nature of those clients and our bookings momentum in life sciences through the course of the year has been, frankly, outstanding and was very strong in Q4 as well. So candidly, as we are getting after the life sciences opportunity, it's all about continuing to scale biopharma. And then in this year, we have accelerated a little bit on medical device momentum there as well. We have also seen do some targeted acquisitions in the life sciences vertical in the last few years, including Zenith as well as TQS more recently. In the U.S. healthcare business, a lot of it is about getting the TriZetto business back on track. I think I mentioned in the November briefing, our growth rate in 2020 was twice that of 2019. And we have approximately doubled growth rate again in 2021 over 2020. And that's good in terms of client intimacy and relevance, in terms of margins and the pull-through opportunity or the stickiness of Cognizant in those accounts. So, getting payer and provider back into a higher growth trajectory, but making sure that the product-driven side of that scales as well is pretty essential to us. And then I have got to be honest, I am very motivated about where we are with TriZetto. I think it's a fantastic gem within the company. Now that we got growth back, we continue to explore possibilities in terms of where we can scale a healthcare franchise, both in terms of the market within the U.S., in terms of different applications within the ecosystem or different control points as well as exploring how we can scale our healthcare business into Canada and indeed into select international markets. I think if we do all of that right, we will drive market growth, if not more than market growth, and that's what the team is focused on. Look, from my perspective, we have been working on recovering in financial services for quite a time. There has been a pace of recovery candidly through the course of the year, but the 10% constant currency growth, if I exclude the 9 points benefit we got from the year-over-year compare from the accounting charge in Q4 last year's results is probably the highest level of constant currency growth we have had in quite a few years. And this has ultimately been on the back of a series of things we have been doing, sharpening our focus on our top clients, refreshing some of the commercial team as well as, by the way, some of the leadership team, both in delivery as well as in the business. And back to a question I had earlier, that's part and parcel of running a world-class company. Sometimes, you have to refresh leaders if you are not getting the results you want. We have added a lot of talent with a focus on executive engagement at a client-facing level while the collaboration with the hyperscalers committed to their industry cloud or financial cloud and of course, a partner ecosystem. And all of that has now started to bear fruit. I am cautiously optimistic around our growing competitiveness there. We are leading more with digital. We are leading more with what I would call less interviews or staff augmentation type work. We are getting better margins for that. And I think our competitiveness will continue to increase in the course of the year. Of course, with the decision that we took last year, which was closed ultimately yesterday, I believe around the Samlink sale, we have a compare sequentially and year-over-year in the first quarter and beyond, which we will have an anomaly that we can talk to in subsequent calls. But generally, I feel that the team have done great work. We expect continued improvements in 2022, will be a paced recovery. I am not suggesting we are back to our full strength yet. But we are working both well across the regional banks, but I am also optimistic around the progress that the refreshed leadership team are making with some of the larger global banks. And if we are able to crack some of those, of course, that will show up in the numbers as well. So generally, I feel as though we are on the right track and team have worked hard and deserve growing momentum in the business. Yes, we have a very capable development team and M&A team, of course, proven over the last 2 years to execute a steady stream of these strategic acquisitions, small and medium size in nature. And we continue to see great opportunities for us to align our strategic goals with that. So, we are bringing already, approximately, as you can see from our guidance in the first quarter, we are bringing already some momentum with the acquisition of Devbridge into the momentum. So yes, we feel confident about the 100 basis points to be executing within this year. Yes. Look, we have obviously embraced automation. We have taken out double-digit thousands of people from our fixed price contracts in the last few years, so we continue to automate our agenda. I will say, the other thing you have seen is our digital mix hasn't scaled as much as we assumed previously because we have been quite successful in the non-digital part of our portfolio, arguably more successful than others scaling that and mitigating the downside. So, it's a street combat every single time you are coming up for renewal. You want to be clever as well in some of the classic areas to make sure you try and up-sell to modernization or beyond and try to get a renewal plus an expansion. But I feel as though we have handled ourselves well in that regard and we have a lot of effort underway, as I said earlier, to try to continue to evolve the company to an area where we are better able to industrialize delivery, which will help ultimately our margins and indeed, the quality of our delivery. So, I feel pretty good about where we are in that regard. Our biggest focus naturally is to scale digital, while we protect the non-digital business and mitigate the downside. And for the guidance we gave in November, we assume that will grow low to mid-single digits. Our real focus as a company, and that's core to our strategy, is our momentum in digital, which is growing 20% plus or minus. Yes. Yes. So look, this is something I am particularly passionate about. Cognizant's brand internationally certainly wasn't known as much as in key industries in North America and naturally in our offshore areas, so we put a coordinated effort in place to reposition the brand. We have refreshed a lot of our country leaders across Europe and the Middle East. And I think we are seeing the fruits of that labor right now. You saw a 28% growth in the UK this quarter. Our UK momentum has been building through the course of the year. It's nicely profitable for us as well in terms of relative profitability vis-a\u0300-vis other European countries. And we also have a lot of momentum in areas like Australia and New Zealand. So, the seniority and the capability of the team we have built allows us to have confidence to deploy M&A to support their growth ambitions as well. That's what we did in Australia and that's what we are doing in Germany. You have seen the ESG acquisition we did in the last year. So generally, I feel very optimistic about our potential there. It is a year where we had strong bookings. We have to just continue to build on that in the years ahead, but I am \u2013 ultimately, if we are here 3 years, 4 years from now, looking back, I would like to think this will have been a really big success story for us. Now it's not only about capturing the revenue opportunity, that revenue opportunity which will be fueled more with digital type work more than historical levels also requires more local and a global delivery network. And that's also an area where I am pleased to see the momentum we have had. We announced most recently the build-out in Canada and Nova Scotia. But in the last few months, we announced thousands of extra roles across Adelaide and Australia as well as the UK, in Northern England and Northern Ireland. So, we are doing what is needed in terms of partnership, talent, delivery capabilities to get after the market opportunity internationally. And the fruits is very visible in our second largest country in the UK, which grew 28% this quarter. We have been investing behind our recruitment engine in the course of the last six months, nine months as we have spotted attrition to be a likely industry problem, we got out in front of perhaps others and we moved fast. And you have seen a net headcount expansion of 41,000 year-over-year since Q4 prior year period and another 12,000 sequentially. Of course, within a given year, subject to when we bring in our college graduates and onboard them, you will see different peaks country-by-country. But I am more than confident that we have an engine that is a core competency. The team has done an outstanding job for us. We have processes, tools, capabilities in place. Our brand standing is stronger increasingly not just in India, but overseas and some of the brand work we have done, both externally as well as our internal branding has given us more and more confidence that we have brand ambassadors in the company to make that happen. So, we are absolutely in the mode of accelerating headcount as best we can. The lower we can keep attrition, of course, is the most productive way to do that. And in the meantime, as Jan pointed out, we have done the heavy lifting. We have made significant progress around the delivery pyramid, this year, 33,000, up from 17,000 in the prior year period and next year, we are assuming 50,000. And if needed, we will try and scale beyond that. So for me, it's about retention and it's about recruitment and getting the balance right between those. But I am certainly bullish on the industry, bullish on our position within the industry, and I would like to have more headcount in Cognizant. So, if you know people, send them our way."

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian and good afternoon everyone. We finished the year with solid momentum, driven by digital projects and entered 2022 with bookings momentum and strong customer demand. For the full year, revenue was $18.5 billion, representing an increase of 11% or 10% at constant currency. This includes 320 basis points contribution from our acquisitions. The charge in Q4 2020 related to the proposed exit from the customer engagement of our Samlink subsidiary contributed 70 basis points of growth. I will refer to this as the Samlink impact for the remainder of my remarks. For the full year, digital revenue grew over 19% and represented approximately 44% of total revenue. Q4 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 14% year-over-year or 14.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes 280 basis points of the Samlink impact and also 280 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. In Q4, digital revenue grew over 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 45% of total revenue. As Brian mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and for the full year. In Q4, we have begun providing trailing 12-month bookings, which can be found in the supplemental presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. We took the opportunity to enhance our bookings definition, modifying it to exclude overlap from early renewals and to include bookings from unintegrated acquired entities. As of Q4 2021, trailing 12-month bookings based on our revised definition, were $23.1 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2. Moving on to segment results for the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 19%, which includes a positive 900 basis points of Samlink impact. During the quarter, we saw positive trends in our North American banking business, where revenue grew high single-digits and internationally within insurance. Across banking and insurance, we are continuing to invest into our talent and digital capabilities, while focusing on broadening our client base and driving improved profitable growth. In 2022, we expect our recovery to continue. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by double-digit organic growth in life sciences. Our healthcare payer and provider business grew in the mid single-digits, driven by our integrated software solutions. As we discussed during our investor briefing in November, we see a large and growing market opportunity in the healthcare space and our capabilities across healthcare payer, provider and life sciences provide us a unique industry perspective and client intimacy that we believe provides ample opportunity to support sustainable growth in the years ahead. Products and resources revenue momentum continued, with revenue increasing 18%, the third consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. Revenue was again driven by strong performance in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, which grew double-digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue in 2021. Retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality also grew double digits year-over-year, with quarterly revenue now back above pre-pandemic levels. Revenue growth also included 550 basis points from our recent acquisitions. Communications, media and technology revenue grew 13%, of which approximately 300 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was again led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q4, North American revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by banking, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments. Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 33% year-over-year in constant currency, including 13 points of Samlink impact. Growth was led by the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within financial services, products and resources, and communications, media and technology segments. We also continued to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our acquisitions of Servian and ESG Mobility, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.3% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved by approximately 300 basis points, driven primarily by the Samlink charge in the prior year period. As we discussed last quarter, merit increases for the majority of employees were effective October 1, which negatively impacted margin in the quarter. Supply chain constraints and our elevated attrition has kept subcontractor, recruiting and other delivery costs elevated, while our recently completed acquisitions have also negatively impacted our margin. While we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth, we have also moderated non-strategic spend, which has helped partially offset the labor cost pressure. Our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22%, below the low end of full year guidance range, benefiting from discrete items which we do not expect to repeat in the future. Q4 diluted GAAP and adjusted EPS were both $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q4 was $760 million, representing approximately 130% of net income. This resulted in a full year free cash flow of $2.2 billion and represented a cash flow conversion of over 100% of net income, which was in line with our prior guidance. DSO of 69 days declined by 3 days sequentially and by 1 day year-over-year. DSO will remain a key lever to support strong free cash flow conversion over the medium-term. During the quarter, we repurchased 800,000 shares for $66 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend and spent cash of $255 million on acquisitions. In 2021, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and spent approximately $1 billion on acquisitions. This was consistent with our capital deployment framework introduced in Q4 2020 and reiterated at our November investor briefing. In support of our capital deployment framework, today, we have also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, our third consecutive annual increase and fourth since we initiated the dividend in 2017. We also expect to return at least $500 million through share repurchases in 2022, subject to market conditions and other factors. Turning to guidance. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.84 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 9% to 10% or 10.2% to 11.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 120 basis point impact and an inorganic contribution of approximately 200 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be towards the high end of our medium-term financial framework, which is consistent with our expectations at the November 2021 investor briefing. We expect full year revenue of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, representing 7.8% to 8 point \u2013 I apologize, representing 7.8% to 10.8% growth or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a negative 70 basis points impact and includes 200 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. This inorganic assumption includes approximately 100 basis points from future acquisitions. Full year guidance also includes the negative impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary, which was completed on February 1. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Consistent with our outlook at the November 2021 investor briefing, we expect 2022 to be towards the lower end of our medium-term financial framework. For 2022, our full year adjusted operating margin guidance of 15.6% to 15.7% assumes approximately 25 basis points of expansion at the midpoint from 2021. While we are not providing quarterly margin guidance, we expect typical seasonality in 2022, which includes stronger margin performance in Q2 and Q3 while Q1 and Q4 are expected to be below our full year guidance. In Q1, we expect some modest sequential pressure driven by compensation costs and seasonal factors. Our outlook for margin assumes the industry supply side constraints continue and that attrition remains elevated in 2022. In response, we will continue to invest into our talent, including through merit increases, promotions, career development opportunities and training. This will include hiring of approximately 50,000 recent college graduates, targeted lateral hires and the continued use of subcontractors. Similar to 2021, we will continue to moderate non-strategic SG&A spend to help offset some of this pressure in the near term. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.46 to $4.60. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million. Our outlook also assumes average share outstanding of approximately 522 million and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year.  With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. The \u2013 I don't want to up my guidance in my first question for the call, as you might imagine, so we have our work cut out to achieve the margin guidance that we give. We feel confident about it. But as you know, we talked about compensation measures, but other factors that are impacting our portfolio in a negative as they are positive factors. So I want to point out some of the drivers that obviously are helping us, the accelerated revenue itself is a help on margin so that helps. Our digital business continues to be slightly more profitable than our traditional business. So accelerated digital is built into our \u2013 solid digital growth is built into our plan. And we continue to make progress on our cost of delivery structure with bringing in college graduates, which will improve the overall cost structure over time. So we rely on a number of offsetting factors in order to achieve our guidance. And obviously, any over or underperformance could yield positive or negative outcomes. So I say balanced, we feel good about our 20 to 30-point outlook. Yes. Maybe, Brian, you covered it, I think, on the pricing thing, but a little bit of color on the margin expansion because we really have taken a balanced view about the sources of the margin expansion here. And pricing is a factor but it's not the dominating factor. We have other elements like the natural shift of the business towards higher margin business. We have a scaling of \u2013 you saw this in the fourth quarter. We slowed the growth of SG&A in a meaningful way, and it's now contributing to margin actually at a slower than revenue growth rate. We expect that to contribute next year as well. And we have \u2013 we hope to see impact from our initiative to refresh our delivery permit, and Brian talked about the success that we had of bringing college graduates on. He mentioned this that we're planning to onboard 50,000 college graduates this year and that will help to streamline our cost of delivery permit and is also \u2013 so there is a variety of factors that drive it. And so pricing is a factor but only one among many. The \u2013 no, I can give you a little bit the background of our thinking around the free cash flow conversion, which I think I mentioned in my script to be around 100%. We did a little bit better this year, had a very good quarter in free. I think with all these, now let's say it's basically maybe a slight increase in capital expenditures in the next year that we could see that is related to some more strategic investments internally. But nothing major. We continue to be laser focused on our sources of cash from our clients. So, we made good progress on DSO this year and that focus will remain. And to be quite honest, I am drawing a blank on cash. I think cash is going to be \u2013 on taxes. I think tax is going to be fairly similar to this year, so no major variation on the tax side. So, that's kind of how I expect the cash flow situation to evolve for us. So, nothing specific comes to mind, maybe a slight increase on capital expenditures that could drive it. Yes. We had that 22% bookings growth, mid-teens for the full year, and it's driven, obviously, by the strong demand that we see in the market. It's supported by the investments that we made into our market organization with incremental sales capabilities and solution capabilities. And it's aided by a broadening solution set that we are developing ourselves as well as our M&A that is contributing to this. So, we are optimistic about maintaining a book-to-bill ratio that is similar to where we are as we saw our mindset, and we have seen really a very consistent execution, very consistent pipeline development. And the bookings momentum itself has been broad-based, has been good geographically split, and it has been, in general, of course, there are ups and downs by smaller business units, but it has been, when you lean back, fairly broad-based, which is all good news basically to assume that we are going to continue on that path. Yes. We don't really disclose details of the bookings number. It is a mix but the mix has been stable, and it is really not contributing one way or the other to the overall composition of the bookings number stayed basically stable, but we are not disclosing components of it. Yes. You are right in the observation. There is some impact in the chart by our switch to a nine-hour bill week that has lowered our utilization, so that is in the last few quarters in there. But the overall dynamic is largely driven by the acceleration of on-boarding new associates that have some utilization lack in the beginning of their tenure. So, that was really the biggest driver of a downtick in utilization that we are seeing basically. And so we are kind of happy to have a little bit bigger bench to fulfill client needs. So for us, utilization levels are really at the desired level of where we want to see it. Can you repeat that? You broke up in the beginning of your question. On the cadence of the growth, I think we have a typical revenue number we gave you, basically our outlook for the first quarter. It's nothing really that I have to specify more, I think, on the revenue quarterly cadence. Relative to the industry growth, I would just point out that we had a one-time impact from Samlink in the financial services sector. But we \u2013 despite that grow over one-time impact, we expect continued moderate growth in the financial services group, and all other groups should continue with the momentum. So, I think it's a fairest thing if you just build a momentum case for our four big industry groups to get a good forecast. Regarding capacity, as you know, we are still operating in a largely virtual environment and depending on the development of the pandemic, we will make obviously, decisions in the future. But I think the working model I said we are going to settle in a hybrid model. So, relative to capacity in the sense of bricks-and-mortar, I think we feel very well equipped to handle the growth and that shouldn't be anything unusual. The reigniting of the non-virtual component will bring some cost pressures in it, but that is reflected in our margin guidance."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin your presentation.\nTyler Scott : Thank you, Operator. And good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the Company's Third Quarter of 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries : Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times revenue and a trailing 12-month basis underscores our commercial momentum. I'm grateful to our teams around the world for their resourcefulness in meeting our client commitments despite a challenging labor market. We delivered solid sequential adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter as we offset the cost of increased hiring with cost discipline elsewhere. I'm also pleased with our progress against our key strategic initiatives.  For example, third quarter digital revenue grew 18% year-over-year. Digital represents 44% of our overall revenue mix. We expect this percentage to grow in future periods, positioning Cognizant for both top-line momentum and margin expansion. Moreover, the intimacy of our C-suite engagement increases as we serve clients in their digital transformations. Better-than-expected growth in our non-digital business impacted our digital mix progression, but is nonetheless a welcome outcome. During the third quarter, we saw continued strong top-line momentum in our digital business operations practice, reflecting our differentiated offerings for digital natives, our BPaaS leadership position in healthcare, and our strength in intelligence process automation solutions.  We recently announced Cognizant Neuro, a simpler and more effective way for clients to achieve the full potential of intelligent process automation and speed time to results. Everest Group, a leading industry analyst firm, recently recognized Cognizant Neuro as an exciting development to enable automation at scale.  Moving to industry segments. Financial services ongoing recovery continued, with growth of 4.3% year-over-year in constant currency in line with our expectations. We posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year in constant currency in products and resources and in communications, media, and technology.  Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities, as well as across retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality, which have recovered to pre -pandemic levels. In communications, media, and technology, we continue to lead with our digital engineering capability to win transformation deals, while leveraging our alliances to be a premier cloud transformation partner.  In healthcare, we had another solid quarter, achieving 9.8% constant-currency growth. Momentum in life sciences continued, demand across payers remain strong, and we're beginning to see an uptick in demand across providers as they look to digital technologies to help reduce operating costs and strengthened new channels for delivering care. Our products business saw a continued double-digit growth in Q3.  We're expanding our footprint in the healthcare market and adding new growth members on our platforms. We're also well underway with our digital transformation of our products, including the launch of our connected interoperability solutions to help clients provide secure, real-time data access, and meet compliance deadlines.  We're proud of the work we're doing in partnership with clients like Parkland Community Health Plan. Parkland was looking for better ways to meet the growing needs of its medically underserved populations in Texas.  As a better managers health insurance claims, member transactions, and network of physicians and hospitals, our TriZetto QNXT Core Administration platform, delivered in a BPaaS model is enabling delivery of care management, claims processing, member services, provider services, and quality on a single platform, thereby enhancing care coordination and member experiences.  Our healthcare business is a hugely strategic asset. I'm pleased with the progress we've made accelerating growth in healthcare, and I'm optimistic in our future prospects as healthcare companies modernize their business to address the need for enhanced client experiences, including virtual care solutions. Let's turn now to Strategy, including our digital ambitions.  I remain bullish on both the macro demand environment and Cognizant's growing momentum in Digital. Clients continue to accelerate their investment in digital operating models to improve their customer and employee experiences, and modernize their operations through data automation and cloud.  While most companies have launched digital initiatives, few have made the shift to a fully-digital operating model. Cognizant is now one of the few global firms that can serve clients across all stages of their digital transformation, from modernizing their technology foundation to implementing agile workflows.  This is in part a result of investing approximately $3 billion in mergers and acquisitions over the past few years to broaden our portfolio, while strengthening our relationships with hyperscalers and key partners. Good client example is Cabot Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials, who recently engaged us to help transform their digital operating model.  We'll be providing application development and maintenance, as well as infrastructure and operation services. And enabling Cabot to create an enhanced digital experience that drives value for its customers and employees. Gaining our international operations is another strategic priority.  And during the Third Quarter, we grew bookings and revenue solidly in both Europe and rest of world, with the highlight being 19% constant-currency revenue growth in the United Kingdom. We remain optimistic on our international market prospects and aim to accelerate growth as we invest in our talents, brand, partnerships, and operations.  Global Biopharma leader Sanofi has selected Cognizant as a strategic partner to deploy an omnichannel customer engagement model; the solution will enable their customer-facing teams to engage with healthcare professionals for the new digital channels, provide them more personalized content, and also suggest next best actions.  Cognizant deployed the cloud-based CRN, integrated marketing automation and Intelligent Data Platform to the first 18 markets in just eight months. And for Her Majesties revenue and customs, the UK government's tax authority, we're providing broad technology expertise across its Pega technology SPAC, and enabling Pega application development and operational support that will facilitate case management and customer service applications.  Moving on now to the intensifying competition for talent across multiple industries. The demand-supply imbalance in our ore industry remains particularly acute. Third quarter voluntary attrition reached 33% on an annualized basis, or 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire Company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO.  Despite elevated attrition, we increased our net headcount in Q3 by over 17,000 sequentially, which speaks to the tremendous work and effectiveness of our recruitment team. Given our focus in recent years on accelerating pressure hiring in India, we've made meaningful progress on addressing our pyramid. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India for on-boarding and 2022. Retention and recruitment have our leadership\u2019s full attention.  We are continuing our comprehensive program to support our associates career growth and engagement to a range of initiatives that include: committed annual increases and evolved approach to promotions, job board, so associates can easily explore open leadership roles Company-wide, abundant new training and development programs, sustained communication with our commitment to belonging and inclusion across our Company and to society more broadly, And the continuing pursuit an ESG agenda which shows special meeting for our associates.  To this point earlier this year, we published our first the issue reports and set out on a path to reduce our emissions and increase our energy efficiency. Last week we announced Cognizant's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We plan to achieve this net zero goal through ongoing investments in renewable energy.  Building on our initial success in India, where a quarter of our energy has come from renewable sources since 2020. We will also be investing in new energy efficient technologies across our officers and data centers globally. In addition, we will extend our expertise in Cloud IoT and AI to help clients meet their sustainability goals.  In closing, while the industry faces an unprecedented competition for talent, during the third quarter, we attracted a record number of employees to Cognizant and stayed focus on delivering against our client commitments and our strategic repositioning. We're bullish on the industry and on an all-growing commercial momentum.  Jan and I look forward to discussing Cognizant's future with you at our November 18th investor briefing. With that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan over to you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Our Q3 revenue was $4.7 billion representing growth of approximately 12% or 11% at constant -currency. Revenue growth was led by digital, which grew 18% and represented 44% of total revenue for the quarter. As Brian mentioned earlier, our digital business operations practice area is also growing strongly.  Year-over-year growth includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services revenue increased approximately 4% in line with our expectations. We continue to make steady progress as we reposition this business and have seen recent improvement in bookings and pipeline. We continue to expect modest growth for this segment for the full year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 10%, again, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and demand for our integrated software solutions remains strong.  We also remain very pleased with our life sciences business, which grew double-digits organically year-over-year. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 18% driven by the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit grow in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities.  Retail and consumer goods, and travel and hospitality also grew double-digits year-over-year, with the both sectors experiencing  demand for digital services as they recovery from the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Segment growth also included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue.  Communications, Media, and Technology revenue grew 19%, of which approximately 500 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was led by our Technology business, where our work with digital native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio.  From a geographic perspective, North America grew approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by demand from healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments.  Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 16% year-over-year in constant-currency, led by growth in the U.K. We also experience strong growth in Germany and Australia driven impact. Recently completed acquisitions of ESG, mobility and Serbian, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact from the legal settlement, which if approved by the court, we'll resolve the previously disclosed 2016 securities class action lawsuit. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin declined approximately 10 basis points. Continued elevated attrition resulted in higher subcontractor recruiting, and other delivery costs.  Additionally, our recently completed acquisitions negatively impacted our margin, and we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth and modernize our core IT and securities infrastructure. These headwinds were partially offset by savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and 2021.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 25.6% and our adjusted tax rate was 26% towards the high end of our full-year guidance. Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.03 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.06. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion.  Free cash flow of -- in Q3 was $897 million, representing approximately 165% of net income and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion represents over 90% of net income. DSO of 72 days increased by one day sequentially, and is flat with the prior year period.  Management remains keenly focused on this metric as it is a key lever for free cash flow conversion in the future. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in line with our previously disclosed capital allocation framework.  During the quarter, we also spend cash of $57 million on acquisitions, bringing the year-to-date spend on acquisitions to over $700 million. Turning to guidance, for Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.79 billion representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, or 13.3% to 14.3% in constant currency.  Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 20 basis points impact, and inorganic contribution of approximately 310 basis points. As a reminder, Q4 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the $107 million charge related to our proposed financial services contract exit, which is expected to benefit Q4, 2021 year-over-year growth, compared by approximately 250 basis points.  At the midpoint of our Q4 revenue outlook, we expect full-year revenue of $18.5 billion, representing 11.1% growth or 9.8% growth in constant currency. With that, we're guiding towards the high-end of our prior full-year guidance. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 130 basis points impact, and includes 330 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue.  Our guidance also assumes continued momentum across healthcare, CMT, and products and resources, and a modest growth in financial services for the full year. Moving on to margins. Our full-year adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged at approximately 15.4%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas, including recruiting and subcontractor costs, in addition to higher wages for lateral hires.  We also continue to invest significantly in our people through increased compensation, rolling quarterly promotions for billable associates and training. As a reminder, our annual merit increase for the majority of our associates is effective October 1. This will impact our Q4 margin and implies a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin from Q3.  To partially offset these headwinds, we continue to moderate the pace of non-strategic SG & A spends. This leads to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.2 to $4.6 compared to the $4 to $4.06 previously. Our full-year outlook assumes interest income of approximately 30 million compared to $25 million to $30 million previously.  Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 5 million, 28 million, and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Both share count and tax rate are unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Tien - Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question.\nTien Tsin Huang : Thank you so much. I want to ask on the attrition and the gross margin lines and what to think about here, going into the fourth quarter gross margin, this quarter was actually pretty healthy despite this step-up in attrition that you had signaled to us.  So look looking ahead, what should we think about there with attrition and gross margin specifically and are you able to pass along price increases? Have you seen any delivery execution issues that kind of thing? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries : Hi, Tien - Tsin. It's Brian. And I'll possibly Jan maybe directly after this. Look, first of all, attrition is elevated when you're going into the quarter, it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter it will also remain elevated. However, we do expect some modest declines in attrition rate and that is healthy, we look naturally at resignations on a daily basis.  We think as we hopefully shown in the course of the year, we understand what's going on, what to expect from an attrition point of view. Clearly while the headline number is high, when you apply the rate of attrition to more industry standard definitions, such as a  12-month basis, but we think we are more in line with the industry in the low twenties.  As I think about this, we spent a tremendous amount of effort to try to address that both hearts and minds as well as compensation hearts and minds has less of an impact on margin compensation does. So just -- and when we think about hearts and minds, we're thinking about a sense of belonging, newness, celebrating success, career path discussions, training and development. And making sure that we have processes in place for people can actually get promoted more readily internally and so we've made a serious of adjustments to internal processes to facilitate that.  We've also really embraced the bottom of the pyramid after a few slower years at between 2017 and 19 or what we call GenC or fresher intake has increased meaningfully and that is also helping our pyramid and our ability to have good promotion capabilities this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll add 45,000 offers.  So I feel pretty good about what we're doing from an attrition point-of-view. The reality is however, we're in an industry that is facing unprecedented competition for talent. And we continue to see attrition in the same areas as we told. I previously, name we have skills as well as the bottom of the pyramid. On pricing and on margin implications, I will pass through to Jan.\nJan Siegmund: Maybe I'll start with the gross margin in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent to prior year. And obviously, a lot of in and out and clearly, we observed the impact of increased compensation onto the thing. But we had also positive effects like, for example, a modest shift in our digital revenues is helping us, overall acceleration of revenue growth has been a factor of helping our gross margin.  And a lot of ins and outs, and compare year-over-year because of the COVID situation. So you should expect, in the fourth quarter, pressure on our gross margins because we're implementing our compensation increase for the vast majority of our associates of having implemented October 1st.  So you do see some pressure on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. And clearly, we're working on all elements of curtailing that. But I think you will see net pressure. Pricing, I wanted to do two comments before I pass it back to Brian.  You know, of course, that the pricing takes some time to implement since clients have longer-term contracts, but when we -- when I will observe in particular, our digital business, I think I can say that our clients start to really see the value that Cognizant is delivering and understand the value that we can bring too.  So we're pleasantly satisfied, we are really happy with the situation that our core thesis about our strategy to shift to digital driving higher gross margin, is holding in helping us over the medium-term on the gross margin side. Back to you, Brian.\nBrian Humphries : Actually you've largely touch upon what I was going to say. I think the implications of digital is of course important from our pricing point of view, but also the competitors against which we're going up, enables us to be a very strong challenger brand; and so we have pricing, I would say, accretion as opposed to dilution.  And then just one other important point. Over the last few years, many people have asked me how I think about structured deals or captive takeout\u2019s. We've naturally, heavily embraced Digital, and our growth rate in Digital has been twice that of the industry over the last two years.  One of the benefit of Digital is, of course, the smaller contract durations you get, given the nature of the work you're performing, which ensures we haven't actually been locked into multiyear pricing dimensions as part of a 5 or an 8-year contract. That's actually, in a strange way, or that's to be quite favorable for us going forward. But all of this is heavy lifting. We have to get right in the quarters ahead, but we feel that we're on the right track.\nTien Tsin Huang : Great. Thank you for the complete answers, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may proceed with your question.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you very much. Good evening. I wanted to ask a similar question, Brian. But I'm going to go at a different direction. You used the word unprecedented and I agree, it does seem to be unprecedented attrition. But I'm wondering what slows it. You've talked about specific steps that Cognizant's taking, but it's clearly an industry problem. And the other side is, does it require a slowdown in revenues across Cognizant its competitors in order for attrition to come down? But I'm just wondering, what are some of the industry forces that might help alleviate some of this pressure? And then Brian, I will just go ahead and ask my second question since they're related. As you're facing such unprecedented attrition, how do you think about the trade-offs that you need to make related to gross versus margins, as you look out over the next couple of quarters, or even the next year?\nBrian Humphries : Hey, Keith. Let me start with the second question, given it's fresh in mind. Look we've already started making some of those trade-offs, some growth versus margins. I think the reality is, I'm delighted with our team and our recruitment engine was really executing extremely well in the last few quarters and we'll continue to execute well going forward and hence, we've had a headcount increase sequentially of 17,000 by the way, which excludes subcontractors, which also grew.  But the reality is we don't have enough headcount to fulfill our potential. And therefore we've been faced with choice points, which clients to serve, which deals to chase, where we walk away, where we're willing to make pricing stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do given to the demand, supply and balance.  So that is already underway, Keith. I will say in the same vein, we're really delighted with the commercial momentum, we have bookings growth of 24% in the quarter, which brings year-to-date up to mid-teens -- on the back of mid-teens bookings growth last year, tells me that we have actually really turned a corner in terms of commercial momentum. So those trade-offs are underway.  I'd like nothing more to accelerate hiring from current levels so that we can really fulfill against our true potential, but it is  time despite all the net ads and they were record levels in the quarter, we have enough attrition as does the rest of the industry to mitigate that. With regards to the first question around the industry forces that will alleviate attrition. Look, it's a very difficult question to answer it.  The reality is, I don't see immediate line-of-sight to this. I foresee elevated attrition in the industry in the coming quarters. I think the only winner in times like this is actual individual employee because companies like us don't win from this, clients don't win from this. And as such, hopefully, this will right itself over time.  And hence, our focus both much on a compensation were extreme. We stood up a war room from a retention point of view, about 9 months ago at this stage, and we spent an extraordinary amount of time on the hearts and minds angle. And I personally now spend 1 hour per day with 5 -- groups of 5 or 6 employees that are deep into the organization to make sure we're hearing demand, understanding what's on your mind, validating that they understand what we're up to.  I will say I like the fact that we're back to double-digit growth more sustainably, because that helps us get a little bit more swagger back in Cognizant. And, obviously, it demonstrates ability for us to benefit our clients as much of our clients are employees, and talk about the fact that they will have career advancement opportunities and we will have gross margin opportunities to invest in their careers and training and development, et cetera.  So time will tell what's going to happen overtime, but we've really -- we're doing what we can do. And core to that is also via, let's say, the re-invigoration of our fresher program, which had stalled, but I think at this stage we're starting to get our pyramid back into the right shape after a few years of being off kilter.\nKeith Bachman: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. You may proceed with your question.\nRod Bourgeois: Okay. Great. Thank you. Brian, when you started your turnaround effort, you made international revenues a big priority, which had been actually something Cognizant had somewhat struggled with over the years. Your international growth is outperforming in these latest results.  So I wanted to see if you could speak to the levers that you're pulling to help with the international revenue progress. And I love to get your sense of whether you're sort of sustainably on a path to increase the international revenue mix at this point going forward.\nBrian Humphries : It's a great question, Rod, because we're very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which isn't relevant, just on a total corporation level, but also internationally. So scaling our international capabilities is something I'm 100% focused on. Today is just 26% of our revenue. And so if you think about our footprint internationally, our brand internationally, and our operations, they are in need of scaling. And it's not just revenue scaling, but it's also our delivery capabilities overseas, both in terms of near-shore and onshore, that will enable our shift to digital, but also, I would say its very core to our desire to build a global delivery network where we can provide greater business continuity capabilities for clients as well.  We're executing well against those initiatives, we've hired largely refreshed a lot of the international leadership team. Very senior hires in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, the Nordics; the people we've targeted are well-connected into local industry, they understand the local markets.  And I would say the impact of that is now becoming more and more evident, not just in strong revenue growth in the third quarter, but also in year-to-date this year, across Australia, U.K., Germany in particular. But also as I think about the bookings momentum we have internationally, the year-to-date in Q3 bookings on our international businesses is well above the Company average.  Now those people are bringing followership both from a client point-of-view, as well as from an employee point-of-view, our ability to attract talent is relevant there, but they also give me confidence that I'm investing M&A dollars behind senior leaders, who will take post-merger integration activities seriously.  And as you've seen in the last -- earlier part of this year, we acquired Serbian in Australia, New Zealand, and ESG mobility in Germany. So it goes back to having confidence in the team and having a team who take their responsibility seriously, and a team that's fundamentally connected into partnership ecosystem as well as the client network.  While we are different internationally, but Rod, I expect we will continue to double down in that arena too. In the notion of industry alignment, we're very strong from an industry perspective in North America. Healthcare is obviously a great example of that in the payer provider space.  But as we scale into Europe and Asia, our largest countries, the UK where we are aligned by industry. But actually some of the country leaders that we've hired now are embracing more of an industry alignment in those countries as well, perhaps not across all industries in every country. But there are major industries that we are aligning behind.  And I think that is the way to go to get after these market opportunities internationally. So not just my expecting, Rod, to maintain this level of growth, my hope is to accelerate our growth internationally in the years ahead. And we'll certainly talk more about that on November 18th at the Investor Summit.\nRod Bourgeois: Very helpful. Hey, I want to ask across the pipeline, particularly about large deals. And I guess I'm wondering, are you significantly pursuing extra-large deals in your sales pipeline, or are you focusing more on mid-sized and smaller deals?  And I'm really asking to see if you are somewhat biased away from the mega deals given some times the risks that they entail, and given that there's a lot of other deals out there right now, given the breadth of demand that exists?\nBrian Humphries : Look, I've made no qualms about the fact that my priority was to expose Cognizant to higher-growth categories, notably digital and international markets. So if I focus on digital, the nature of the work we do ends up positioning us against smaller contract .  And from my perspective, I agree with the inference in your question, this is a resource constrained environment and putting valuable resources against digital is much more interesting for me than putting them against captive or structured deals where you may have an  compare for one year or two, but thereafter you're in a book of business that you have to work very hard to grow.  I will say, when I think about our booking, our win rates on our pipelines, I have nothing but good thoughts. Bookings were balanced by industry, by geography. If I think about even within the digital work we are doing, we have actually seen a little more momentum in the 50 million plus category on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that to continue into fourth quarter as well.  And that's different from $500 million or $1 billion deals, but these are very healthy digital type deals for us. And all of this has led us to be in a position now with bookings  24% year-over-year in Q3 to have a book-to-bill ratio that has now solidly in the 1.2 range. So I feel good about that, I will say the CEO, the enemy is when you have clients that are indecisive, and that is not the case at this moment in time.  Pipeline velocity is strong, it's fast. That's why I feel very good about our position. I think the strategic choices we made a number of years ago were the right choices we're executing against that. I think will bear the fruit of that labor in the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. You may proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks a lot, guys. Good stuff here. Brian, I can really break from talking and ask Jan a one-year in kind of question, you've been in your seat as CFO now, at Cognizant for a little over a year. Can you just give a quick look back from the CFO seat, what you feel like has been going well in the last year and then what your personal priorities are for the CFO organization going forward? Thanks.\nJan Siegmund: That's an unexpected question. Actually the -- Lisa, obviously,\nLisa Ellis: Well I can go back to asking about attrition if you'd like.\nJan Siegmund: No, I actually I do appreciate, I do appreciate the question. The translation of our 4 strategic priorities into operational measures and controlled processes is obviously a big endeavor for a multinational organization like Cognizant, and the finance organization was really laser-focused in supporting those four strategic priorities that Brian has been talking about.  I'll give you example from when you scale and expand your sales force and distribution capabilities, more effective measures on the effectiveness and results of that sales force are required, and I think you have seen this with improving disclosure and our bookings club. So you just see the surface of the effort behind that to drive -- improve transparency not only for us, but also for the street.  Similar initiatives have been underway for supporting our pricing and analytics capability relative to driving relevance to clients and ensuring that we deliver value to our clients, etc. Throughout the fourth, I wanted  trough all -- explain through all four initiatives, so what we're doing.  But that has been really the primary focus of the work and I have to say, I'm pleased because in the outcome, you have kind of experienced Cognizant as an organization that has made good in the last couple of quarters on our promises.  And that's how I measure ourselves really in the end, can we fulfill the financial commitments that we make to our shareholders And in terms of fulfilling our expectations, that has worked out with a lot of work pretty well, I think, particularly in the last half year where we have faced that really -- that changed industry with high attrition rates.  I remain personally excited about that opportunity. It's a Company that is changing, that is winning in the marketplace and you can feel that the energy is visibly accelerating over time. And that's part to -- it's fun to be part of that team.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then my follow-up is on the technology partnerships side. I think Brian; you've mentioned the Hyperscalers as a priority a number of times. Can you just give us sense for some of the other priority areas that you guys are focused on in terms of building technology partnerships?\nJan Siegmund: Yeah. Lisa, look. Some of the hyperscalers are obviously omnipresent, extremely powerful, and the platform scales into various different technologies. Cloud migration immediately gets you into data modernization, AI, machine learning, IoT, etc.  But then beyond that, we have some of the traditional partners we've had for years, some of which were stronger than others, the Oracle, DSA P, ISVs of the world, but we've certainly been a huge focus as well on what I would call next-generation leaders, companies like ServiceNow, companies like Salesforce, Workday. As a reminder, in the last year-and-a-half, we acquired collaborative solutions to scale a Workday practice.  We've also done 3 acquisitions in Salesforce. We have meaningfully changed our position with Salesforce. I was in a recent  with the Salesforce leadership team and they were singing our phrases in terms of how our position in Salesforce has exponentially grown. And then we will continue to do acquisitions in those areas as well that are aligned to our higher-growth categories.  Voltus set up 3 business groups behind the hyperscalers, though it's not lip service, it is true organization, we take it very seriously. I actually see the hyperscalers now focusing more and more towards industry alignment, and Cognizant, since it's our strength, particularly in healthcare and financial services, is naturally of interest to those.  Now, there are individual cases where you have industry-specific plays. It could be Pega Guidewire, Temenos, Duck Creek, etc. Naturally, they are relevant to individual industries within Cognizant, but on a more horizontal nature, is to companies I've referenced. And then of course in our operations business, which I'm very proud of, we've done a fantastic job over the last two years as we exited content moderation.  And frankly got the business back to meet the high-teams growth. And they have very strong partnerships across some of the high PA players in particular. Automation anywhere  in present etc.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. On Margin, can you give us a sense of the magnitude associated with some of the larger strategic investments that you've had a step up in 2021? And specifically, I'm referring to things like the incremental recruiting of the structure, increased S&M campaigns, the M&A dilution pressure because trying to frame the level of catch-up investment in the business this year that may not require such an uptick as we think forward.\nBrian Humphries : I want to be careful in giving you too much detail that it was going to be hard to interpret over time. But off the margin pressure that we have seen to the growth in the SG&A approximately 50% or so, is due to M&A activity. This could be upfront deal costs, this could be deal-related expenses, and the higher SG &A load that some of the M&A transactions carry with them.  So that has been a meaningful pressure for us, let's say maybe in the range of a 100 -- around 100 basis points or so. And then the rest of the pressure that we have seen is kind of split evenly between three major areas, I would say. Area number one is our IT modernization. That's clear it's starting to stabilize and that has put pressure on it. We had investments into our HR and recruiting organization in order to scale our hiring activity. And thirdly, our investments into our sales force and marketing capabilities. Those would be roughly in even , I think it's a fair amount to say, and some of those are now starting to , that's kind of what we are starting to anticipate and plateau. We do not want to reduce those expenses obviously because they are important to us; but we have found, I think levels that are allowing us to have a more moderated SG&A development going forward.  You will see more detail around that, obviously in our November meeting. But the third quarter is a little bit of an indication on what's happening here basically. Because we had still growth in these strategic investment areas, but we have started to curtail that growth in more traditional SG&A areas to offset that. And you can see that the  has started to bend a little bit, more work to be done. But it really developed as I would have expected in the third quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you for that. That's good detail. And then just follow-up on the better non-digital business performance. Can you just dig in on what you're seeing as a reason for that, and is it sustainable?\nJan Siegmund: Bryan, there are multiple elements at play there. One of the bigger ones from a weighted impact is actually our business operation -- digital business operations business, which has been growing into strong teams within that we have elements that we classify as digital and are in our digital mix and there are elements that we don't classify digital. We have tended to be quite disciplined. We changed the definition of digital over two years ago at this stage and we've maintained that ever since. But there are other areas including a non-digital element of our AI and analytics portfolio. Again, we're being disciplined. They're elements that we view as digital, and elements that we view as more traditional business intelligence, etc. And then on top of that, we have elements within some of our enterprise applications business, and CIS business that have grown as well. Our goal, to be very honest, in a multiyear basis, is to mitigate the risk of declines in the non-digital business and hopefully maintain some growth in the non-digital business.  If we manage to do that, which requires us to be very disciplined from a pricing, from a renewal point-of-view; that will frankly complement what we expect to be very strong growth in digital, and therefore its goodness for the entire corporation. But at this moment in time, that is something that I think you've seen in competitive earnings as well. If you extrapolate the digital growth they have versus the total Company growth, particularly for those who suggest have a very large portion of their revenue that is digital, you will be able to truly extrapolate that they are seeing declines in their legacy businesses.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: That's great, and thanks for all the detail today. And certainly pleased to see the control on margins, etc., in spite of a very odd environment. So I'm wondering on the control around SG&A. And I know you've kind of addressed this but, I'm wondering, is there a point at which, you know, trying to control for those margins, etc., starts to cut into the proverbial muscle?  And I think, Jan, you mentioned a few areas where you've shown improvement, but are you all the way where you want to be in areas like recruiting, etc., so that you really can continue to march forward even if you're controlling a little bit more judiciously expenses?\nJan Siegmund: Look, I think Brian explained it earlier in the call and we iterate it. We keenly focus on accelerating our growth rate. So we see momentum organically as we see -- we want to continue with our capital allocation program as we have announced it. So the acceleration of revenue growth is front and center in our view. We have ample of opportunity. And as such, we have made decisions to; of course, support the opportunities that we promised to our clients with staffing.  So HR will be funded as needed and we're actually very proud about the amount of scaling that we achieved and the amount of change in policy of accelerating the hiring of fresher\u2019s, optimizing our permit, scaling training programs; at our size it's a really important and complicated effort that that team executed well, and I will of course, or the Company will provide the funding for that as it's part of our growth engine.  But there are other elements that need themselves more natural to scale in certain IT components, certain marketing components, certain finance and classic support functions in the SG&A to  themselves for scaling. And we're going to continue to fund obviously, our sales force in the distribution area, I'm actually pretty pleased we have a good combination of growth and resources, but also of improvement in productivity in those sales forces.  And we have been busy at work to optimize our go-to market strategies, and I think we have more opportunities in that space, but also we will be funding organic growth appropriately to capture those opportunities. So I'm not too religious here relative to what the exact percentage growth of SG&A is, but you get the philosophy enough in my answer.\nJames Faucette: Yeah, I know, for sure. And then as we're trying to model things out, and I realize it's a super dynamic world, but how are you planning for things like timing and impact of return of T&E, what that will look like? I'm just trying to make sure that at least we understand what your planning assumptions may be, like, going into the next couple of quarters.\nJan Siegmund: Yeah. I'd be excited about talking about the next year in the next quarter and -- but -- and I'm not expecting any meaningful increase in my travel expense for this quarter, but to be a little bit more forthcoming. Obviously, the decisions of the return to work are going to be affected by really a myriad of factors: our client\u2019s need, our associate\u2019s preferences, the health situation by country, and it is really dynamic.  So we're evaluating this basically on a monthly basis and at the current point, we are still, as all competitors are, largely in a virtual environment which has worked actually pretty well for us. So we are planning to think about that as a strategic opportunity that meets the needs of all those stakeholders going forward.  And I have to say that is an -- it's a work in progress, that we really evaluating and there will be a gradual decision to the new business model that will be different than the historic business model.\nJames Faucette: Thanks for those comments, Jan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, thanks for asking -- for letting me ask a question here. And congrats on very strong key numbers. Two questions. One, Digital was up 18%, I think you said. It's still kind of trailing some of the pure-play digital mains.  Brian, what do you need to do to get to those growth levels of some of your peers? And then on the attrition side, are we at a point where we're feeling comfortable that the employees that we're losing are not at the senior level because we just had some -- in the past, as you know, you've had some high-caliber kind of departures from the Company? Thanks a lot.\nBrian Humphries : Listen, I think we've got a great senior leadership team these days. Most of the senior changes are , as I would view as to be very much in business as usual these days, retirements, internal promotions, some performance orientation, but this is kind of classic Fortune 200 Company land at this stage. I got to say, I'm delighted with the Leadership team we have around us these days.  We're getting back into a growth trajectory after a few years where our backlog and our pipeline haven\u2019t been -- on bookings hasn't been as strong as it needed to be. And I think you've seen united leadership team here orienting the Company towards a evolve business model, both geographically as well as the offerings that we ultimately solutions and deliver.  So that's not a concern to mind anymore. And of course, we'll always be press article at the individuals with a Company with 320,000 employees. Please don't get distracted by that on not. And with regards to digital, of course, it all depends on the portion of the portfolio you would look at, our digital growth with 18% within our portfolio.  If I look at our digital engineering business, our growth rate is equivalent to the pure plays that are announcing their results. If I look at our IoT business, the digital growth is as fast as the pure plays out there, same for our cloud business or digital experience business. So as I said, we tried to be extremely disciplined in the definition of digital, and in many ways we penalized ourselves.  But as a broader Company within the categories we look at, and I'll talk a little bit of this in the November 18th Investor Summit, we have some gems in our portfolio that are growing at significant rates, and ultimately that will continue to drive the growth rate of the Company forward.  A little bit that the mix shift this last few quarters, that has been hanging around in the mid-40s is somewhat reflective of numerator -denominator, where the non-digital business has actually had some better growth than anticipated.\nMoshe Katri: Thanks, good job.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey, Brian. Hi, Jan. I just wanted to get a little bit deeper into, sort of, the Digital business. You've mentioned, for example, that you're doing very well with digital engineering, digital experience. Speaking with some of your competitors, they often bring up more so application modernization as an area.  So from your perspective in the areas that you are not quite growing as fast in the digital arena, is that choice? Or is that the modernization deals you just necessarily have to go after large carve-out type stuff and that's not what you want? I mean, could you talk a little bit about the strategy versus availability of talent versus where you are?\nBrian Humphries : Well, I just think, again, it goes back to the definitions that companies have for digital. We've been quite intentional on being restrictive on what is digital, including our digital businesses, our TriZetto platform business, which is growing at a very healthy double-digit pace these days, significantly up from prior years. But it's not growing at the rate of maybe a digital engineering Company pure-play because it's not at all the same business or business models.  So it's important to recognize that everybody's definition of digital and what is within that differs. I would say I'm very pleased with our momentum in digital, we can always do better. We strive to do better. But our exposure to Digital exposes us to higher growth categories as a corporation, ultimately, higher margin categories as a corporation. It puts us up against a different set of competitors where we have pricing dynamics that will be favorable for Cognizant's pricing.  And ultimately most importantly for me, it makes us much more relevant to clients because we are becoming much more intimate with them as we become part of their transformation journey.  And as I go around and speak to clients around the world when we articulate our strategy and what we're doing, and start sharing some of the references we have,  clients are very open to proceeding with the next meeting to better understand what we have, today have optionality versus some of the incumbent. So I feel ultimately that we're in the right spaces. We will continue to double down, of course, there are certain industry where digital is a higher portion of our mix than others.  And there are certain geographies where I want to accelerate our digital capabilities, not just back to Rod's question earlier, the international markets where our digital mix is lower than it needs to be, because historically we spent a lot more of our focus on structured deals in those geographies, but also the delivery capabilities both near shore and onshore to fulfill any demand that we create in our commercial teams internationally, we need to further extend our capabilities there.  And we're working on a number of things that hopefully we can announce in the foreseeable future that will hopefully give you confidence that we're doing the right thing in that regard as well.\nJan Siegmund: Maybe I add numbers for illustration that could be helpful. As you know, of course, our digital revenue is exceeding our overall Company growth and we are gaining share in digital revenues. But for me, a good example of the value of strategic focuses.  Also, our focus on the four digital battlegrounds that we have really identified; and those are the data monetization, the Cloud business, our IoT and digital engineering businesses, and those priority -- prioritized areas within digital actually also meaningfully outgrowing our overall digital revenue growth.  So I think for a Company to establish that focus and then executing in those focus areas in a thoughtful way is a good sign, and as ample opportunities to expand those things for the long run, but at least we're seeing in our numbers really, the results of exactly what we wanted that strategy to be.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Very good to know, maybe a little bit of a symmetrical end to the call. Attrition question. Any details you could provide, I think in the past you have indicated for example the geographic lit was high in India, Eastern Europe is fine, any details by either level or vertical or geography that you could provide to kind of help understand attrition? Thank you.\nJan Siegmund: Look, it's -- I would say if I think about where it is voluntary attrition is highest, the mid-junior levels of the permit primarily in India, it's not just in one location in India, it's broad-based, but also against certain skills, whether it's cloud. Here we're talking Hyperscalers are leading SaaS players like Salesforce, digital engineering, full-stack engineers, job at Dot Netangular or just across data, AI and ML technologies. We're seeing significant attrition in those areas. And it's just a hot labor market. It is extremely consistent, I think in the country you've seen from our peers in the industry. And as I said earlier, we're working very hard to mitigate that. We do expect attrition to fall, sequentially on a year-over-year basis from where it is in Q3, based on the net resignations we've seen, and based on what we're seeing following the efforts we've had around hearts and minds on compensation.  But at this moment in time, we're still anticipating elevated attrition in the coming years, and to the question that we received earlier, we're funding in our P&L, what it takes to mitigate that. Those compensation measures as well as our recruitment team have been doing an incredible job for us and frankly, we expect to meaningfully scale our headcount in the coming year.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks. Look forward to connecting with everyone on November 18th.\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant's Technology Solutions Q3, 2021 Earnings Conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering revenue of $4.7 billion up 11.8% year-over-year or 11% in constant currency. Bookings growth, a key leading indicator, accelerated to 24% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.2 times revenue and a trailing 12-month basis underscores our commercial momentum. I'm grateful to our teams around the world for their resourcefulness in meeting our client commitments despite a challenging labor market. We delivered solid sequential adjusted operating margin expansion in the third quarter as we offset the cost of increased hiring with cost discipline elsewhere. I'm also pleased with our progress against our key strategic initiatives.  For example, third quarter digital revenue grew 18% year-over-year. Digital represents 44% of our overall revenue mix. We expect this percentage to grow in future periods, positioning Cognizant for both top-line momentum and margin expansion. Moreover, the intimacy of our C-suite engagement increases as we serve clients in their digital transformations. Better-than-expected growth in our non-digital business impacted our digital mix progression, but is nonetheless a welcome outcome. During the third quarter, we saw continued strong top-line momentum in our digital business operations practice, reflecting our differentiated offerings for digital natives, our BPaaS leadership position in healthcare, and our strength in intelligence process automation solutions.  We recently announced Cognizant Neuro, a simpler and more effective way for clients to achieve the full potential of intelligent process automation and speed time to results. Everest Group, a leading industry analyst firm, recently recognized Cognizant Neuro as an exciting development to enable automation at scale.  Moving to industry segments. Financial services ongoing recovery continued, with growth of 4.3% year-over-year in constant currency in line with our expectations. We posted strong double-digit growth year-over-year in constant currency in products and resources and in communications, media, and technology.  Within products and resources, we continued to deliver excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities, as well as across retail, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality, which have recovered to pre -pandemic levels. In communications, media, and technology, we continue to lead with our digital engineering capability to win transformation deals, while leveraging our alliances to be a premier cloud transformation partner.  In healthcare, we had another solid quarter, achieving 9.8% constant-currency growth. Momentum in life sciences continued, demand across payers remain strong, and we're beginning to see an uptick in demand across providers as they look to digital technologies to help reduce operating costs and strengthened new channels for delivering care. Our products business saw a continued double-digit growth in Q3.  We're expanding our footprint in the healthcare market and adding new growth members on our platforms. We're also well underway with our digital transformation of our products, including the launch of our connected interoperability solutions to help clients provide secure, real-time data access, and meet compliance deadlines.  We're proud of the work we're doing in partnership with clients like Parkland Community Health Plan. Parkland was looking for better ways to meet the growing needs of its medically underserved populations in Texas.  As a better managers health insurance claims, member transactions, and network of physicians and hospitals, our TriZetto QNXT Core Administration platform, delivered in a BPaaS model is enabling delivery of care management, claims processing, member services, provider services, and quality on a single platform, thereby enhancing care coordination and member experiences.  Our healthcare business is a hugely strategic asset. I'm pleased with the progress we've made accelerating growth in healthcare, and I'm optimistic in our future prospects as healthcare companies modernize their business to address the need for enhanced client experiences, including virtual care solutions. Let's turn now to Strategy, including our digital ambitions.  I remain bullish on both the macro demand environment and Cognizant's growing momentum in Digital. Clients continue to accelerate their investment in digital operating models to improve their customer and employee experiences, and modernize their operations through data automation and cloud.  While most companies have launched digital initiatives, few have made the shift to a fully-digital operating model. Cognizant is now one of the few global firms that can serve clients across all stages of their digital transformation, from modernizing their technology foundation to implementing agile workflows.  This is in part a result of investing approximately $3 billion in mergers and acquisitions over the past few years to broaden our portfolio, while strengthening our relationships with hyperscalers and key partners. Good client example is Cabot Corporation, a global leader in specialty chemicals and performance materials, who recently engaged us to help transform their digital operating model.  We'll be providing application development and maintenance, as well as infrastructure and operation services. And enabling Cabot to create an enhanced digital experience that drives value for its customers and employees. Gaining our international operations is another strategic priority.  And during the Third Quarter, we grew bookings and revenue solidly in both Europe and rest of world, with the highlight being 19% constant-currency revenue growth in the United Kingdom. We remain optimistic on our international market prospects and aim to accelerate growth as we invest in our talents, brand, partnerships, and operations.  Global Biopharma leader Sanofi has selected Cognizant as a strategic partner to deploy an omnichannel customer engagement model; the solution will enable their customer-facing teams to engage with healthcare professionals for the new digital channels, provide them more personalized content, and also suggest next best actions.  Cognizant deployed the cloud-based CRN, integrated marketing automation and Intelligent Data Platform to the first 18 markets in just eight months. And for Her Majesties revenue and customs, the UK government's tax authority, we're providing broad technology expertise across its Pega technology SPAC, and enabling Pega application development and operational support that will facilitate case management and customer service applications.  Moving on now to the intensifying competition for talent across multiple industries. The demand-supply imbalance in our ore industry remains particularly acute. Third quarter voluntary attrition reached 33% on an annualized basis, or 24% on a trailing 12-month basis. As a reminder, when we measure attrition, we count the entire Company, including trainees and corporate across IT services and BPO.  Despite elevated attrition, we increased our net headcount in Q3 by over 17,000 sequentially, which speaks to the tremendous work and effectiveness of our recruitment team. Given our focus in recent years on accelerating pressure hiring in India, we've made meaningful progress on addressing our pyramid. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make offers to 45,000 new graduates in India for on-boarding and 2022. Retention and recruitment have our leadership's full attention.  We are continuing our comprehensive program to support our associates career growth and engagement to a range of initiatives that include: committed annual increases and evolved approach to promotions, job board, so associates can easily explore open leadership roles Company-wide, abundant new training and development programs, sustained communication with our commitment to belonging and inclusion across our Company and to society more broadly, And the continuing pursuit an ESG agenda which shows special meeting for our associates.  To this point earlier this year, we published our first the issue reports and set out on a path to reduce our emissions and increase our energy efficiency. Last week we announced Cognizant's commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We plan to achieve this net zero goal through ongoing investments in renewable energy.  Building on our initial success in India, where a quarter of our energy has come from renewable sources since 2020. We will also be investing in new energy efficient technologies across our officers and data centers globally. In addition, we will extend our expertise in Cloud IoT and AI to help clients meet their sustainability goals.  In closing, while the industry faces an unprecedented competition for talent, during the third quarter, we attracted a record number of employees to Cognizant and stayed focus on delivering against our client commitments and our strategic repositioning. We're bullish on the industry and on an all-growing commercial momentum.  Jan and I look forward to discussing Cognizant's future with you at our November 18th investor briefing. With that, I will turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan over to you. Hi, Tien - Tsin. It's Brian. And I'll possibly Jan maybe directly after this. Look, first of all, attrition is elevated when you're going into the quarter, it would remain elevated. We expect going into the fourth quarter it will also remain elevated. However, we do expect some modest declines in attrition rate and that is healthy, we look naturally at resignations on a daily basis.  We think as we hopefully shown in the course of the year, we understand what's going on, what to expect from an attrition point of view. Clearly while the headline number is high, when you apply the rate of attrition to more industry standard definitions, such as a  12-month basis, but we think we are more in line with the industry in the low twenties.  As I think about this, we spent a tremendous amount of effort to try to address that both hearts and minds as well as compensation hearts and minds has less of an impact on margin compensation does. So just -- and when we think about hearts and minds, we're thinking about a sense of belonging, newness, celebrating success, career path discussions, training and development. And making sure that we have processes in place for people can actually get promoted more readily internally and so we've made a serious of adjustments to internal processes to facilitate that.  We've also really embraced the bottom of the pyramid after a few slower years at between 2017 and 19 or what we call GenC or fresher intake has increased meaningfully and that is also helping our pyramid and our ability to have good promotion capabilities this year. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll add 45,000 offers.  So I feel pretty good about what we're doing from an attrition point-of-view. The reality is however, we're in an industry that is facing unprecedented competition for talent. And we continue to see attrition in the same areas as we told. I previously, name we have skills as well as the bottom of the pyramid. On pricing and on margin implications, I will pass through to Jan. Actually you've largely touch upon what I was going to say. I think the implications of digital is of course important from our pricing point of view, but also the competitors against which we're going up, enables us to be a very strong challenger brand; and so we have pricing, I would say, accretion as opposed to dilution.  And then just one other important point. Over the last few years, many people have asked me how I think about structured deals or captive takeout's. We've naturally, heavily embraced Digital, and our growth rate in Digital has been twice that of the industry over the last two years.  One of the benefit of Digital is, of course, the smaller contract durations you get, given the nature of the work you're performing, which ensures we haven't actually been locked into multiyear pricing dimensions as part of a 5 or an 8-year contract. That's actually, in a strange way, or that's to be quite favorable for us going forward. But all of this is heavy lifting. We have to get right in the quarters ahead, but we feel that we're on the right track. Hey, Keith. Let me start with the second question, given it's fresh in mind. Look we've already started making some of those trade-offs, some growth versus margins. I think the reality is, I'm delighted with our team and our recruitment engine was really executing extremely well in the last few quarters and we'll continue to execute well going forward and hence, we've had a headcount increase sequentially of 17,000 by the way, which excludes subcontractors, which also grew.  But the reality is we don't have enough headcount to fulfill our potential. And therefore we've been faced with choice points, which clients to serve, which deals to chase, where we walk away, where we're willing to make pricing stances that may put a deal at risk, but it's the appropriate thing to do given to the demand, supply and balance.  So that is already underway, Keith. I will say in the same vein, we're really delighted with the commercial momentum, we have bookings growth of 24% in the quarter, which brings year-to-date up to mid-teens -- on the back of mid-teens bookings growth last year, tells me that we have actually really turned a corner in terms of commercial momentum. So those trade-offs are underway.  I'd like nothing more to accelerate hiring from current levels so that we can really fulfill against our true potential, but it is  time despite all the net ads and they were record levels in the quarter, we have enough attrition as does the rest of the industry to mitigate that. With regards to the first question around the industry forces that will alleviate attrition. Look, it's a very difficult question to answer it.  The reality is, I don't see immediate line-of-sight to this. I foresee elevated attrition in the industry in the coming quarters. I think the only winner in times like this is actual individual employee because companies like us don't win from this, clients don't win from this. And as such, hopefully, this will right itself over time.  And hence, our focus both much on a compensation were extreme. We stood up a war room from a retention point of view, about 9 months ago at this stage, and we spent an extraordinary amount of time on the hearts and minds angle. And I personally now spend 1 hour per day with 5 -- groups of 5 or 6 employees that are deep into the organization to make sure we're hearing demand, understanding what's on your mind, validating that they understand what we're up to.  I will say I like the fact that we're back to double-digit growth more sustainably, because that helps us get a little bit more swagger back in Cognizant. And, obviously, it demonstrates ability for us to benefit our clients as much of our clients are employees, and talk about the fact that they will have career advancement opportunities and we will have gross margin opportunities to invest in their careers and training and development, et cetera.  So time will tell what's going to happen overtime, but we've really -- we're doing what we can do. And core to that is also via, let's say, the re-invigoration of our fresher program, which had stalled, but I think at this stage we're starting to get our pyramid back into the right shape after a few years of being off kilter. It's a great question, Rod, because we're very often spend a lot of time on one of our other strategic postures, which is around accelerating our digital footprint, which isn't relevant, just on a total corporation level, but also internationally. So scaling our international capabilities is something I'm 100% focused on. Today is just 26% of our revenue. And so if you think about our footprint internationally, our brand internationally, and our operations, they are in need of scaling. And it's not just revenue scaling, but it's also our delivery capabilities overseas, both in terms of near-shore and onshore, that will enable our shift to digital, but also, I would say its very core to our desire to build a global delivery network where we can provide greater business continuity capabilities for clients as well.  We're executing well against those initiatives, we've hired largely refreshed a lot of the international leadership team. Very senior hires in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Japan, the Nordics; the people we've targeted are well-connected into local industry, they understand the local markets.  And I would say the impact of that is now becoming more and more evident, not just in strong revenue growth in the third quarter, but also in year-to-date this year, across Australia, U.K., Germany in particular. But also as I think about the bookings momentum we have internationally, the year-to-date in Q3 bookings on our international businesses is well above the Company average.  Now those people are bringing followership both from a client point-of-view, as well as from an employee point-of-view, our ability to attract talent is relevant there, but they also give me confidence that I'm investing M&A dollars behind senior leaders, who will take post-merger integration activities seriously.  And as you've seen in the last -- earlier part of this year, we acquired Serbian in Australia, New Zealand, and ESG mobility in Germany. So it goes back to having confidence in the team and having a team who take their responsibility seriously, and a team that's fundamentally connected into partnership ecosystem as well as the client network.  While we are different internationally, but Rod, I expect we will continue to double down in that arena too. In the notion of industry alignment, we're very strong from an industry perspective in North America. Healthcare is obviously a great example of that in the payer provider space.  But as we scale into Europe and Asia, our largest countries, the UK where we are aligned by industry. But actually some of the country leaders that we've hired now are embracing more of an industry alignment in those countries as well, perhaps not across all industries in every country. But there are major industries that we are aligning behind.  And I think that is the way to go to get after these market opportunities internationally. So not just my expecting, Rod, to maintain this level of growth, my hope is to accelerate our growth internationally in the years ahead. And we'll certainly talk more about that on November 18th at the Investor Summit. Look, I've made no qualms about the fact that my priority was to expose Cognizant to higher-growth categories, notably digital and international markets. So if I focus on digital, the nature of the work we do ends up positioning us against smaller contract .  And from my perspective, I agree with the inference in your question, this is a resource constrained environment and putting valuable resources against digital is much more interesting for me than putting them against captive or structured deals where you may have an  compare for one year or two, but thereafter you're in a book of business that you have to work very hard to grow.  I will say, when I think about our booking, our win rates on our pipelines, I have nothing but good thoughts. Bookings were balanced by industry, by geography. If I think about even within the digital work we are doing, we have actually seen a little more momentum in the 50 million plus category on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that to continue into fourth quarter as well.  And that's different from $500 million or $1 billion deals, but these are very healthy digital type deals for us. And all of this has led us to be in a position now with bookings  24% year-over-year in Q3 to have a book-to-bill ratio that has now solidly in the 1.2 range. So I feel good about that, I will say the CEO, the enemy is when you have clients that are indecisive, and that is not the case at this moment in time.  Pipeline velocity is strong, it's fast. That's why I feel very good about our position. I think the strategic choices we made a number of years ago were the right choices we're executing against that. I think will bear the fruit of that labor in the coming years. I want to be careful in giving you too much detail that it was going to be hard to interpret over time. But off the margin pressure that we have seen to the growth in the SG&A approximately 50% or so, is due to M&A activity. This could be upfront deal costs, this could be deal-related expenses, and the higher SG &A load that some of the M&A transactions carry with them.  So that has been a meaningful pressure for us, let's say maybe in the range of a 100 -- around 100 basis points or so. And then the rest of the pressure that we have seen is kind of split evenly between three major areas, I would say. Area number one is our IT modernization. That's clear it's starting to stabilize and that has put pressure on it. We had investments into our HR and recruiting organization in order to scale our hiring activity. And thirdly, our investments into our sales force and marketing capabilities. Those would be roughly in even , I think it's a fair amount to say, and some of those are now starting to , that's kind of what we are starting to anticipate and plateau. We do not want to reduce those expenses obviously because they are important to us; but we have found, I think levels that are allowing us to have a more moderated SG&A development going forward.  You will see more detail around that, obviously in our November meeting. But the third quarter is a little bit of an indication on what's happening here basically. Because we had still growth in these strategic investment areas, but we have started to curtail that growth in more traditional SG&A areas to offset that. And you can see that the  has started to bend a little bit, more work to be done. But it really developed as I would have expected in the third quarter. Listen, I think we've got a great senior leadership team these days. Most of the senior changes are , as I would view as to be very much in business as usual these days, retirements, internal promotions, some performance orientation, but this is kind of classic Fortune 200 Company land at this stage. I got to say, I'm delighted with the Leadership team we have around us these days.  We're getting back into a growth trajectory after a few years where our backlog and our pipeline haven't been -- on bookings hasn't been as strong as it needed to be. And I think you've seen united leadership team here orienting the Company towards a evolve business model, both geographically as well as the offerings that we ultimately solutions and deliver.  So that's not a concern to mind anymore. And of course, we'll always be press article at the individuals with a Company with 320,000 employees. Please don't get distracted by that on not. And with regards to digital, of course, it all depends on the portion of the portfolio you would look at, our digital growth with 18% within our portfolio.  If I look at our digital engineering business, our growth rate is equivalent to the pure plays that are announcing their results. If I look at our IoT business, the digital growth is as fast as the pure plays out there, same for our cloud business or digital experience business. So as I said, we tried to be extremely disciplined in the definition of digital, and in many ways we penalized ourselves.  But as a broader Company within the categories we look at, and I'll talk a little bit of this in the November 18th Investor Summit, we have some gems in our portfolio that are growing at significant rates, and ultimately that will continue to drive the growth rate of the Company forward.  A little bit that the mix shift this last few quarters, that has been hanging around in the mid-40s is somewhat reflective of numerator -denominator, where the non-digital business has actually had some better growth than anticipated. Well, I just think, again, it goes back to the definitions that companies have for digital. We've been quite intentional on being restrictive on what is digital, including our digital businesses, our TriZetto platform business, which is growing at a very healthy double-digit pace these days, significantly up from prior years. But it's not growing at the rate of maybe a digital engineering Company pure-play because it's not at all the same business or business models.  So it's important to recognize that everybody's definition of digital and what is within that differs. I would say I'm very pleased with our momentum in digital, we can always do better. We strive to do better. But our exposure to Digital exposes us to higher growth categories as a corporation, ultimately, higher margin categories as a corporation. It puts us up against a different set of competitors where we have pricing dynamics that will be favorable for Cognizant's pricing.  And ultimately most importantly for me, it makes us much more relevant to clients because we are becoming much more intimate with them as we become part of their transformation journey.  And as I go around and speak to clients around the world when we articulate our strategy and what we're doing, and start sharing some of the references we have,  clients are very open to proceeding with the next meeting to better understand what we have, today have optionality versus some of the incumbent. So I feel ultimately that we're in the right spaces. We will continue to double down, of course, there are certain industry where digital is a higher portion of our mix than others.  And there are certain geographies where I want to accelerate our digital capabilities, not just back to Rod's question earlier, the international markets where our digital mix is lower than it needs to be, because historically we spent a lot more of our focus on structured deals in those geographies, but also the delivery capabilities both near shore and onshore to fulfill any demand that we create in our commercial teams internationally, we need to further extend our capabilities there.

            "content": "Thank you, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Our Q3 revenue was $4.7 billion representing growth of approximately 12% or 11% at constant -currency. Revenue growth was led by digital, which grew 18% and represented 44% of total revenue for the quarter. As Brian mentioned earlier, our digital business operations practice area is also growing strongly.  Year-over-year growth includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial services revenue increased approximately 4% in line with our expectations. We continue to make steady progress as we reposition this business and have seen recent improvement in bookings and pipeline. We continue to expect modest growth for this segment for the full year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 10%, again, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and demand for our integrated software solutions remains strong.  We also remain very pleased with our life sciences business, which grew double-digits organically year-over-year. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 18% driven by the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit grow in manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utilities.  Retail and consumer goods, and travel and hospitality also grew double-digits year-over-year, with the both sectors experiencing  demand for digital services as they recovery from the impact of the pandemic in 2020. Segment growth also included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue.  Communications, Media, and Technology revenue grew 19%, of which approximately 500 basis points of growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. Organic growth was led by our Technology business, where our work with digital native clients has continued to drive growth in our core portfolio.  From a geographic perspective, North America grew approximately 10% year-over-year, driven by demand from healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, and technology. Growth in North America also included the benefit of recently completed acquisitions across segments.  Revenue outside of North America grew approximately 16% year-over-year in constant-currency, led by growth in the U.K. We also experience strong growth in Germany and Australia driven impact. Recently completed acquisitions of ESG, mobility and Serbian, respectively. Now, moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP operating margin was 15.4%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8%. Adjusted operating margin excludes the impact from the legal settlement, which if approved by the court, we'll resolve the previously disclosed 2016 securities class action lawsuit. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin declined approximately 10 basis points. Continued elevated attrition resulted in higher subcontractor recruiting, and other delivery costs.  Additionally, our recently completed acquisitions negatively impacted our margin, and we continue to invest in SG&A to drive and support organic revenue growth and modernize our core IT and securities infrastructure. These headwinds were partially offset by savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and 2021.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 25.6% and our adjusted tax rate was 26% towards the high end of our full-year guidance. Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.03 and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.06. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion.  Free cash flow of -- in Q3 was $897 million, representing approximately 165% of net income and in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $1.5 billion represents over 90% of net income. DSO of 72 days increased by one day sequentially, and is flat with the prior year period.  Management remains keenly focused on this metric as it is a key lever for free cash flow conversion in the future. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $100 million under our share repurchase program and returned $127 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in line with our previously disclosed capital allocation framework.  During the quarter, we also spend cash of $57 million on acquisitions, bringing the year-to-date spend on acquisitions to over $700 million. Turning to guidance, for Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.79 billion representing year-over-year growth of 13.5% to 14.5%, or 13.3% to 14.3% in constant currency.  Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 20 basis points impact, and inorganic contribution of approximately 310 basis points. As a reminder, Q4 2020 revenue was negatively impacted by the $107 million charge related to our proposed financial services contract exit, which is expected to benefit Q4, 2021 year-over-year growth, compared by approximately 250 basis points.  At the midpoint of our Q4 revenue outlook, we expect full-year revenue of $18.5 billion, representing 11.1% growth or 9.8% growth in constant currency. With that, we're guiding towards the high-end of our prior full-year guidance. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 130 basis points impact, and includes 330 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue.  Our guidance also assumes continued momentum across healthcare, CMT, and products and resources, and a modest growth in financial services for the full year. Moving on to margins. Our full-year adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged at approximately 15.4%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas, including recruiting and subcontractor costs, in addition to higher wages for lateral hires.  We also continue to invest significantly in our people through increased compensation, rolling quarterly promotions for billable associates and training. As a reminder, our annual merit increase for the majority of our associates is effective October 1. This will impact our Q4 margin and implies a sequential decline in adjusted operating margin from Q3.  To partially offset these headwinds, we continue to moderate the pace of non-strategic SG & A spends. This leads to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance, which is $4.2 to $4.6 compared to the $4 to $4.06 previously. Our full-year outlook assumes interest income of approximately 30 million compared to $25 million to $30 million previously.  Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 5 million, 28 million, and a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Both share count and tax rate are unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Maybe I'll start with the gross margin in the third quarter, which was relatively consistent to prior year. And obviously, a lot of in and out and clearly, we observed the impact of increased compensation onto the thing. But we had also positive effects like, for example, a modest shift in our digital revenues is helping us, overall acceleration of revenue growth has been a factor of helping our gross margin.  And a lot of ins and outs, and compare year-over-year because of the COVID situation. So you should expect, in the fourth quarter, pressure on our gross margins because we're implementing our compensation increase for the vast majority of our associates of having implemented October 1st.  So you do see some pressure on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. And clearly, we're working on all elements of curtailing that. But I think you will see net pressure. Pricing, I wanted to do two comments before I pass it back to Brian.  You know, of course, that the pricing takes some time to implement since clients have longer-term contracts, but when we -- when I will observe in particular, our digital business, I think I can say that our clients start to really see the value that Cognizant is delivering and understand the value that we can bring too.  So we're pleasantly satisfied, we are really happy with the situation that our core thesis about our strategy to shift to digital driving higher gross margin, is holding in helping us over the medium-term on the gross margin side. Back to you, Brian. That's an unexpected question. Actually the -- Lisa, obviously, No, I actually I do appreciate, I do appreciate the question. The translation of our 4 strategic priorities into operational measures and controlled processes is obviously a big endeavor for a multinational organization like Cognizant, and the finance organization was really laser-focused in supporting those four strategic priorities that Brian has been talking about.  I'll give you example from when you scale and expand your sales force and distribution capabilities, more effective measures on the effectiveness and results of that sales force are required, and I think you have seen this with improving disclosure and our bookings club. So you just see the surface of the effort behind that to drive -- improve transparency not only for us, but also for the street.  Similar initiatives have been underway for supporting our pricing and analytics capability relative to driving relevance to clients and ensuring that we deliver value to our clients, etc. Throughout the fourth, I wanted  trough all -- explain through all four initiatives, so what we're doing.  But that has been really the primary focus of the work and I have to say, I'm pleased because in the outcome, you have kind of experienced Cognizant as an organization that has made good in the last couple of quarters on our promises.  And that's how I measure ourselves really in the end, can we fulfill the financial commitments that we make to our shareholders And in terms of fulfilling our expectations, that has worked out with a lot of work pretty well, I think, particularly in the last half year where we have faced that really -- that changed industry with high attrition rates.  I remain personally excited about that opportunity. It's a Company that is changing, that is winning in the marketplace and you can feel that the energy is visibly accelerating over time. And that's part to -- it's fun to be part of that team. Yeah. Lisa, look. Some of the hyperscalers are obviously omnipresent, extremely powerful, and the platform scales into various different technologies. Cloud migration immediately gets you into data modernization, AI, machine learning, IoT, etc.  But then beyond that, we have some of the traditional partners we've had for years, some of which were stronger than others, the Oracle, DSA P, ISVs of the world, but we've certainly been a huge focus as well on what I would call next-generation leaders, companies like ServiceNow, companies like Salesforce, Workday. As a reminder, in the last year-and-a-half, we acquired collaborative solutions to scale a Workday practice.  We've also done 3 acquisitions in Salesforce. We have meaningfully changed our position with Salesforce. I was in a recent  with the Salesforce leadership team and they were singing our phrases in terms of how our position in Salesforce has exponentially grown. And then we will continue to do acquisitions in those areas as well that are aligned to our higher-growth categories.  Voltus set up 3 business groups behind the hyperscalers, though it's not lip service, it is true organization, we take it very seriously. I actually see the hyperscalers now focusing more and more towards industry alignment, and Cognizant, since it's our strength, particularly in healthcare and financial services, is naturally of interest to those.  Now, there are individual cases where you have industry-specific plays. It could be Pega Guidewire, Temenos, Duck Creek, etc. Naturally, they are relevant to individual industries within Cognizant, but on a more horizontal nature, is to companies I've referenced. And then of course in our operations business, which I'm very proud of, we've done a fantastic job over the last two years as we exited content moderation.  And frankly got the business back to meet the high-teams growth. And they have very strong partnerships across some of the high PA players in particular. Automation anywhere  in present etc. Bryan, there are multiple elements at play there. One of the bigger ones from a weighted impact is actually our business operation -- digital business operations business, which has been growing into strong teams within that we have elements that we classify as digital and are in our digital mix and there are elements that we don't classify digital. We have tended to be quite disciplined. We changed the definition of digital over two years ago at this stage and we've maintained that ever since. But there are other areas including a non-digital element of our AI and analytics portfolio. Again, we're being disciplined. They're elements that we view as digital, and elements that we view as more traditional business intelligence, etc. And then on top of that, we have elements within some of our enterprise applications business, and CIS business that have grown as well. Our goal, to be very honest, in a multiyear basis, is to mitigate the risk of declines in the non-digital business and hopefully maintain some growth in the non-digital business.  If we manage to do that, which requires us to be very disciplined from a pricing, from a renewal point-of-view; that will frankly complement what we expect to be very strong growth in digital, and therefore its goodness for the entire corporation. But at this moment in time, that is something that I think you've seen in competitive earnings as well. If you extrapolate the digital growth they have versus the total Company growth, particularly for those who suggest have a very large portion of their revenue that is digital, you will be able to truly extrapolate that they are seeing declines in their legacy businesses. Look, I think Brian explained it earlier in the call and we iterate it. We keenly focus on accelerating our growth rate. So we see momentum organically as we see -- we want to continue with our capital allocation program as we have announced it. So the acceleration of revenue growth is front and center in our view. We have ample of opportunity. And as such, we have made decisions to; of course, support the opportunities that we promised to our clients with staffing.  So HR will be funded as needed and we're actually very proud about the amount of scaling that we achieved and the amount of change in policy of accelerating the hiring of fresher's, optimizing our permit, scaling training programs; at our size it's a really important and complicated effort that that team executed well, and I will of course, or the Company will provide the funding for that as it's part of our growth engine.  But there are other elements that need themselves more natural to scale in certain IT components, certain marketing components, certain finance and classic support functions in the SG&A to  themselves for scaling. And we're going to continue to fund obviously, our sales force in the distribution area, I'm actually pretty pleased we have a good combination of growth and resources, but also of improvement in productivity in those sales forces.  And we have been busy at work to optimize our go-to market strategies, and I think we have more opportunities in that space, but also we will be funding organic growth appropriately to capture those opportunities. So I'm not too religious here relative to what the exact percentage growth of SG&A is, but you get the philosophy enough in my answer. Yeah. I'd be excited about talking about the next year in the next quarter and -- but -- and I'm not expecting any meaningful increase in my travel expense for this quarter, but to be a little bit more forthcoming. Obviously, the decisions of the return to work are going to be affected by really a myriad of factors: our client's need, our associate's preferences, the health situation by country, and it is really dynamic.  So we're evaluating this basically on a monthly basis and at the current point, we are still, as all competitors are, largely in a virtual environment which has worked actually pretty well for us. So we are planning to think about that as a strategic opportunity that meets the needs of all those stakeholders going forward.  And I have to say that is an -- it's a work in progress, that we really evaluating and there will be a gradual decision to the new business model that will be different than the historic business model. Maybe I add numbers for illustration that could be helpful. As you know, of course, our digital revenue is exceeding our overall Company growth and we are gaining share in digital revenues. But for me, a good example of the value of strategic focuses.  Also, our focus on the four digital battlegrounds that we have really identified; and those are the data monetization, the Cloud business, our IoT and digital engineering businesses, and those priority -- prioritized areas within digital actually also meaningfully outgrowing our overall digital revenue growth.  So I think for a Company to establish that focus and then executing in those focus areas in a thoughtful way is a good sign, and as ample opportunities to expand those things for the long run, but at least we're seeing in our numbers really, the results of exactly what we wanted that strategy to be. Look, it's -- I would say if I think about where it is voluntary attrition is highest, the mid-junior levels of the permit primarily in India, it's not just in one location in India, it's broad-based, but also against certain skills, whether it's cloud. Here we're talking Hyperscalers are leading SaaS players like Salesforce, digital engineering, full-stack engineers, job at Dot Netangular or just across data, AI and ML technologies. We're seeing significant attrition in those areas. And it's just a hot labor market. It is extremely consistent, I think in the country you've seen from our peers in the industry. And as I said earlier, we're working very hard to mitigate that. We do expect attrition to fall, sequentially on a year-over-year basis from where it is in Q3, based on the net resignations we've seen, and based on what we're seeing following the efforts we've had around hearts and minds on compensation.  But at this moment in time, we're still anticipating elevated attrition in the coming years, and to the question that we received earlier, we're funding in our P&L, what it takes to mitigate that. Those compensation measures as well as our recruitment team have been doing an incredible job for us and frankly, we expect to meaningfully scale our headcount in the coming year."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you.  I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.6 billion represented growth of 15% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. I'm grateful to our teams across the world for their unflagging dedication to consistently meeting our promises to clients. Thanks to the professionalism of all our associates with no major disruption to client service delivery from the second wave of the pandemic in India. We continue to execute against our previously announced Operation C3, which includes our vaccination drive across the 11 cities where Cognizant has operations in India. To date, we've administered or re-endorsed over 160,000 vaccines to associates or their families and dependents. I'm pleased with the strength of key commercial metrics. Bookings growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2 on a trailing 12-month basis. Qualified pipeline is significantly up, and our win rates are also up year-to-date, positioning us well for continued bookings momentum. Digital revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to industry segments. We posted strong double-digit year-over-year constant currency growth in Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Healthcare. We've achieved a double-digit CAGR over the past 4 years in Communications, Media and Technology and remain optimistic on our growth prospects. This industry is now home to some of our largest clients. Within Products and Resources we continue to post excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Meanwhile, both retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality posted their 4th successive quarter of sequential revenue increases and are now close to prepandemic revenue levels.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency. Revenue was $125 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for digital, which grew 20% and represented 44% of total revenues. Year-over-year revenue growth also includes approximately  of growth from our recent acquisitions and benefited from an easier compare to Q2 2020, where our revenues were impacted in the early months of the pandemic and by the ransomware attack in April 2020. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress as we reposition this business and observed a strong improvement in the pipeline. We still expect the paced recovery through the remainder of the year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 13%. Again, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and we continue to see strong demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. As Brian mentioned, we remain very pleased with the growth in our life sciences business. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Segment growth included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. As Brian mentioned, we also experienced growth in retail consumer goods and travel and hospitality, driven in part by the lapping of the prepandemic conveyors. There are early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but we continue to monitor closely. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 18%, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a negative 190 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions to our content services business. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting the savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and the impact from the pandemic and ransomware attack in Q2 2020. This year-over-year benefit was offset in part by SG&A investments, including those intended to drive and support organic revenue growth as well as the negative impact on margin on our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our IT core and security infrastructure. In addition, we anticipate continued cost pressure from our elevated attrition, which includes higher recruiting costs, lateral higher wages and subcontractor costs. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% and our adjusted tax rate was 25.4%, in line with our expectations. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in Q2 was $466 million. This included a payment from the settlement with 2 of the 3 customers that were part of the proposed customer engagement exit we announced in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Excluding this onetime payment, free cash flow would have been approximately 100% of net income. The payments made this quarter were in line with our prior expectations and resulted in no impact to our earnings in Q2. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome of the settlement, which includes a continued commercial relationship with both customers. Negotiations with the third client are ongoing and constructive. DSO of 71 days increased by 1 day sequentially and has improved from 77 days in the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $296 million at a weighted average price of approximately $74 per share. At the end of June, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $350 million on acquisitions and $127 million for our regular quarterly dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.74 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.6% to 11.6% or 10% to 11% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 60 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 320 basis points. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $18.4 billion to $18.5 billion, representing 10.2% to 11.2% growth or 9% to 10% in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of 7% to 9% growth as reported or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 120 basis points impact and includes approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our outlook assumes continued momentum across Healthcare, CMT and Products and Resources, while we continue to expect a paced recovery in Financial Services over the next couple of quarters. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.4%, the midpoint of our prior guidance of 15.2% to 15.7%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas. We are also continuing to fund investments in our people, including compensation, quarterly promotions, retention and training. We expect these costs will weigh on our results for the next several quarters as management remains keenly focused on addressing our high attrition levels through a comprehensive set of initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A growth for the remainder of the year, driven in part by the impact from our M&A activity. However, we are slowing the pace of growth in some areas not directly related to our strategic initiatives to mitigate some of this cost pressure. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance which is $4 to $4.06 compared to $3.90 to $4.02 previously. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million to $30 million compared to $20 million to $30 million previously. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million compared to 530 million previously and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before opening the call for questions, I wanted to let you know that we are planning to hold an investor briefing in the fall during which Brian and I will provide a review of our strategy and an update on our progress over the last 2 years. We will also provide our multiyear financial framework. Please keep an eye out and save the date in the coming weeks. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: A follow-up question, as I'm sure you'll get 20 of them related to the attrition and headcount dynamics. One, maybe, Jan, can you just elaborate on what gives you confidence in your ability to expand margins in the second half of the year while you're still sort of battling through this attrition environment? Like -- so for example, are you -- given the high demand environment, are you able to take price, et cetera? Just a little bit more color there. And then I'll just ask my second one kind of related is just around employee health. I'm just wondering like how employee satisfaction is faring at Cognizant? I know that's something that you watch pretty closely. So what's your confidence level in being able to bring attrition down over the next couple of quarters?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you're rightly concluded that for the second half, we are expecting really, on average, margin development around 15.6% to meet our midpoint of our guidance. And as you're also aware, we have a little bit of a quarterly dynamic towards the year-end. So margins in the third quarter, we're thinking, are going to be slightly higher than towards the fourth quarter due to typical end-of-season dynamics, including the merit increase when we administer and implement the merit thing. So that's kind of all the general margin dynamic. What we have seen, I want to point out a few other elements of the margin dynamic. We have seen, in this quarter, a fairly healthy margin dynamic on the gross margin side, and we reported a shift in our digital revenue mix, which comes actually with higher gross margin than our traditional business, which is part of the strategic rationale of why we are, of course, engaging in the transformation of the business. And that margin effect was accelerated actually, we shifted share, but we also improved that relative margin in our second quarter. So we anticipate to continue to have some benefit from that mix shift also in the second half. And then, of course, we see pressure from the compensation measures coming into our P&L. And we're offsetting that by controlling the growth of certain SG&A components that have been growing kind of likely, I would say, to and bring that more to a controlled or flattish outcome towards the end of the year. And so it's a number of factors that we have to keenly execute in order to keep, of course, the overall structure of our P&L in place, but that's the principal dynamic that we are following. And I hand over the employee engagement question to Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thanks, Jan. Hi, Lisa. Look, it's very much top of mind. As you can imagine, voluntary attrition in the quarter was 29%. But on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more how the industry tends to look at it, it was 18%. And we've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen or our team has seen over the last 10-plus years. So we're all dealing with it. As it happens in the last month, we had the results of our annual engagement survey. We're actually very pleased with our results. They're at or above, in many cases, industry benchmarks. I'm really pleased to see the delivery organization, engagement scores are actually above the company average, and they're very much as a total company in the same range as where we've been from 2016 and beyond. Last year, we actually had a particularly strong year, as many companies did, because of the pandemic when people were pleased when they had secure jobs or whatnot. So from one perspective, I feel very, very good about it. But in the same vein, of course, I don't feel very good about the attrition. And so that's top of mind, and it's got a lot of management focus. I'm pleased that we executed well in the quarter. We exceeded our revenue guidance despite elevated attrition, but my great hope is, over time, we can reduce attrition and yet continue to hire at the pace we have been hiring at, which is something we're very pleased with. The throughput of our recruitment team has been terrific. So what are we doing to reduce attrition and to continue to drive employee engagement is the next obvious question. Well, look, annual merit-based increases have been announced here in the last few weeks. They're effective October 1. That's on top of a whole host of ad hoc measures we played through in the course of the last year: out-of-cycle increases, promotion, retention dollars. We've announced a shift in the last few months to quarterly promotion cycles for billable resources. We've really fast-tracked job rotations and reskilling initiatives across the company, then a host of things with Cognizant Academy, which is our training capability, as well as higher education programs for select employees as well. And we've put an enormous effort behind our employee value proposition, celebrating delivery success, big wins, et cetera. So more work to be done, but I'm confident we're doing the right things. And as I said, while I'm pleased we executed through at this quarter, the reality is 15% revenue growth this quarter also gives the organization a little bit of energy that, look, growth is coming back and with growth comes good things in terms of career path opportunities, rotations and promotions and whatnot. So I'm sure today's top line story will help a lot of employees feel better, and we'll keep doing all the other things we're doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Good quarter, guys. I wanted to follow up also on attrition. Could you talk a little bit more about what you expect for 3Q, 4Q attrition? And what's been the client feedback in the face of the situation?\nBrian Humphries: So look, from my perspective, the first thing I would think about our associates and our clients, and you can't be client-centric unless you're associate-centric. And so as we start thinking about this, of course, it gets into how we engage our clients and how we think about the demand signal that will help us facilitate the right resources at the right time. Communication is important in a time like this, setting appropriate expectations regarding resource availability time lines. Entity prioritization, Ashwin, as you can imagine, getting the right resources on our most strategic accounts is very much top of mind and part of our execution rigor we do now on a day in, day out basis. Regrettably, we just -- despite growing 15% in the quarter, we're yet unable to meet the full expectations of our own potential and what is out there in the market. So we're working through that as best we can and doing our best, as I said, to minimize attrition, whilst at the same time to maximize employee engagement and to maximize onboarding. As I said in my remarks, we'll bring on about 100,000 lateral hires this year alone. We'll train about 100,000 people, and we'll onboard about 30,000 freshers and we'll make offers to 45,000 freshers. Regardless of our attrition rate, we will still go through with those numbers because there is enough market demand for us to get after that opportunity. And that's what we're quite excited about. I think the portfolio is more compelling than ever before, and we've made huge progress in the last year to get after that market opportunity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But it's a hot market, and I think you've heard that through the earnings cycle. So we're all dealing with the same problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: I'll just ask 2 upfront here. So as it relates to bookings and the growing commercial momentum you called out, can you comment on how well distributed the bookings contribution has been across the sales force? So how much of your sales force would you say is optimized and converting versus those that are still building pipeline and will convert over the balance of this year into next? And then just to clarify on attrition, have you continued to see the trend of declining resignations month-to-month?\nBrian Humphries: Well, I'll deal with that first. Look, we look at net resignations. It went through -- actually, at the end of last quarter, we thought we'd hit an apex and then it went up modestly, but it's -- we're expecting, and it's inherent in our guidance, elevated attritions to remain in the coming quarter, and we'll see what happens thereafter. It's a very -- as you can imagine, a hot market out there, and so it's very difficult to call. I think we're doing the right things to mitigate that. But rest assured, these levels of attrition and slightly beyond our inner guidance. With regards to bookings, look, I feel really good about our bookings, to be very honest. It's important to look at bookings not just on a weekly or a quarterly basis, but really on a trailing 12-month basis. And now we have rounded that 1-year period, so we have a good book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months of 1.2x, which I think is very, very healthy. We look at it in terms of geographic. We look at it in terms of business mix. We look at it in terms of new and expansion versus renewals. And it's pretty solid across the board. And the pipeline is solid across the board as well. So I feel good about the market opportunity. Candidly, I don't think demand is the problem for this industry. I think it's a great time to be in services. It's more of a supply constraint at this moment in time. With regard to the sales, our commercial teams we brought on board. Look, they're ramping. I don't think we have full productivity. At this stage, we've got a lot of exercises underway to make sure we get true gearing ratios. But in the same vein, I feel as though we've got a client-facing team now that is better able to walk the corridors if and when we get back from COVID, virtually for now, and to cross-sell the entire portfolio. And if you think about our installed base, it's a huge asset for us and the opportunity is real. About 4 out of 10, or 40%, of our accounts, we only sell 1 of our practices into those, and we have 10-plus practices. So think about cross-sell as a huge opportunity for us. And of course, the M&A that we have conducted in the last 2 years, which is 100% aligned to our digital strategy, enables that cross-sell more than ever before. And indeed, cross-sell is core to the business case of those acquisitions. So we're pretty excited about what we can do there, both in terms of our installed base, which, of course, is a big priority for us. But we also have opportunity through this extended portfolio to get after new logos. And the Qualcomm example I cited in my script is a good example of that, where we're leading with digital. And accordingly, we'll try and cross-sell the non-digital business as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research.\nRod Bourgeois: Hey, Brian, so when you consider your pipeline and your inorganic growth plan going forward, are you in a position to further substantially increase your digital mix over the next year? I'd love any color to help dimension the remaining mix shift potential over the next year or so, that would be really helpful.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Hey, Rob. So as you know very well, one of our biggest priorities when I joined the company was to accelerate our digital mix. It was 28% or less than 30%, certainly at the end of 2018 for the year. And it's been very much part and parcel of what we're setting out to achieve. It's 44% of our mix today. Candidly, a numerator denominator comes into play. We actually had very good success this quarter, driving growth as well in our non-digital business, which has declined in 2019 and 2020. So candidly, that has slowed the digital mix ramping further, the share growth of non-digital this quarter. But overall, the digital business will continue to grow. I'd like to think as we get to the latter part of this year, we'll be up closer to 50%, and it will start becoming a bigger portion of our overall business over time. That's important for us because: a, it helps us be exposed to higher growth categories; but b, it increases our intimacy with the broader C-suite in our installed base of accounts, and that enables us to sell beyond the CTO organization into the CMO into the line of service leader, et cetera. Of the accounts that we have added in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, the vast majority of the bookings exactly in what we would term digital. So Rod, that mix shift to digital will continue, and I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice ramp there. That is not just good for revenue or client intimacy, it's actually also very good for our margin rate as a company as well. So we feel as though we're doing the right things. Our M&A strategy is 100% behind this, and it puts us in a position to actually get after our installed base to cross-sell and upsell and actually get new logos and really become a challenger in the digital arena.\nJan Siegmund: Rod, if I add one comment on the dynamic of the digital organic revenue growth, we very carefully monitor the organic growth that our M&A is generating within itself, but also, of course, as a cross-sell into our client base, and we have seen a very robust organic growth from that portfolio that is kind of, in most cases, meeting our business case assumptions. So we're very pleased that actually, the shift is not only of M&A, it's not only adding the incremental acquired revenues to the portfolio, but that portfolio also is accelerating and growing faster than the average in its growth trajectory.\nBrian Humphries: And Rod, I meant to -- you explicitly asked around the pipeline. Look, the digital pipeline has grown at multiples of the non-digital pipeline. And actually, our win rates in digital are higher than our win rates in non-digital. So there's a lot of good leading indicators.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. And Jan, you kind of read my mind. My follow-up was related to the acquisitions. And looking for an update on your progress in being able to cross-sell the newly acquired offerings into your existing accounts, that's a muscle that tends to take time to develop. So maybe just give us some thinking on where you are in that journey? Are you well into that journey? Or is there still some juice left on the cross-selling into existing accounts with these newly acquired capabilities that you have?\nJan Siegmund: I would say we're still in the early and mid-parts of our journey. We made really good outcomes happen for acquisitions that have examples where we haven't even closed the acquisition. We started to think about cross-selling the product already prior to the close, so there's plenty of excitement in our sales force to bring these solutions to our clients. And as we now focus to fully integrate this acquired portfolio of digital capabilities into the fold of Cognizant, many other benefits of pipeline management will become easier, the learning for the acquired companies will grow, so I'm optimistic that we will continue to reap really good benefits out of the M&A regarding to the organic growth that they are generating, which is what I'm really keenly focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nBradley Clark: This is Brad Clark on for Keith. I would like to ask if there was any way to quantify either the impact or size of the planned wage increases for employees. And then secondly, given ongoing employee and market pressure on margin throughout the remainder of the year, how do you view future M&A strategy compared to the past 12 to 18 months? Is the pace of M&A sustainable? What are your views on that going forward?\nBrian Humphries: Jan?\nJan Siegmund: Yes, thank you for your question. We don't disclose really the elements of our compensation moves externally, so I can't help you with that. It is clearly reflecting the market dynamics. We are orienting our compensation, obviously, on market data and reflect -- our compensation moves really reflect an assessment about keeping Cognizant a competitive employer and recruiter in the marketplace. And we are very pleased actually with that. The ability to attract associates into the Cognizant family is great. We've been ranked in a variety of publications as really employer of choice, and particularly, in the critical market of India for us. So it will feather through country-specific and market-oriented based on wage developments in those countries. On the M&A program, we just talked about, I think, at the end of last year, about a capital allocation framework for the company, which about -- dedicates 50% of our cash flow to M&A for a reminder, about 25% used to offset the dilution of our equity compensation and 25% for dividends. And we use this framework not to position, but as a really good framework for us to execute our strategy. So going forward, I'm anticipating to spend within the range of that capital allocation framework to support the execution of our strategy. We remain focused in that M&A program on our strategic objectives and focus on our digital battlegrounds. You have seen in some of the acquisitions in the beginning of this year, that we may have, and it's with few transactions, hard to describe the trend, but there is a keen focus on executing and using the strategy also to help the globalization of Cognizant. And so you have seen with Servian earlier in the year, an acquisition in the Australian marketplace. We acquired ESG Mobility in the fatherland, my home country, which I was very happy about, really a leading provider on the Internet of Things, IoT, with keen leadership positions in the automotive sector. So there is more geographic diversion still needed for us. And so we'll adapt as we make progress on the positioning of our practices and our industry groups to the needs of the strategy. And so this is a long answer for you, but yes, we anticipate to continue our acquisition-driven strategy execution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I'll mix it up and ask about TriZetto. I think I heard that your repositioning is driving better growth, double digits. I was a little surprised by that. I'm curious, can you elaborate on that? What are you doing differently? And could this kind of change be extended or apply it to other areas as well?\nBrian Humphries: So our product business in Healthcare, Tien-Tsin, is something that we inherited through the TriZetto acquisition at the end of 2014. To be very honest, I think we didn't execute the integration of that optimally. And in the last few years, we've really tried to get after that opportunity because I think it's a crown jewel that I felt we could do a better job on. And so starting with that, we got off to the road map that we had, tried to understand, solicit customer feedback to make sure we had something that in the eyes of clients was in line with their needs that the user interface and the code was appropriate and fit for purpose. And in the meantime, we had some competitors that had emerged that frankly, I didn't think had the right to beat us given our heritage in this space. Fortunately, now, we've had 3 quarters in a row of double-digit growth in the product business. And as I said, our growth in 2020 versus 2019 doubled, and we're on track to double growth rate year-over-year again and we're getting some fantastic logos. And this is a great business in itself. It's software-centric, higher margins. But of course, the stickiness of that enables us to pull through a rich services suite thereafter. So the team has done a fantastic job. I view it as highly strategic for us, and we're 100% committed to that business, and you'll see us scale in that over time.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, it's encouraging to hear. I'll ask quickly, if you don't mind, just on the supply side, just with more lateral hires. Can we just infer that's indicative of more digital work, so you need to go out there and grab some of the lateral hires? Or is it just purely out of necessity, given what you said about demand and the timing of university hiring or maybe more work needs to be done on the training side to meet the type of work that needs to be done? I'm just trying to understand what's structural versus cyclical there.\nBrian Humphries: If you think about the lateral hires, it's really with a view to doing 2 things. One is addressing the attrition that we have and also getting after the market potential that we see. And so you go back to where is attrition greatest, it's at the mid-junior levels of the pyramid, particularly in India. But it's also in hot skills. And if you think about hot skills, think about hyperscalers, think about leading SaaS players, think about digital engineering, full stack engineers or across data, AI and ML. And so you find yourself in a situation where you've got a demand-supply imbalance, and that's an area as well where we're also going after lateral skills and trying to get them in as quickly as we can, whilst also trying to train and promote our internal employees as well. So it's a race for talent in a red hot market. And I anticipate, given how bullish I am in the market, and my sense is we'll have a resilient services, the main feature for the foreseeable future, I anticipate elevated attrition across the industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Mike on for Jamie. So my first one, can you guys talk a little bit about your updated perspective on 5G? And this quarter with CMT growing so well, has 5G offered any tailwinds there?\nBrian Humphries: Look, from my perspective, 5G is still in its very early days, both in terms of asset -- handset proliferation and the use cases that probably, given the need for latency security and other considerations, will be more B2B or B2B2B rather than B2C. I don't think B2C is a huge inflection point for the telco industry, albeit many people will talk about it to justify CapEx outlays. With regards to our CMT industry vertical, it has not been a major driver of the business to date. We're very intrigued around autonomous driving. As Jan said, we acquired ESG Mobility in Germany. We've got a big emphasis on the automotive vertical and indeed on the CMT vertical, but 5G has not been a massive factor to date. I think IoT will be unlocked by the benefits of 5G and different cellular technologies, but it's premature at this stage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. I wanted to ask on pricing. I mean you touched a bit on that earlier. But how has pricing trended in the quarter, particularly given some of the pure commentary around pricing stability? And I guess what we're really trying to get at is are you able to pass on some of the wage costs? And how are clients responding to that?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. We have observed pricing trends by segment. And I implied in my comments that we have been expanding our gross margins on the digital business, and we have seen an ability to the tight labor market, allowing us to get good pricing for our services. We see also continued pricing pressure in the more traditional services that we have been talking about in past quarters, where clients are seeking additional cost benefit, and that pricing pressure in those more traditional type of services haven't changed at this point in time.\nJames Faucette: And just on digital quickly. We're big believers in your acquisition strategy, and I appreciate the early color around digital battlegrounds. But are there any digital battlegrounds where you're currently under-indexed relative to the demand that you're seeing that you could take a better advantage of?\nBrian Humphries: Hey, James, this is Brian, I'll address that. Look, the digital arena more holistically for us, it goes well beyond the 4 digital battlegrounds that I focused on when we joined, which were notably around cloud, around digital engineering, around applications and IoT and data and analytics, rather. The -- if you think about other areas that are not included in those so-called battlegrounds, things like digital experience continue to grow rapidly for us, and I'm very optimistic that, that becomes a core part of the sale, the whole user experience as you think about digital workflows. So it's broad-based. Digital engineering is something we prioritize. It's growing rapidly. As I said, it's one of our biggest growth potential units in the years ahead. Something that has scaled meaningfully in the last 2 years, and we're now one of the largest digital engineering companies in the world. We've complemented our capabilities with the acquisition of Softvision in 2018, and then in more recent years, Magenic and Tin Roof. I just feel very good about our potential there, but more broadly, there's just a lot of demand in this arena, and I just feel good about our potential because we're scaling, it's still a smaller portion of our mix. The more we scale, the higher company average CAGR. And as Jan has implied, it's good for our margin rate as well. So we're full speed ahead after the digital opportunity.\nTyler Scott: All right. I think with that, we'll wrap it up. Thank you, everybody, for joining, and look forward to speaking with everyone next quarter.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. Against a challenging labor market backdrop and the recent humanitarian crisis in India, we executed well in the second quarter, allowing us to deliver significant upside to our revenue guidance. Second quarter revenue of $4.6 billion represented growth of 15% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. I'm grateful to our teams across the world for their unflagging dedication to consistently meeting our promises to clients. Thanks to the professionalism of all our associates with no major disruption to client service delivery from the second wave of the pandemic in India. We continue to execute against our previously announced Operation C3, which includes our vaccination drive across the 11 cities where Cognizant has operations in India. To date, we've administered or re-endorsed over 160,000 vaccines to associates or their families and dependents. I'm pleased with the strength of key commercial metrics. Bookings growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our book-to-bill ratio is now 1.2 on a trailing 12-month basis. Qualified pipeline is significantly up, and our win rates are also up year-to-date, positioning us well for continued bookings momentum. Digital revenue growth accelerated to 20% year-over-year in the quarter. Moving to industry segments. We posted strong double-digit year-over-year constant currency growth in Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Healthcare. We've achieved a double-digit CAGR over the past 4 years in Communications, Media and Technology and remain optimistic on our growth prospects. This industry is now home to some of our largest clients. Within Products and Resources we continue to post excellent growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Meanwhile, both retail and consumer goods and travel and hospitality posted their 4th successive quarter of sequential revenue increases and are now close to prepandemic revenue levels. Thanks, Jan. Hi, Lisa. Look, it's very much top of mind. As you can imagine, voluntary attrition in the quarter was 29%. But on a trailing 12-month basis, which is more how the industry tends to look at it, it was 18%. And we've seen primarily the attrition in the more junior levels of the organization or mid-levels in India, but it's also a global phenomenon. It's really one of the hottest markets we've seen or our team has seen over the last 10-plus years. So we're all dealing with it. As it happens in the last month, we had the results of our annual engagement survey. We're actually very pleased with our results. They're at or above, in many cases, industry benchmarks. I'm really pleased to see the delivery organization, engagement scores are actually above the company average, and they're very much as a total company in the same range as where we've been from 2016 and beyond. Last year, we actually had a particularly strong year, as many companies did, because of the pandemic when people were pleased when they had secure jobs or whatnot. So from one perspective, I feel very, very good about it. But in the same vein, of course, I don't feel very good about the attrition. And so that's top of mind, and it's got a lot of management focus. I'm pleased that we executed well in the quarter. We exceeded our revenue guidance despite elevated attrition, but my great hope is, over time, we can reduce attrition and yet continue to hire at the pace we have been hiring at, which is something we're very pleased with. The throughput of our recruitment team has been terrific. So what are we doing to reduce attrition and to continue to drive employee engagement is the next obvious question. Well, look, annual merit-based increases have been announced here in the last few weeks. They're effective October 1. That's on top of a whole host of ad hoc measures we played through in the course of the last year: out-of-cycle increases, promotion, retention dollars. We've announced a shift in the last few months to quarterly promotion cycles for billable resources. We've really fast-tracked job rotations and reskilling initiatives across the company, then a host of things with Cognizant Academy, which is our training capability, as well as higher education programs for select employees as well. And we've put an enormous effort behind our employee value proposition, celebrating delivery success, big wins, et cetera. So more work to be done, but I'm confident we're doing the right things. And as I said, while I'm pleased we executed through at this quarter, the reality is 15% revenue growth this quarter also gives the organization a little bit of energy that, look, growth is coming back and with growth comes good things in terms of career path opportunities, rotations and promotions and whatnot. So I'm sure today's top line story will help a lot of employees feel better, and we'll keep doing all the other things we're doing. So look, from my perspective, the first thing I would think about our associates and our clients, and you can't be client-centric unless you're associate-centric. And so as we start thinking about this, of course, it gets into how we engage our clients and how we think about the demand signal that will help us facilitate the right resources at the right time. Communication is important in a time like this, setting appropriate expectations regarding resource availability time lines. Entity prioritization, Ashwin, as you can imagine, getting the right resources on our most strategic accounts is very much top of mind and part of our execution rigor we do now on a day in, day out basis. Regrettably, we just -- despite growing 15% in the quarter, we're yet unable to meet the full expectations of our own potential and what is out there in the market. So we're working through that as best we can and doing our best, as I said, to minimize attrition, whilst at the same time to maximize employee engagement and to maximize onboarding. As I said in my remarks, we'll bring on about 100,000 lateral hires this year alone. We'll train about 100,000 people, and we'll onboard about 30,000 freshers and we'll make offers to 45,000 freshers. Regardless of our attrition rate, we will still go through with those numbers because there is enough market demand for us to get after that opportunity. And that's what we're quite excited about. I think the portfolio is more compelling than ever before, and we've made huge progress in the last year to get after that market opportunity. So we're feeling pretty good about that. But it's a hot market, and I think you've heard that through the earnings cycle. So we're all dealing with the same problem. Well, I'll deal with that first. Look, we look at net resignations. It went through -- actually, at the end of last quarter, we thought we'd hit an apex and then it went up modestly, but it's -- we're expecting, and it's inherent in our guidance, elevated attritions to remain in the coming quarter, and we'll see what happens thereafter. It's a very -- as you can imagine, a hot market out there, and so it's very difficult to call. I think we're doing the right things to mitigate that. But rest assured, these levels of attrition and slightly beyond our inner guidance. With regards to bookings, look, I feel really good about our bookings, to be very honest. It's important to look at bookings not just on a weekly or a quarterly basis, but really on a trailing 12-month basis. And now we have rounded that 1-year period, so we have a good book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months of 1.2x, which I think is very, very healthy. We look at it in terms of geographic. We look at it in terms of business mix. We look at it in terms of new and expansion versus renewals. And it's pretty solid across the board. And the pipeline is solid across the board as well. So I feel good about the market opportunity. Candidly, I don't think demand is the problem for this industry. I think it's a great time to be in services. It's more of a supply constraint at this moment in time. With regard to the sales, our commercial teams we brought on board. Look, they're ramping. I don't think we have full productivity. At this stage, we've got a lot of exercises underway to make sure we get true gearing ratios. But in the same vein, I feel as though we've got a client-facing team now that is better able to walk the corridors if and when we get back from COVID, virtually for now, and to cross-sell the entire portfolio. And if you think about our installed base, it's a huge asset for us and the opportunity is real. About 4 out of 10, or 40%, of our accounts, we only sell 1 of our practices into those, and we have 10-plus practices. So think about cross-sell as a huge opportunity for us. And of course, the M&A that we have conducted in the last 2 years, which is 100% aligned to our digital strategy, enables that cross-sell more than ever before.

So candidly, that has slowed the digital mix ramping further, the share growth of non-digital this quarter. But overall, the digital business will continue to grow. I'd like to think as we get to the latter part of this year, we'll be up closer to 50%, and it will start becoming a bigger portion of our overall business over time. That's important for us because: a, it helps us be exposed to higher growth categories; but b, it increases our intimacy with the broader C-suite in our installed base of accounts, and that enables us to sell beyond the CTO organization into the CMO into the line of service leader, et cetera. Of the accounts that we have added in the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, the vast majority of the bookings exactly in what we would term digital. So Rod, that mix shift to digital will continue, and I'm pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see a nice ramp there. That is not just good for revenue or client intimacy, it's actually also very good for our margin rate as a company as well. So we feel as though we're doing the right things.

And Rod, I meant to -- you explicitly asked around the pipeline. Look, the digital pipeline has grown at multiples of the non-digital pipeline. And actually, our win rates in digital are higher than our win rates in non-digital. So there's a lot of good leading indicators. Jan? So our product business in Healthcare, Tien-Tsin, is something that we inherited through the TriZetto acquisition at the end of 2014. To be very honest, I think we didn't execute the integration of that optimally. And in the last few years, we've really tried to get after that opportunity because I think it's a crown jewel that I felt we could do a better job on.

So it's a race for talent in a red hot market. And I anticipate, given how bullish I am in the market, and my sense is we'll have a resilient services, the main feature for the foreseeable future, I anticipate elevated attrition across the industry. Look, from my perspective, 5G is still in its very early days, both in terms of asset -- handset proliferation and the use cases that probably, given the need for latency security and other considerations, will be more B2B or B2B2B rather than B2C. I don't think B2C is a huge inflection point for the telco industry, albeit many people will talk about it to justify CapEx outlays. With regards to our CMT industry vertical, it has not been a major driver of the business to date. We're very intrigued around autonomous driving. As Jan said, we acquired ESG Mobility in Germany. We've got a big emphasis on the automotive vertical and indeed on the CMT vertical, but 5G has not been a massive factor to date. I think IoT will be unlocked by the benefits of 5G and different cellular technologies, but it's premature at this stage. Hey, James, this is Brian, I'll address that. Look, the digital arena more holistically for us, it goes well beyond the 4 digital battlegrounds that I focused on when we joined, which were notably around cloud, around digital engineering, around applications and IoT and data and analytics, rather.

The more we scale, the higher company average CAGR. And as Jan has implied, it's good for our margin rate as well. So we're full speed ahead after the digital opportunity. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q2 revenue was $4.6 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% or 12% in constant currency. Revenue was $125 million above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued demand for digital, which grew 20% and represented 44% of total revenues. Year-over-year revenue growth also includes approximately  of growth from our recent acquisitions and benefited from an easier compare to Q2 2020, where our revenues were impacted in the early months of the pandemic and by the ransomware attack in April 2020. Moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%, in line with our expectations. We continue to make progress as we reposition this business and observed a strong improvement in the pipeline. We still expect the paced recovery through the remainder of the year. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 13%. Again, driven by strong performance in both our health care payer and life sciences businesses. Revenue growth within our Healthcare business was primarily organic, and we continue to see strong demand for our integrated payer software solutions and improving fundamentals in our provider business. As Brian mentioned, we remain very pleased with the growth in our life sciences business. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 18%, driven by the 5th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Segment growth included approximately 600 basis points from inorganic revenue. As Brian mentioned, we also experienced growth in retail consumer goods and travel and hospitality, driven in part by the lapping of the prepandemic conveyors. There are early signs of stabilization within these sectors most impacted by the pandemic, but we continue to monitor closely. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 18%, of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a negative 190 basis point impact from our exit of certain portions to our content services business. Overall, we are very pleased with the growth of our core portfolio. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margin were both 15.2%. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin improved approximately 110 basis points, primarily reflecting the savings from our cost initiatives in 2020 and the impact from the pandemic and ransomware attack in Q2 2020. This year-over-year benefit was offset in part by SG&A investments, including those intended to drive and support organic revenue growth as well as the negative impact on margin on our recently completed acquisitions and costs related to the modernization of our IT core and security infrastructure. In addition, we anticipate continued cost pressure from our elevated attrition, which includes higher recruiting costs, lateral higher wages and subcontractor costs. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.5% and our adjusted tax rate was 25.4%, in line with our expectations. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.97 and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. Free cash flow in Q2 was $466 million. This included a payment from the settlement with 2 of the 3 customers that were part of the proposed customer engagement exit we announced in our fourth quarter 2020 earnings. Excluding this onetime payment, free cash flow would have been approximately 100% of net income. The payments made this quarter were in line with our prior expectations and resulted in no impact to our earnings in Q2. Overall, we were pleased with the outcome of the settlement, which includes a continued commercial relationship with both customers. Negotiations with the third client are ongoing and constructive. DSO of 71 days increased by 1 day sequentially and has improved from 77 days in the prior year period. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $296 million at a weighted average price of approximately $74 per share. At the end of June, we had $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We also spent cash of approximately $350 million on acquisitions and $127 million for our regular quarterly dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.74 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 10.6% to 11.6% or 10% to 11% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a favorable 60 basis points impact and inorganic contribution of approximately 320 basis points. For the full year, we now expect revenue of $18.4 billion to $18.5 billion, representing 10.2% to 11.2% growth or 9% to 10% in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of 7% to 9% growth as reported or 5.5% to 7.5% in constant currency. Our outlook assumes currency will have a favorable 120 basis points impact and includes approximately 320 basis points contribution from inorganic revenue. Our outlook assumes continued momentum across Healthcare, CMT and Products and Resources, while we continue to expect a paced recovery in Financial Services over the next couple of quarters. Moving on to margins. We expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.4%, the midpoint of our prior guidance of 15.2% to 15.7%. As I mentioned earlier, elevated attrition is leading to increased costs in certain areas. We are also continuing to fund investments in our people, including compensation, quarterly promotions, retention and training. We expect these costs will weigh on our results for the next several quarters as management remains keenly focused on addressing our high attrition levels through a comprehensive set of initiatives. We continue to expect SG&A growth for the remainder of the year, driven in part by the impact from our M&A activity. However, we are slowing the pace of growth in some areas not directly related to our strategic initiatives to mitigate some of this cost pressure. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance which is $4 to $4.06 compared to $3.90 to $4.02 previously. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million to $30 million compared to $20 million to $30 million previously. Our outlook assumes average shares outstanding of approximately 528 million compared to 530 million previously and a tax rate of 25% to 26%, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow will represent approximately 100% of net income for the full year. We remain committed to our balanced capital deployment strategy and returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before opening the call for questions, I wanted to let you know that we are planning to hold an investor briefing in the fall during which Brian and I will provide a review of our strategy and an update on our progress over the last 2 years. We will also provide our multiyear financial framework. Please keep an eye out and save the date in the coming weeks. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. Thank you, Lisa, and somehow I anticipated questions around our margin guidance being of interest. It's a complex situation, Lisa, in that we have actually quite a few dynamics going on that impact the margin dynamic for the second half. And so you're rightly concluded that for the second half, we are expecting really, on average, margin development around 15.6% to meet our midpoint of our guidance. And as you're also aware, we have a little bit of a quarterly dynamic towards the year-end. So margins in the third quarter, we're thinking, are going to be slightly higher than towards the fourth quarter due to typical end-of-season dynamics, including the merit increase when we administer and implement the merit thing. So that's kind of all the general margin dynamic. What we have seen, I want to point out a few other elements of the margin dynamic. We have seen, in this quarter, a fairly healthy margin dynamic on the gross margin side, and we reported a shift in our digital revenue mix, which comes actually with higher gross margin than our traditional business, which is part of the strategic rationale of why we are, of course, engaging in the transformation of the business. And that margin effect was accelerated actually, we shifted share, but we also improved that relative margin in our second quarter. So we anticipate to continue to have some benefit from that mix shift also in the second half. And then, of course, we see pressure from the compensation measures coming into our P&L. And we're offsetting that by controlling the growth of certain SG&A components that have been growing kind of likely, I would say, to and bring that more to a controlled or flattish outcome towards the end of the year. And so it's a number of factors that we have to keenly execute in order to keep, of course, the overall structure of our P&L in place, but that's the principal dynamic that we are following. And I hand over the employee engagement question to Brian. Rod, if I add one comment on the dynamic of the digital organic revenue growth, we very carefully monitor the organic growth that our M&A is generating within itself, but also, of course, as a cross-sell into our client base, and we have seen a very robust organic growth from that portfolio that is kind of, in most cases, meeting our business case assumptions. So we're very pleased that actually, the shift is not only of M&A, it's not only adding the incremental acquired revenues to the portfolio, but that portfolio also is accelerating and growing faster than the average in its growth trajectory. I would say we're still in the early and mid-parts of our journey. We made really good outcomes happen for acquisitions that have examples where we haven't even closed the acquisition. We started to think about cross-selling the product already prior to the close, so there's plenty of excitement in our sales force to bring these solutions to our clients. And as we now focus to fully integrate this acquired portfolio of digital capabilities into the fold of Cognizant, many other benefits of pipeline management will become easier, the learning for the acquired companies will grow, so I'm optimistic that we will continue to reap really good benefits out of the M&A regarding to the organic growth that they are generating, which is what I'm really keenly focused on. Yes, thank you for your question. We don't disclose really the elements of our compensation moves externally, so I can't help you with that. It is clearly reflecting the market dynamics. We are orienting our compensation, obviously, on market data and reflect -- our compensation moves really reflect an assessment about keeping Cognizant a competitive employer and recruiter in the marketplace. And we are very pleased actually with that. The ability to attract associates into the Cognizant family is great. We've been ranked in a variety of publications as really employer of choice, and particularly, in the critical market of India for us. So it will feather through country-specific and market-oriented based on wage developments in those countries. On the M&A program, we just talked about, I think, at the end of last year, about a capital allocation framework for the company, which about -- dedicates 50% of our cash flow to M&A for a reminder, about 25% used to offset the dilution of our equity compensation and 25% for dividends. And we use this framework not to position, but as a really good framework for us to execute our strategy. So going forward, I'm anticipating to spend within the range of that capital allocation framework to support the execution of our strategy. We remain focused in that M&A program on our strategic objectives and focus on our digital battlegrounds. You have seen in some of the acquisitions in the beginning of this year, that we may have, and it's with few transactions, hard to describe the trend, but there is a keen focus on executing and using the strategy also to help the globalization of Cognizant. And so you have seen with Servian earlier in the year, an acquisition in the Australian marketplace. We acquired ESG Mobility in the fatherland, my home country, which I was very happy about, really a leading provider on the Internet of Things, IoT, with keen leadership positions in the automotive sector. So there is more geographic diversion still needed for us. And so we'll adapt as we make progress on the positioning of our practices and our industry groups to the needs of the strategy. And so this is a long answer for you, but yes, we anticipate to continue our acquisition-driven strategy execution. Yes. We have observed pricing trends by segment. And I implied in my comments that we have been expanding our gross margins on the digital business, and we have seen an ability to the tight labor market, allowing us to get good pricing for our services. We see also continued pricing pressure in the more traditional services that we have been talking about in past quarters, where clients are seeking additional cost benefit, and that pricing pressure in those more traditional type of services haven't changed at this point in time."

I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Thank you. You may begin.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2021 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express my support and solidarity for our Indian associates wherever they are in the world. My sympathy for any who have suffered a loss during the pandemic. In addition to the ongoing support of our associates, which includes homecare and hospitalization assistance, vaccination cost reimbursement for our associates and their families, and making vaccine availability easier for those with disabilities. Cognizant is making a multi million dollar investment to assist India through the crisis. This is focused on covering operational expenses at hospitals throughout India that are caring for COVID-19 patients. Funding the efforts of UNICEF in India to deploy oxygen generation plants, COVID diagnostic testing and medical supplies and partnering with one of India's leading hospital chains to set up vaccination centers in locations across the country, including some of Cognizant's own facilities. The impact of the pandemic on industry attrition rates, absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We monitor our situation daily, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates while serving our clients who've been particularly supportive in recent weeks. As the COVID situation differs throughout the world, our return to office strategy remains country driven. Currently, almost all of our associates are working from home, and business travel remains on an exception only basis. Let's turn now to the first quarter. First quarter revenue was $4.4 billion representing growth of 2.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Although, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent. To address retention challenges, we've been executing a multi part plan that includes stepping up our internal engagement efforts and increasing investments in our people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth. Shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable associates, and implementing further salary increases and promotions for high demand skills and critical positions and ramping our hiring capacity by adding hundreds of recruiters and making 28,000 plus offers to new graduates in India. A new record. Daily resignations increased through the first quarter peaking in March.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 4.2% year-over-year, or 2.4% in constant currency, compared with the prior year period. This includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our acquisitions, and 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. Digital revenue in Q1 grew approximately 15% and represented 44% of total revenue versus 39% in the prior year period. We were pleased with this growth acceleration compared to Q4 particularly in light of a competitive hiring environment for digital talent. Now moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 1.7% reflecting more moderate declines in both banking and insurance, in line with our expectations, we are seeing early signs that the investments and repositioning of both businesses are resonating with our clients. This includes financial services bookings growth, outpacing total company bookings growth in Q1 and a solid pipeline growth. We continue to expect a phased recovery for this segment over the next several quarters and anticipate that we will see positive momentum throughout the year. Healthcare growth was 7% and accelerated from last quarter, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare payer and life sciences businesses. Following strong performance in last quarter in Q1, our healthcare business had its best year-over-year growth quarter since 2018 benefiting from increased demand for our integrated payer software solutions, and improving fundamentals in our provider business. Life sciences revenue continued to benefit from strong demand for our digital services among both pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Products and resources increased 2.4% driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. This growth was partially offset by mid single digit declines in retail consumer goods and double digit declines in travel and hospitality.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryanBergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the situation in India. Can you just frame how you're thinking about the potential impact this may have on the business in the near term? And I wanted to confirm is there -- there's nothing built into the outlook right now on a potential revenue disruption? And on the margin front same kind of question. Is there anything built in as far as those incremental costs that you may have framed here to support the workforce in the broader population? Thanks.\nBrianHumphries: Hey, Bryan, it's Brian here. So let me just touch upon this. First of all, I think it's really important for us to acknowledge it is a humanitarian crisis. And we've been prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of course, their dependents and hoping that they stay safe as they work essentially from home at this moment in time. And as I said, in my script, we're doing a series of things to help in terms of medical expense support, pre vaccinations, covering the expenses in hospitals, working with UNICEF, et cetera. To the question around in terms of how I think about the impact on the business, I think about the humanitarian side as being relevant. But candidly, the business side of the hot market is in some regard more meaningful in the sense that most of our attrition, and the resignations we talked about were happening in prior months, which are leading indicators of Q2 attrition, and the end of Q1 attrition. And all of that was happening in a period when the COVID situation in India was substantially less severe than it is at this moment in time. So we're working through obviously, our business operations working with our teams who are working remotely. It's a challenging environment. Of course, it's a stressful and emotional time for associates and their families. The impact Bryan on attrition rates and absenteeism, and client delivery remain somewhat uncertain. We look at it on a daily basis, we have a crisis management teams involved. We've created a COVID delivery risk management process which allows us to initiate remediation actions. We're required to review the status of our delivery portfolio project by project where possible to ship work between offshore or nearshore and on site teams. But I will say clients have been incredibly supportive as we go through this. I've received a series of emails from clients who are wishing us the best of luck and certainly not putting a lot of pressure in the system at this moment in time. The financial impact of our actions is assumed in our guidance. And that is assumed off of what we know today, which is today's rates of absenteeism and today's resignations that we've seen, it is unclear whether attrition will actually slow because of this, or whether attrition will go up or stay stable but it will potentially go up because of -- because of absenteeism. But to date in our guidance includes what we know today. To date, we feel as though our guidance is appropriate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research.\nRodBourgeois: Okay, great. So, Brian, you're a very full two years into your leadership role at Cognizant. When you started at Cognizant there were some meaningful management challenges there waiting for you? You're now navigating a pandemic with multiple ways across regions. So it's definitely been an eventful two years. In that context, I'd like to ask if you can grade Cognizant's underlying progress, the progress that you've made over the last couple years. And if there's a way to decipher between internal progress, market progress, financial progress I'm assuming those dimensions may be progressing at a different stages. But overall, it would be helpful to hear how you grade Cognizant's last two years and its progress.\nBrianHumphries: Thank you, Rod. It's a comprehensive question in nature. But yes, I would echo the word an eventful first two years, given the transformation agenda, the leadership changes required as part of that. Global pandemics and ransomware attack, of course, and now, a war on talent that is happening in the midst of the humanitarian crisis in India. And I would say, first of all, it's a team sport. This is about 300,000 associates pulling in one direction. I'm truly pleased with the executives I've got around me these days, we're all eager to show what we can do, and hopefully, I believe can become an iconic leadership team together in the years ahead. And I've also been supported by a terrific board who've been 100% behind our vision and our strategy of the company. As I'm answering your question, I will start by saying I inherited a great company and a company of great pedigree, and a company with a growth DNA and a company with pride, proud employees. But it is clear that the company had not been hitting its stride in recent years. So I asked our organization to pull together to help me operationalize a broad transformation agenda, which included strategy structure, commercial transformation, delivery, optimization, cultural elements. I also asked the company to help me with a restructuring program that we weren't used to. But it would allow us to free up capacity to make investments in growth in our systems and in our people. And this is a growth company, and we needed to restart the engine. And of course, as part of that, you have to go through the corporate strategy. Who are we? Who do we want to be? That leads to portfolio adjustments, both exits, such as content moderation, as well as meaningful M&A aligned to the corporate strategy. And of course, within that vein, we've also doubled down on partnerships, including hyper scalars. And all of this was just a means to an end, to set out to build a pipeline to accelerate bookings. And ultimately, to get the company back to the industry leading growth. Because I think growth will ultimately make the P&L work again. So we're certainly in the middle of a lot of this. I will say I'm more confident now than ever, that we can do this. And I believe we're on track. We made great progress internally, to go to your framework. Look, we've got a clear purpose vision, a set of values, we got a clear strategy, and we've got a more competitive portfolio that is aligned to our strategy. We've got a better talent philosophy, including DNI which is critical in a knowledge based business. We progress on important things like sustainability, cybersecurity; I think we're getting our belief back. And test them to that is the notion of employee engagement, it multi year highs in 2020. Although, we are fully aware that we got more work to do on our employee value proposition, and indeed, of course on attrition. Commercially and when I'm answering your question on markets, I'm not talking about Wall Street, I'm going to talk about commercial markets as in our clients, we've overhauled our commercial team, we've increased the sophistication of the team, I think we went back to our tuna box model where we got tight alignment between commercial and delivery, we've refined our customer segmentation strategy. So we know who are the clients that we need to partner with deeply, we've implemented a more refined variable compensation program, we've refreshed our talent to ensure we can represent the entire portfolio and address client pain points beyond the CTO or CIO. And I'm excited as to how we're now being seen by clients, Rod, to be honest, where we're no longer necessarily just being viewed and to build or operate space. We got growing reputation and recognition in digital and cloud following our M&A strategy. And that is now showing up in sustained book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.1, which I feel is critical to drive the revenue growth rate that I'm aspiring to drive and our qualified pipeline and win rates are as healthy as they have ever been. Now all of that leads ultimately to financial outcomes. And I don't think the true benefits of this are yet visible. We have seen the margin dilution of the investments, commercial hiring, IT security, modernization, M&A dilutions, and some brand investments we are making. Of course, we continue to review the trade offs between revenue growth and margin expansion. But I will say we expect to see revenue benefits on the back of the bookings, momentum, and margin should improve each year for the foreseeable future, albeit with a balanced approach to trade offs between revenue growth, and further investments to drive a sustained outperformance versus the competition. So in short, a lot of work and I look was a great years ahead.\nRodBourgeois: Great. And just a quick follow up that kind of dovetails with some of the things you mentioned. It seems attrition is a top of the list of things to address at this stage. Can you just speak to what you see as the root factors causing the attrition and your confidence in being able to fix that?\nBrianHumphries: Look, it's a two edged sword. We've seen a V shaped recovery as an industry and Cognizant is certainly as after a weak March and April last year, we snapped back immediately. And that leads with a skill shortage. So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen that in the earning cycle to date. Of course, I caution people to compare attrition rates between various competitors, we include BPO. And our calculation is current quarter annualized, which is the worst of all worlds at this moment in time versus some peers exclude BPO. And look at attrition on a rolling on the last 12 months, which includes some lower levels of attrition because of COVID. But Rod, I think about our attrition, which went up 200 basis points sequentially, against two parameters, one is macro considerations. The market is extremely competitive at this moment in time. There are supply demand imbalances across cloud, across digital engineering, across data. I sense that the work from home environment has given people let's say less sense of community. And I also see obviously, the build out of captives which tend to pressurize salaries. And then on top of that macro backdrop, I think we have some Cognizant considerations as we continue to transform the company. We're driving towards a culture of meritocracy and a performance culture. And we're evolving more towards a global or sometimes local workforce, which is in line with client expectations, but also in line with regulatory policy around the world. And in some regards, we're late to some of those elements. And so we're dealing with some of the pain that others have dealt with previously. I will say I'm 100% confident we're actively managing attrition as best we can. I'm pleased to say that attrition peaked in March, slowed in April and continues to slow in May, albeit early days in May.  We got a lot of work streams around employee engagements, training, job rotations, we've taken the decision to invest more in targeted salary increases and promotions and shifting to quarterly promotion cycles for billable associates. And we've added hundreds of recruiters in the last four months. And we're making a record number of 28,000 offers to new graduates in India, which is up from 17,000 hired in 2020. I think in 2018, we may have actually not even hired any Gen Z graduates into Cognizant and so we're doing the right thing to address attrition. And of course, in the meantime, we're working to manage the salary inflationary elements of this as Jan pointed out, P&A expectations in the second half of the year are lower than previously anticipated. So that will temper some of the downsides. But in the same vein, these are investments that I think will help stem attrition which will give us more productive hours and our employees. And in the same vein, of course, we got other levers at our disposal to manage salary inflation, be that on offshore or nearshore mix pyramid optimization, delivery industrialization, including automation methodologies, templates and the like. Procurement leverage for subcontractors, we get a new chief procurement officer coming on board soon. And of course, everything else we're doing as we evolve the company against the line of work that we actually sell and deliver as we shift from staff augmentation towards managed services and project based delivery transformation. That brings different considerations as well. So we know what we need to do and we're honest. And as I said, I think we'll see sequential increases in attrition based on the resignations in the last few months because there is a two month notice period in India. So we have a strong understanding as to what attrition will be in Q2. But that's been factored into our model and into our guidance. And in the meantime, we've been hiring at record pace, given the extra recruiters we put to work.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Brian. Hi, Jan. So a couple of things I guess. I might have missed this. But can you quantify the revenue growth you were not able to get solely because of the talent shortage? And then when I think of headcount growth, in spite of the hiring, headcount growth still at relatively low sequential levels, is it a question of these folks have not yet joined or is that the net number because of the attrition and could you separate out what is digital headcount growth versus overall headcount growth?\nBrian Humphries: Well, headcount grew about 5,000 people year-over-year, but Ashwin that excludes subcontractors and contingent labor, and they have been increased sequentially and year-over-year materially, it's not a number we disclose. But we have turned to, obviously, external sources, both lateral hires on subcontractors and contingent labor as we've been working through the attrition situation internally, nor do we break out digital versus non digital headcount. I mean to be very clear, you can have somebody working in a test with testing capabilities, and they can work on what could be viewed as legacy projects. But in the same vein, as part of an agile squad, they could be working on something around something as familiar as a frequent flyer website, which some of the work we do around experience and software product engineering there, it's not viewed as legacy, it's certainly viewed as digital. So it's very hard to classify workforce between legacy and digital. With regards to the opportunity cost, look, we're not quantifying that. But certainly it's material enough that talked about when I review countries there's hundreds of basis points of growth, in some cases that we could have had, in other cases less. But it's been a pain point for us throughout the quarter, we talked about attrition being a worry in our last quarter, because we could see resignation rates, and we can see what's happening in the industry as people are doing their best to put in counter offers to stop resignation. And I'm glad we anticipated instead and we set appropriate guidance. And we're doing the same this time around.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Could you comment also on the potential for greater use of technology to decouple revenue and headcount growth?\nBrian Humphries: Well, that's the holy grail, of course, in some regards, but a lot depends on the way you're running your business and the businesses you're winning, whether you're in a BPO type business or a tech services centric project, we have a huge effort underway around automation, not just in delivery, but also some very exciting IP that we have been developing, that hopefully we'll be able to talk about in the next quarter or so that I think will completely set us apart in the industry. So it is a holy grail. Of course, you've also got to think about the pyramids. I told earlier about adding 28,000 offers for fresher into the bottom of the pyramid this year, the bill rates of those will be very different than the rates of onshore delivery. So it's very difficult in a succinct way to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth, because there are so many factors at play. But rest assured that the industrialization of delivery including automation is top of mind for use\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, guys, Brian, I wanted to direct this to you if I could; I want to understand how you're thinking about growth. You've obviously given guidance for the year, but I wanted to see if you could put some context and maybe even some philosophical views on longer term, you're guiding to basically 3% to 4% organic constant currency growth, maybe a little bit closer to the 4% we take out or normalize for the Facebook business. And how should investors be thinking about that growth potential longer term and a, if you could talk a little bit about how the pipeline growth looks now. What are some metrics that you can provide us also in terms of, b, the capacity that you see for incremental M&A from here, whether it's the ability to the financial resources and or the management resources to keep driving M&A? And then finally, c, I was hoping you could touch on financial, it's still candidly serving as an anchor to your growth rate, not in a positive way, but limiting your consolidated growth. And so if you could just, again, touch on how you're thinking about growth pipeline, M&A capacity, and then financial, thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Okay, so M&A, first of all, I think let's go back to the Capital Framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are our guiding principles and we will continue to be opportunistic, approximately 50% towards M&A in areas wholly aligned to our strategic priorities and of course of the remaining 50% towards dividend and share repurchases targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio in the range of about of -- at about -- sorry 25% on that, the rest for repurchases. So M&A will continue to be a priority for us. And as I said earlier, we announced three acquisitions in the first quarter, and indeed signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility. And it's not that -- it's not that M&A is something we wake up every morning and feel we have to do. It's just; it's an enabler for us to achieve our strategy. Now, our strategy is built around accelerating digital which are our higher growth categories. And our strategy is also built around globalizing the company, both from a global Delivery Network, but also getting after exponential growth overseas. And digital as well as our overseas opportunity, I think puts us in a position to have ambitions, well in excess of the 3% to 4% organic growth rate Keith that you mentioned. However, I will refrain from getting into long-term financial statements here. But I would be very, very disappointed in the years ahead if we do not significantly exceed those growth rates. And I would say we have been doing what was needed in the last year, to start replenishing our backlog to consistently drive a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.1.  That puts us in a position that organically coupled with the accretive nature of the acquisitions we've done, we should have continued upward pressure on revenue and a go forward basis. Now, that being said, I will caution everybody, we're in somewhat of an unpredictable world at this moment in time with the humanitarian crisis in India. So that's how I think about organic possibilities, as well as the fact that we have an M&A lever that is exposing us to higher growth categories. And all of this, of course, is against the context where, from my perspective, we are substantially more operationally inclined and more sophisticated in terms of how we think about delivery and commercial leverage going forward.  On financial services, look, it is critical, we turn around financial services, I'm proud with the progress we made in healthcare, which is catching up on financial services as almost being our single biggest industry sector. The financial services are 1/3 of our revenue and in dollar terms, it modestly grew, but in the constant currency terms it declined 1.7%. And Keith within that we ultimately have two groups, we have banking and financial services business that is more than half of the business and we have insurance, which is kind of less than the half. And it's a tale of two cities in insurance North America was weaker than the international business with North American insurance is the vast majority of the insurance business. So that weakness hurt us in banking and financial services. Actually, North America was modestly up, but our international business was down. Within banking and financial services, there are relatively consistent trends, what we talked about previously, capital markets declined, retail banking grew modestly, but it was offset by declines in commercial banks and cards and payments. And if I think about things differently, the global banks, as we call them, have continued to in-source. And that business continues to decline for us, offset somewhat by good momentum we have with some of the regional banks. Now all of this comes back to what are we doing about it? I would say we have a plan of attack. We have had healthy bookings, throughout financial services, both banking and insurance in 2020. We've added extra commercial coverage, we've actually changed out and refreshed a significant amount of our commercial teams, we've been embracing digital, and we've had strong digital bookings in those areas in 2020. And we've been working more with our partners who are very interested in our strength in healthcare, and indeed financial services. So as Jan pointed out it is a business that is under repair. And we expect to see gradual recovery in 2021. We should see strong, stronger growth in Q2, obviously, for easy compare reasons as well as COVID and ransomware attack. But I'd like to think in the course of the year we can get this thing shaped up to be in better shape than it is today.\nKeith Bachman: Thanks. And any comments on pipeline, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Look, pipelines are very healthy overall. It's as healthy as I have seen it and pipeline, candidly for Financial Services is also healthy. So from my perspective, Keith, we don't have a demand issue in an industry. I'm actually quite bullish on the industry for 2020 and indeed for 2021. And that's based on client conversations and I speak with clients every day, as well as obviously we keep an eye on what industry analysts are saying, I think talent shortages and attrition are a greater concern for the entire industry. But clients are making investments, they are decisive. And indecision is the enemy of people like myself. So, clients being decisive are good. They are talking about more strategic partners; we are in the mix more than ever in that vendor consolidation. So I'm quite excited about that.  And fundamentally, the things we see driving the pipeline, a lot around business model innovation, customer experience, technology, modernization, risk mitigation, and efficiency initiatives. And kind of the one of the reasons I was so adamant in doubling down with the hyper scalars, two years ago is because these companies I don't think you should underestimate the sheer power and scale of hyper scale companies, and that they are investing massively by commercial teams, commercial terms, aligning with companies like Cognizant around industries, massively accelerating cloud migrations. And if you believe in platform economics, which opens up the possibilities of micro services and APIs, I think this is going to be the future. So we stood up to business groups or business groups are in the hyperscalers in the last few years, and I think we're reaping the benefits of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Kathy for Jason. So I mean the spring time frame is when enterprises typically make decisions on ramping up and moving forward with some of the discretionary projects. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on that front? Is there any hesitancy or are there any challenges in terms of meeting demand in that regard?\nBrian Humphries: Well, it's very consistent with my last answer, Kathy, to be honest; I am expecting a robust environment. Clients are being decisive, discretionary projects are being funded. I think we've all grown used to the new world. And kind of we're getting at bats more often than ever before. Beyond bill, run, and more in the innovation and transformation agenda. So I feel very good and optimistic about the macro demand picture. But as I said earlier, talent shortages and attrition are a much bigger concern for me at this moment in time than macro demand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. The first one just on M&A just to follow up there. Your Cognizant pace of M&A has increased quite a bit in the last few quarters. Can you just comment a bit on how you're building that muscle? So that it's becomes more of a strategic differentiator for Cognizant like what changes have you made to how you're doing sourcing or integration of these companies? Thank you.\nBrian Humphries: Jan do you want to address that?\nJan Siegmund: Yes, look, the M&A activity had been healthy in the first quarter. So we spent approximately $300 million and announced four acquisitions. But I wouldn't read too much to it as an accelerated pace, I think we're executing against the plan and trying to spend in the framework of the capital that we strategically want to allocate towards M&A and we are executing that. The team has done really a fantastic job in aligning our deal sourcing across industries and across the globe. So you see this, for example. We talked in the last quarter about a slight shift towards more geographic expansion. And we have two deals, this and Australian deal, and, of course, very close to my heart of German deal, also part of the transactions that we could announce and some of them closed. So we executing really, in a classic manner, the team is very focused partnering with our markets and with our service lines on identifying the strategic areas of growth that we want to do. And it's been very diligent and creative of identifying acquisition opportunities. It has really worked really well. And I think the natural spacing of these things will lead us to kind of execute against our allocated capital against it. Now it's what we have been lumpy in and out, but a consistent way to do so.  The focus in the company is clearly on integration, because the synergies that these companies deliver are at the heart of the viability of all M&A strategy. And we are pleased with the ability to generate synergies. Our business plans are generally pretty close to the reality on the revenue synergies, and as we now have a larger portfolios of companies that we have acquired, we have increased our focus, like naturally on integration and efficiencies so that these companies can fit into the fabric of Cognizant and benefit from the scale that we can bring to the table. You see, we have still dilution from acquisitions, putting pressure on our margin. And so you'll see us continuing working on driving integration and reaping also some of the cost efficiencies that might be available to us in the future.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific, thank you. And then just a quick follow up. I know, Brian, you mentioned that now you've had a 1.1, or greater book-to-bill for, I think, more than a year now on a very sustained basis. Can you just kind of comment on how you're feeling about the backlog at this point, your confidence level, whether it's improved in kind of your visibility into the sales pipeline and sales forecasting? Thanks.\nBrian Humphries: Yes, actually, I should thank Jan for this when he came in, he did a tremendous job, really decomposing down prior bookings, and tracing them to follow the breadcrumbs into revenue. And so at this moment in time, we have much better visibility into that than we had this time last year. I really feel good about our bookings momentum, to your point, really, since the last, if you think about it, throughout 2020, we had an exceptionally strong Q1. And then through the course of the year, we had strength with mid teams for the course of the year. But really, in 2019, it starts you don't get bookings until you start building a pipeline. So we really put a lot of efforts in the second half of 2022 to pipeline build that started showing up in terms of bookings momentum in 2020. And then, of course, into 2021. We don't have the same easy compares now as we had last year, which is why I want you to really contextualize Q1 bookings growth of 5%. I actually am delighted with that, because our December was really outstanding. It was an excellent month for us. And April has been an excellent month. So the Q1 period has been sandwiched between that. And it's really important to me that people think about bookings on a on a rolling four quarter basis, because something stepping from the Friday to a Monday, or vice versa, could take a deal from Q1 to Q2, or Q1 to Q4. So it's important to contextualize that. So book-to-bill is the right way to also think about it. I think once you're north of 1.1x, it creates a backlog of opportunity to go execute against and hopefully accelerate revenue on from here. So we're confident of in our numbers. And we're also confident we'll have a very strong Q2 bookings number on the back not just of excellent April results, but also let's face it the compare wasn't exactly stellar in May, this time last year for many other reasons.\nOperator: Our last question comes from a line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien Huang: Hey, thanks so much. I know you're at the bottom of the hour here. I just want to get a clarification here on the margin side and just ask it at a high level is just a cost of doing business is going up? I mean, I see your gross margin in the first quarter was pretty good. But I know you move into the lower end on the margins side, you said to Lisa, that some of the M&A integration costs are going up. I understand that. But is the rest of it just people and again, is the cost of doing business overall, just maybe gone higher than you expected 90 days ago.\nBrian Humphries: Tien-Tsin, thank you for the question. I was wondering if it wouldn't come actually so appreciate it as well, because there's a lot of momentum and movement in our margins that I think is important to put our eyes on. When you compare our margins, overall operating margin, we kind of roughly flat slightly improved year-over-year and on the gross margin side you see the benefits of our Fit for Growth. And you can see also the benefits of the lower T&E that helped us to expand the growth margins. Utilization helped a little bit and also we had obviously a little bit help in the rupee that all help on the margin side. But then we had on the SG&A side, you see an accelerated growth, but we're really laser focused on directing that SG&A growth to our strategic initiatives that we think will yield.  We view them as investments will yield accelerating revenue growth rates, and you pointed out the two biggest items M&A is and its dilutive element in its initial years, as well as our investments into sales and account management and growth, in essence, those are two offsetting factors that we have seen in the past quarters, but also, this quarter, when we now outlook, you're pointing out, we are basically down taking our margin guidance a tiny bit. I think that is reflective of a balance that we're trying to strike here, reflecting what we anticipate could be some increase in our compensation costs due to the measures in order to lower attrition attract and retain our talent. And we're planning to offset that partially with some changes assumptions, I think the crisis in India illustrates that maybe T&E is not coming back as fast as we had anticipated. And we'll also carefully and surgically monitoring our future SG&A growth to tie it all so that we keep the overall margin equation together for the full year. But the second quarter will be kind of in line or similar to our first quarter margin expectation, and particularly since we're anticipating the SG&A moderation to accelerate basically in the third and fourth quarter, but some of the compensation measures will be probably visible already in the second quarter.\nTien Huang: Thank you for going through that. That was very clear, Jan, so maybe it's a quick follow up. Just you didn't mention contract execution and performance. So I'm assuming things are going well there any update on contract execution? And risk management has identified any changes since last quarter on the portfolio?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. I presume you refer to our management of escalations, deals, et cetera. I think we have had a very usual quarter; we made progress on our implementation of improvements for deal reviews and deal acceptance and pricing. As we rolled out, those initiatives are gaining momentum. And on the delivery side, I think the issues that we're hearing the most and Brian mentioned it is obviously our ability to fulfill and to have talent available is a primary concern of our clients. But overall, I would say it's a -- was a very solid quarter relative to execution.\nBrian Humphries: All right. I think with that, we'll end today's call. Thank you all for the questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to start today's call by addressing the humanitarian crisis in India. As many of you know, India is the heart of Cognizant, and home to more than 200,000 of our associates. I would like to express my support and solidarity for our Indian associates wherever they are in the world. My sympathy for any who have suffered a loss during the pandemic. In addition to the ongoing support of our associates, which includes homecare and hospitalization assistance, vaccination cost reimbursement for our associates and their families, and making vaccine availability easier for those with disabilities. Cognizant is making a multi million dollar investment to assist India through the crisis. This is focused on covering operational expenses at hospitals throughout India that are caring for COVID-19 patients. Funding the efforts of UNICEF in India to deploy oxygen generation plants, COVID diagnostic testing and medical supplies and partnering with one of India's leading hospital chains to set up vaccination centers in locations across the country, including some of Cognizant's own facilities. The impact of the pandemic on industry attrition rates, absenteeism and client delivery remains somewhat uncertain. We monitor our situation daily, and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates while serving our clients who've been particularly supportive in recent weeks. As the COVID situation differs throughout the world, our return to office strategy remains country driven. Currently, almost all of our associates are working from home, and business travel remains on an exception only basis. Let's turn now to the first quarter. First quarter revenue was $4.4 billion representing growth of 2.4% year-over-year in constant currency. Although, we executed well in the quarter and delivered against our expectations, revenue upside was limited by elevated attrition, reflecting the intensely competitive market for digital talent that we spoke about in our last earnings call. This put some pressure on salaries as rows were filled by lateral hires or contingent workforce. And in some cases, commercial opportunities were forgone due to an inability to source talent. To address retention challenges, we've been executing a multi part plan that includes stepping up our internal engagement efforts and increasing investments in our people through training and job rotations to provide opportunities for career growth. Shifting to a quarterly promotion cycle for billable associates, and implementing further salary increases and promotions for high demand skills and critical positions and ramping our hiring capacity by adding hundreds of recruiters and making 28,000 plus offers to new graduates in India. A new record. Daily resignations increased through the first quarter peaking in March. Hey, Bryan, it's Brian here. So let me just touch upon this. First of all, I think it's really important for us to acknowledge it is a humanitarian crisis. And we've been prioritizing the health and safety of our associates and of course, their dependents and hoping that they stay safe as they work essentially from home at this moment in time. And as I said, in my script, we're doing a series of things to help in terms of medical expense support, pre vaccinations, covering the expenses in hospitals, working with UNICEF, et cetera. To the question around in terms of how I think about the impact on the business, I think about the humanitarian side as being relevant. But candidly, the business side of the hot market is in some regard more meaningful in the sense that most of our attrition, and the resignations we talked about were happening in prior months, which are leading indicators of Q2 attrition, and the end of Q1 attrition. And all of that was happening in a period when the COVID situation in India was substantially less severe than it is at this moment in time. So we're working through obviously, our business operations working with our teams who are working remotely. It's a challenging environment. Of course, it's a stressful and emotional time for associates and their families. The impact Bryan on attrition rates and absenteeism, and client delivery remain somewhat uncertain. We look at it on a daily basis, we have a crisis management teams involved. We've created a COVID delivery risk management process which allows us to initiate remediation actions. We're required to review the status of our delivery portfolio project by project where possible to ship work between offshore or nearshore and on site teams. But I will say clients have been incredibly supportive as we go through this. I've received a series of emails from clients who are wishing us the best of luck and certainly not putting a lot of pressure in the system at this moment in time. The financial impact of our actions is assumed in our guidance. And that is assumed off of what we know today, which is today's rates of absenteeism and today's resignations that we've seen, it is unclear whether attrition will actually slow because of this, or whether attrition will go up or stay stable but it will potentially go up because of -- because of absenteeism. But to date in our guidance includes what we know today. To date, we feel as though our guidance is appropriate. Thank you, Rod. It's a comprehensive question in nature. But yes, I would echo the word an eventful first two years, given the transformation agenda, the leadership changes required as part of that. Global pandemics and ransomware attack, of course, and now, a war on talent that is happening in the midst of the humanitarian crisis in India. And I would say, first of all, it's a team sport. This is about 300,000 associates pulling in one direction. I'm truly pleased with the executives I've got around me these days, we're all eager to show what we can do, and hopefully, I believe can become an iconic leadership team together in the years ahead. And I've also been supported by a terrific board who've been 100% behind our vision and our strategy of the company. As I'm answering your question, I will start by saying I inherited a great company and a company of great pedigree, and a company with a growth DNA and a company with pride, proud employees. But it is clear that the company had not been hitting its stride in recent years. So I asked our organization to pull together to help me operationalize a broad transformation agenda, which included strategy structure, commercial transformation, delivery, optimization, cultural elements. I also asked the company to help me with a restructuring program that we weren't used to. But it would allow us to free up capacity to make investments in growth in our systems and in our people. And this is a growth company, and we needed to restart the engine. And of course, as part of that, you have to go through the corporate strategy. Who are we? Who do we want to be? That leads to portfolio adjustments, both exits, such as content moderation, as well as meaningful M&A aligned to the corporate strategy. And of course, within that vein, we've also doubled down on partnerships, including hyper scalars. And all of this was just a means to an end, to set out to build a pipeline to accelerate bookings. And ultimately, to get the company back to the industry leading growth. Because I think growth will ultimately make the P&L work again. So we're certainly in the middle of a lot of this. I will say I'm more confident now than ever, that we can do this. And I believe we're on track. We made great progress internally, to go to your framework. Look, we've got a clear purpose vision, a set of values, we got a clear strategy, and we've got a more competitive portfolio that is aligned to our strategy. We've got a better talent philosophy, including DNI which is critical in a knowledge based business. We progress on important things like sustainability, cybersecurity; I think we're getting our belief back. And test them to that is the notion of employee engagement, it multi year highs in 2020. Although, we are fully aware that we got more work to do on our employee value proposition, and indeed, of course on attrition. Commercially and when I'm answering your question on markets, I'm not talking about Wall Street, I'm going to talk about commercial markets as in our clients, we've overhauled our commercial team, we've increased the sophistication of the team, I think we went back to our tuna box model where we got tight alignment between commercial and delivery, we've refined our customer segmentation strategy. So we know who are the clients that we need to partner with deeply, we've implemented a more refined variable compensation program, we've refreshed our talent to ensure we can represent the entire portfolio and address client pain points beyond the CTO or CIO. And I'm excited as to how we're now being seen by clients, Rod, to be honest, where we're no longer necessarily just being viewed and to build or operate space. We got growing reputation and recognition in digital and cloud following our M&A strategy. And that is now showing up in sustained book-to-bill ratios in excess of 1.1, which I feel is critical to drive the revenue growth rate that I'm aspiring to drive and our qualified pipeline and win rates are as healthy as they have ever been. Now all of that leads ultimately to financial outcomes. And I don't think the true benefits of this are yet visible. We have seen the margin dilution of the investments, commercial hiring, IT security, modernization, M&A dilutions, and some brand investments we are making. Of course, we continue to review the trade offs between revenue growth and margin expansion. But I will say we expect to see revenue benefits on the back of the bookings, momentum, and margin should improve each year for the foreseeable future, albeit with a balanced approach to trade offs between revenue growth, and further investments to drive a sustained outperformance versus the competition. So in short, a lot of work and I look was a great years ahead. Look, it's a two edged sword. We've seen a V shaped recovery as an industry and Cognizant is certainly as after a weak March and April last year, we snapped back immediately. And that leads with a skill shortage. So it's an industry problem. I think you've seen that in the earning cycle to date. Of course, I caution people to compare attrition rates between various competitors, we include BPO. And our calculation is current quarter annualized, which is the worst of all worlds at this moment in time versus some peers exclude BPO. And look at attrition on a rolling on the last 12 months, which includes some lower levels of attrition because of COVID. But Rod, I think about our attrition, which went up 200 basis points sequentially, against two parameters, one is macro considerations. The market is extremely competitive at this moment in time. There are supply demand imbalances across cloud, across digital engineering, across data. I sense that the work from home environment has given people let's say less sense of community. And I also see obviously, the build out of captives which tend to pressurize salaries. And then on top of that macro backdrop, I think we have some Cognizant considerations as we continue to transform the company. We're driving towards a culture of meritocracy and a performance culture. And we're evolving more towards a global or sometimes local workforce, which is in line with client expectations, but also in line with regulatory policy around the world. And in some regards, we're late to some of those elements. And so we're dealing with some of the pain that others have dealt with previously. I will say I'm 100% confident we're actively managing attrition as best we can. I'm pleased to say that attrition peaked in March, slowed in April and continues to slow in May, albeit early days in May.  We got a lot of work streams around employee engagements, training, job rotations, we've taken the decision to invest more in targeted salary increases and promotions and shifting to quarterly promotion cycles for billable associates. And we've added hundreds of recruiters in the last four months. And we're making a record number of 28,000 offers to new graduates in India, which is up from 17,000 hired in 2020. I think in 2018, we may have actually not even hired any Gen Z graduates into Cognizant and so we're doing the right thing to address attrition. And of course, in the meantime, we're working to manage the salary inflationary elements of this as Jan pointed out, P&A expectations in the second half of the year are lower than previously anticipated. So that will temper some of the downsides. But in the same vein, these are investments that I think will help stem attrition which will give us more productive hours and our employees. And in the same vein, of course, we got other levers at our disposal to manage salary inflation, be that on offshore or nearshore mix pyramid optimization, delivery industrialization, including automation methodologies, templates and the like. Procurement leverage for subcontractors, we get a new chief procurement officer coming on board soon. And of course, everything else we're doing as we evolve the company against the line of work that we actually sell and deliver as we shift from staff augmentation towards managed services and project based delivery transformation. That brings different considerations as well. So we know what we need to do and we're honest. And as I said, I think we'll see sequential increases in attrition based on the resignations in the last few months because there is a two month notice period in India. So we have a strong understanding as to what attrition will be in Q2. But that's been factored into our model and into our guidance. And in the meantime, we've been hiring at record pace, given the extra recruiters we put to work. Well, headcount grew about 5,000 people year-over-year, but Ashwin that excludes subcontractors and contingent labor, and they have been increased sequentially and year-over-year materially, it's not a number we disclose. But we have turned to, obviously, external sources, both lateral hires on subcontractors and contingent labor as we've been working through the attrition situation internally, nor do we break out digital versus non digital headcount. I mean to be very clear, you can have somebody working in a test with testing capabilities, and they can work on what could be viewed as legacy projects. But in the same vein, as part of an agile squad, they could be working on something around something as familiar as a frequent flyer website, which some of the work we do around experience and software product engineering there, it's not viewed as legacy, it's certainly viewed as digital. So it's very hard to classify workforce between legacy and digital. With regards to the opportunity cost, look, we're not quantifying that. But certainly it's material enough that talked about when I review countries there's hundreds of basis points of growth, in some cases that we could have had, in other cases less. But it's been a pain point for us throughout the quarter, we talked about attrition being a worry in our last quarter, because we could see resignation rates, and we can see what's happening in the industry as people are doing their best to put in counter offers to stop resignation. And I'm glad we anticipated instead and we set appropriate guidance. And we're doing the same this time around. Well, that's the holy grail, of course, in some regards, but a lot depends on the way you're running your business and the businesses you're winning, whether you're in a BPO type business or a tech services centric project, we have a huge effort underway around automation, not just in delivery, but also some very exciting IP that we have been developing, that hopefully we'll be able to talk about in the next quarter or so that I think will completely set us apart in the industry. So it is a holy grail. Of course, you've also got to think about the pyramids. I told earlier about adding 28,000 offers for fresher into the bottom of the pyramid this year, the bill rates of those will be very different than the rates of onshore delivery. So it's very difficult in a succinct way to decouple revenue growth from headcount growth, because there are so many factors at play. But rest assured that the industrialization of delivery including automation is top of mind for use Okay, so M&A, first of all, I think let's go back to the Capital Framework we've set forth in recent quarters. We plan to deploy approximately 100% of our annual free cash flow through a balanced capital allocation program. I will say these are our guiding principles and we will continue to be opportunistic, approximately 50% towards M&A in areas wholly aligned to our strategic priorities and of course of the remaining 50% towards dividend and share repurchases targeting a consistent dividend payout ratio in the range of about of -- at about -- sorry 25% on that, the rest for repurchases. So M&A will continue to be a priority for us. And as I said earlier, we announced three acquisitions in the first quarter, and indeed signed an agreement to acquire ESG Mobility. And it's not that -- it's not that M&A is something we wake up every morning and feel we have to do. It's just; it's an enabler for us to achieve our strategy. Now, our strategy is built around accelerating digital which are our higher growth categories. And our strategy is also built around globalizing the company, both from a global Delivery Network, but also getting after exponential growth overseas. And digital as well as our overseas opportunity, I think puts us in a position to have ambitions, well in excess of the 3% to 4% organic growth rate Keith that you mentioned. However, I will refrain from getting into long-term financial statements here. But I would be very, very disappointed in the years ahead if we do not significantly exceed those growth rates. And I would say we have been doing what was needed in the last year, to start replenishing our backlog to consistently drive a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 1.1.  That puts us in a position that organically coupled with the accretive nature of the acquisitions we've done, we should have continued upward pressure on revenue and a go forward basis. Now, that being said, I will caution everybody, we're in somewhat of an unpredictable world at this moment in time with the humanitarian crisis in India. So that's how I think about organic possibilities, as well as the fact that we have an M&A lever that is exposing us to higher growth categories. And all of this, of course, is against the context where, from my perspective, we are substantially more operationally inclined and more sophisticated in terms of how we think about delivery and commercial leverage going forward.  On financial services, look, it is critical, we turn around financial services, I'm proud with the progress we made in healthcare, which is catching up on financial services as almost being our single biggest industry sector. The financial services are 1/3 of our revenue and in dollar terms, it modestly grew, but in the constant currency terms it declined 1.7%. And Keith within that we ultimately have two groups, we have banking and financial services business that is more than half of the business and we have insurance, which is kind of less than the half. And it's a tale of two cities in insurance North America was weaker than the international business with North American insurance is the vast majority of the insurance business. So that weakness hurt us in banking and financial services. Actually, North America was modestly up, but our international business was down. Within banking and financial services, there are relatively consistent trends, what we talked about previously, capital markets declined, retail banking grew modestly, but it was offset by declines in commercial banks and cards and payments. And if I think about things differently, the global banks, as we call them, have continued to in-source. And that business continues to decline for us, offset somewhat by good momentum we have with some of the regional banks. Now all of this comes back to what are we doing about it? I would say we have a plan of attack. We have had healthy bookings, throughout financial services, both banking and insurance in 2020. We've added extra commercial coverage, we've actually changed out and refreshed a significant amount of our commercial teams, we've been embracing digital, and we've had strong digital bookings in those areas in 2020. And we've been working more with our partners who are very interested in our strength in healthcare, and indeed financial services. So as Jan pointed out it is a business that is under repair. And we expect to see gradual recovery in 2021. We should see strong, stronger growth in Q2, obviously, for easy compare reasons as well as COVID and ransomware attack. But I'd like to think in the course of the year we can get this thing shaped up to be in better shape than it is today. Look, pipelines are very healthy overall. It's as healthy as I have seen it and pipeline, candidly for Financial Services is also healthy. So from my perspective, Keith, we don't have a demand issue in an industry. I'm actually quite bullish on the industry for 2020 and indeed for 2021. And that's based on client conversations and I speak with clients every day, as well as obviously we keep an eye on what industry analysts are saying, I think talent shortages and attrition are a greater concern for the entire industry. But clients are making investments, they are decisive. And indecision is the enemy of people like myself. So, clients being decisive are good. They are talking about more strategic partners; we are in the mix more than ever in that vendor consolidation. So I'm quite excited about that.  And fundamentally, the things we see driving the pipeline, a lot around business model innovation, customer experience, technology, modernization, risk mitigation, and efficiency initiatives. And kind of the one of the reasons I was so adamant in doubling down with the hyper scalars, two years ago is because these companies I don't think you should underestimate the sheer power and scale of hyper scale companies, and that they are investing massively by commercial teams, commercial terms, aligning with companies like Cognizant around industries, massively accelerating cloud migrations. And if you believe in platform economics, which opens up the possibilities of micro services and APIs, I think this is going to be the future. So we stood up to business groups or business groups are in the hyperscalers in the last few years, and I think we're reaping the benefits of that. Well, it's very consistent with my last answer, Kathy, to be honest; I am expecting a robust environment. Clients are being decisive, discretionary projects are being funded. I think we've all grown used to the new world. And kind of we're getting at bats more often than ever before. Beyond bill, run, and more in the innovation and transformation agenda. So I feel very good and optimistic about the macro demand picture. But as I said earlier, talent shortages and attrition are a much bigger concern for me at this moment in time than macro demand. Jan do you want to address that? Yes, actually, I should thank Jan for this when he came in, he did a tremendous job, really decomposing down prior bookings, and tracing them to follow the breadcrumbs into revenue. And so at this moment in time, we have much better visibility into that than we had this time last year. I really feel good about our bookings momentum, to your point, really, since the last, if you think about it, throughout 2020, we had an exceptionally strong Q1. And then through the course of the year, we had strength with mid teams for the course of the year. But really, in 2019, it starts you don't get bookings until you start building a pipeline. So we really put a lot of efforts in the second half of 2022 to pipeline build that started showing up in terms of bookings momentum in 2020. And then, of course, into 2021. We don't have the same easy compares now as we had last year, which is why I want you to really contextualize Q1 bookings growth of 5%. I actually am delighted with that, because our December was really outstanding. It was an excellent month for us. And April has been an excellent month. So the Q1 period has been sandwiched between that. And it's really important to me that people think about bookings on a on a rolling four quarter basis, because something stepping from the Friday to a Monday, or vice versa, could take a deal from Q1 to Q2, or Q1 to Q4. So it's important to contextualize that. So book-to-bill is the right way to also think about it. I think once you're north of 1.1x, it creates a backlog of opportunity to go execute against and hopefully accelerate revenue on from here. So we're confident of in our numbers. And we're also confident we'll have a very strong Q2 bookings number on the back not just of excellent April results, but also let's face it the compare wasn't exactly stellar in May, this time last year for many other reasons. Tien-Tsin, thank you for the question. I was wondering if it wouldn't come actually so appreciate it as well, because there's a lot of momentum and movement in our margins that I think is important to put our eyes on. When you compare our margins, overall operating margin, we kind of roughly flat slightly improved year-over-year and on the gross margin side you see the benefits of our Fit for Growth. And you can see also the benefits of the lower T&E that helped us to expand the growth margins. Utilization helped a little bit and also we had obviously a little bit help in the rupee that all help on the margin side. But then we had on the SG&A side, you see an accelerated growth, but we're really laser focused on directing that SG&A growth to our strategic initiatives that we think will yield.  We view them as investments will yield accelerating revenue growth rates, and you pointed out the two biggest items M&A is and its dilutive element in its initial years, as well as our investments into sales and account management and growth, in essence, those are two offsetting factors that we have seen in the past quarters, but also, this quarter, when we now outlook, you're pointing out, we are basically down taking our margin guidance a tiny bit. I think that is reflective of a balance that we're trying to strike here, reflecting what we anticipate could be some increase in our compensation costs due to the measures in order to lower attrition attract and retain our talent. And we're planning to offset that partially with some changes assumptions, I think the crisis in India illustrates that maybe T&E is not coming back as fast as we had anticipated. And we'll also carefully and surgically monitoring our future SG&A growth to tie it all so that we keep the overall margin equation together for the full year. But the second quarter will be kind of in line or similar to our first quarter margin expectation, and particularly since we're anticipating the SG&A moderation to accelerate basically in the third and fourth quarter, but some of the compensation measures will be probably visible already in the second quarter. All right. I think with that, we'll end today's call. Thank you all for the questions and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q1 revenue was $4.4 billion, representing growth of 4.2% year-over-year, or 2.4% in constant currency, compared with the prior year period. This includes approximately 300 basis points of growth from our acquisitions, and 90 basis points of negative impact from the exit of certain content services. Digital revenue in Q1 grew approximately 15% and represented 44% of total revenue versus 39% in the prior year period. We were pleased with this growth acceleration compared to Q4 particularly in light of a competitive hiring environment for digital talent. Now moving on to segment results, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services declined 1.7% reflecting more moderate declines in both banking and insurance, in line with our expectations, we are seeing early signs that the investments and repositioning of both businesses are resonating with our clients. This includes financial services bookings growth, outpacing total company bookings growth in Q1 and a solid pipeline growth. We continue to expect a phased recovery for this segment over the next several quarters and anticipate that we will see positive momentum throughout the year. Healthcare growth was 7% and accelerated from last quarter, driven by strong performance in both our healthcare payer and life sciences businesses. Following strong performance in last quarter in Q1, our healthcare business had its best year-over-year growth quarter since 2018 benefiting from increased demand for our integrated payer software solutions, and improving fundamentals in our provider business. Life sciences revenue continued to benefit from strong demand for our digital services among both pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Products and resources increased 2.4% driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. This growth was partially offset by mid single digit declines in retail consumer goods and double digit declines in travel and hospitality. Yes, look, the M&A activity had been healthy in the first quarter. So we spent approximately $300 million and announced four acquisitions. But I wouldn't read too much to it as an accelerated pace, I think we're executing against the plan and trying to spend in the framework of the capital that we strategically want to allocate towards M&A and we are executing that. The team has done really a fantastic job in aligning our deal sourcing across industries and across the globe. So you see this, for example. We talked in the last quarter about a slight shift towards more geographic expansion. And we have two deals, this and Australian deal, and, of course, very close to my heart of German deal, also part of the transactions that we could announce and some of them closed. So we executing really, in a classic manner, the team is very focused partnering with our markets and with our service lines on identifying the strategic areas of growth that we want to do. And it's been very diligent and creative of identifying acquisition opportunities. It has really worked really well. And I think the natural spacing of these things will lead us to kind of execute against our allocated capital against it. Now it's what we have been lumpy in and out, but a consistent way to do so.  The focus in the company is clearly on integration, because the synergies that these companies deliver are at the heart of the viability of all M&A strategy. And we are pleased with the ability to generate synergies. Our business plans are generally pretty close to the reality on the revenue synergies, and as we now have a larger portfolios of companies that we have acquired, we have increased our focus, like naturally on integration and efficiencies so that these companies can fit into the fabric of Cognizant and benefit from the scale that we can bring to the table. You see, we have still dilution from acquisitions, putting pressure on our margin. And so you'll see us continuing working on driving integration and reaping also some of the cost efficiencies that might be available to us in the future. Yes. I presume you refer to our management of escalations, deals, et cetera. I think we have had a very usual quarter; we made progress on our implementation of improvements for deal reviews and deal acceptance and pricing. As we rolled out, those initiatives are gaining momentum. And on the delivery side, I think the issues that we're hearing the most and Brian mentioned it is obviously our ability to fulfill and to have talent available is a primary concern of our clients. But overall, I would say it's a -- was a very solid quarter relative to execution."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Steve Rohleder, Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors; Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures or appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Steve. Please go ahead.\nSteve Rohleder: Thank you, Tyler, and thank you all for joining us today. Given the recent news, I wanted to join the call for this quarter to introduce myself and explain the changes we've recently announced. For those of you that don't know me, I'm Steve Rohleder, and I joined the Board as an Independent Director in March of 2022. Last month, I became Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors. I previously spent 35 years at Accenture, where I served as Group Chief Executive of Health and Public Services, Chief Executive of North America and Chief Operating Officer. Today, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent CEO transition and the Board changes announced this afternoon supporting our ongoing Board refreshment process. I also want to explain why we're excited for Cognizant's next chapter. Ravi will then introduce himself and share his thoughts before Jan discusses our fourth quarter results in detail. We'll then proceed to Q&A. Regarding our CEO transition, as we announced a few weeks ago, the Board appointed Ravi Kumar to succeed Brian Humphries as CEO. Brian was a resilient leader providing a steady hand as he steered the company through various challenges, including the global pandemic. On behalf of the Board, management and all of our associates, I want to thank Brian for his contributions, which have helped to position Cognizant to capture a large growing market and fuel profitable revenue growth beyond our short-term challenges. We also appreciate that Brian will remain with the company as a special adviser until March to ensure a seamless transition. As part of the Board's strategy to help Cognizant achieve long-term sustainable growth, we also announced today a new Board appointment. Eric Branderiz, a proven financial executive and public company director with demonstrated experience supporting growth in technology and in the energy industries, has been appointed to serve as an Independent Director on the Board. Eric brings significant experience in finance, accounting, M&A execution, risk management and ESG and corporate governance to Cognizant, and we welcome him to the Board. The appointment comes as our Board continues to strive towards optimizing its balance of director skills and tenures as part of its ongoing refreshment program. With Eric's appointment, the Board has appointed five new independent directors over the last four years. Maureen Breakiron-Evans, a member of the Board since 2009, has also advised the Board that she will not stand for reelection at Cognizant's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On behalf of the entire Board, we thank her for her more than a decade of astute guidance, exceptional leadership and dedicated service to Cognizant. Given these changes to the Board, our Governance Committee, our committee chairs and myself will perform a comprehensive evaluation of committee composition with an aim toward balancing representation of Board tenure and appropriate key skills and qualifications on our committees. These were topics that I, along with other members of the Board, had the pleasure of discussing with several of our largest investors during our annual governance road show in the fourth quarter. Now before I turn the call over to Ravi, let me share a little bit about our enthusiasm for his leadership. Over the past few years, Cognizant has navigated a dynamic uncertain market while strengthening its operational and financial fundamentals. Heading into 2023, the Board believes that Cognizant has established a solid operational foundation and now needs to move toward accelerating growth. This agenda requires a focused growth mindset driven from the C-Suite. Ravi has this mindset. He brings a passion for building teams and driving growth in our industry, and we're confident that he is the right leader to take Cognizant into our next phase with a goal of ultimately delivering significant returns to our shareholders. Ravi also brings to Cognizant best-in-class operations, transformation and leadership expertise at a global scale from a stellar 20-year track record of emphasis. During his tenure, he oversaw the company's global services organization and drove growth across its global industry segments. Ravi is a proven strategist who secured significant IT services deals. He led international business operations in India, Latin America, Japan and China, and he pioneered the creation of digital talent pools in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Importantly, during his time at Infosys, Ravi earned a reputation as a people-focused leader with a deep rooted commitment to teams and associates. Since he joined us a few weeks ago, Ravi has proven out this reputation as Cognizant associates have warmly welcomed into the team and are deeply enthusiastic about his leadership. We're confident that Ravi will help us further our efforts to support engagement and trust internally and drive retention amongst our high-performing leaders and associates. As we look forward under Ravi's leadership, Cognizant will have a sharp focus on two key priorities. First, we'll be focused on meaningful acceleration of revenue growth. Our second key priority will be ensuring that Cognizant is the employer of choice in our industry. Ravi is the right leader to achieve this vision, and the Board looks forward to partnering with him. I'll now turn the call over to Ravi to introduce himself and to share some additional perspective.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Steve, for that very warm introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. My appointment as CEO is one of the proudest moments of my life. I'm excited as well as humbled by this opportunity to lead Cognizant, a company I've long admired, closely watched and competed against. As I've experienced, Cognizant has a diverse, highly skilled and a fully engaged Board. I'm grateful for the Board's trust and support and for their efforts to lay the groundwork for me and the company to flourish. I'm also very grateful to my predecessor, Brian Humphries, who led the evolution of Cognizant's business. He refreshed and broadened the strategy, extended the company's portfolio and drove the implementation of more rigorous systems and processes. With a very strong foundation in place, I'm not going back to the drawing board. Instead, I plan to move forward by building on and refining what already exists, which will include calibrating a thinking to a growth mindset. I want to see us offer the full breadth of our industry-specific solutions, whether developed organically or acquired through targeted acquisitions to a large installed base of clients and investor growth. A few days after my appointment, I participated in Cognizant's annual sales kickoff, which was held in Abu Dhabi. At the summit, 1,000 of our client-facing associates came together from around the world to take stock of all of what we have and what we need to accelerate growth. I was so deeply moved by the warmth and the enthusiasm I was greeted with. We set ourselves a goal to be an employer of choice, which we believe will be a pivot for growth. I plan to spend the next several months meeting with so many associates, clients, partners and shareholders as much as I can. I will listen carefully with an open mind, build trust and learn all I can about how best to unlock more value for clients, make progress in accelerating top line growth and drive long-term shareholder value. Because I like to be highly visible with clients and associates, my plan is to meet with 100 clients over 100 days whether in person or virtually and to visit with as many of our global teams as I can. Later this quarter, I'm spending several weeks in India and visiting associates at many of our locations across the country. Having joined Cognizant just three weeks ago, I'm early in my learning curve and need time to get my hands on the pulse of the business. That said, I \u2013 while already identified several areas that are tied to operating with a growth mindset to focus on immediately. Today, I will look to talk about three of those important areas: first, making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; second, strengthening our ability to win large deals; and third, enhancing our operating discipline. A quick word on each starting with employer of choice. Spent time in the IT services industry, and you quickly realize that sustained success hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent. The value we create for clients comes from the knowledge of the skills of our associates. Because the client experience and the employee experience are so tightly linked, we have the opportunity to create a self-reinforcing cycle. Highly engaged client \u2013 talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. That's why one of our goals and one of my specific important roles as the CEO is creating conditions for all our associates to excel. I'm committed to investing heavily in providing associates with continuous learning, upscaling and leadership development, all aimed at increasing the professional relevance. I believe the number one factor that will define success for Cognizant is to become the employer of choice in our industry. Everything else must be based on that foundation, especially the ability to consistently deliver industry-leading growth, which is the absolute focus of the entire management team.  Let's turn to large deals, which are another top priority given how essential they are to building commercial momentum and enhancing our station as a provider of business outcomes aligned by industry. Accelerating large deal bookings that will align with our risk appetite requires the client centricity and competitive self-confidence to work the corridors of our clients, cultivating and mining existing relationships, while hunting for new ones and always showing up with an informed point of view. Over the last year or so, Cognizant business has advanced its solutioning capabilities along with its project and program management processes. We have become better equipped to solution and manage large deals and have planned to build on this foundation to reenergize our efforts. In particular, I want to instill a greater sense of pride and empowerment among our client partners and delivery teams to encourage a faster, more agile response to client needs. I have a weekly standing meeting during which I review 10 large deals and do everything I can to help our teams to drive these deals over the finish line. Last week, we were pleased to announce the signing of a 10-year $1 billion renewal contract with a long-standing client, CoreLogic, demonstrating our capabilities and the confidence our clients place in us. The third area of focus is ensuring operational excellence across the company, including our approach to large deals and fulfillment in general. We are building out an organizational structure designed to bring together a continuum of activities such as industrialized delivery with high productivity rates, market competitive cost takeout initiatives, contract life cycle and risk management, consortium led deals and more. As one Cognizant team, we are also working on internal simplification as a team. We will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. With the market for tech talent showing some early signs of improvement, we are working to optimize fulfillment of existing engagements, unleash our entrepreneur spirit and rejuvenate the growth mindset. Switching gears for a moment, I would like to offer a few perspectives. On the long-term demand environment for technology services I believe we are in a golden era of technology and that software is the new alchemy for every business and industry. As the world prepares for a post-pandemic reset of the way we work and live our lives, we see more organizations accelerating their embrace of digital technologies. Industry is at lower levels of digital maturity like health care, life sciences and manufacturing are stepping up their tech intensity. While those that are more digitally mature like financial services, retail and communications are staying invested in digitizing the landscapes. We also interestingly see workplaces rapidly adapt digital technologies as employees get comfortable with continuously toggling between hybrid and physical workplaces. In an era of globalization that has spanned several decades, enterprises have turned to tech services companies to enable their businesses to scale and globalize. Today, every industry is a tech industry. Technology will be deeply embedded in the core of every business, every product and every service. Therefore, the use of deep software engineering capabilities to transform the core of businesses will be a big player for tech services firms like Cognizant. So too will be the market opportunity that comes from born-digital companies that outsource the technology core and operations. The cloud, needless to say, will continue to remain the biggest general purpose technology we have seen in decades, and be deeply embedded as a digital pillar in every business. Cloud migration, modernization, application services will continue to create significant market momentum. Growth will also be driven by new cloud services like data on the cloud, data exchanges, new SaaS services and cloud security services. Clients are aware of our deep alliances with the hyperscalers and new best-in-class SaaS companies as well as our ability to co-innovate with these partners. We truly believe clients will continue to turn to us to help orchestrate those cloud capabilities. The shift to the cloud and 5G have also accelerated IoT adoption as use cases grow with better connectivity and proliferating devices and that's core. Last week, we further bolstered our IoT embedded software engineering capabilities with our agreement to acquire Mobica, an IoT software engineering provider. Mobica also strengthens our near-shoring capabilities in Eastern Europe, which is home to nearly 8,000 of our associates. We see a strong push now to bring AI into business landscape with the expectation that AI will reengineer enterprises as completely as enterprise software did three decades ago. Of course, as clients navigate a challenging macro environment now, they need to fund their investments in digital transformation by executing cost and efficiency agendas. These same clients are now asking how we can help them achieve their cost reduction ambitions and underwrite savings for their digital initiatives. Given our broad capabilities, we can help clients, whether they need to drive efficiency gains, innovation or an end-to-end transformation of the business. I quickly want to turn for a moment to India, home to about three quarters of Cognizant's workforce. India is likely to be the world's technology talent hub for the next decade. India's population has a demographic profile and digital talent pool unmatched by any other country. And NASSCOM forecasts some two million IT professionals will be added to India's talent pool over the next three years. We'll continue to capitalize on this surge in the IT talent in India as we intensify efforts to recruit from India's Tier 2 cities as well. Our large associate base in India is an ongoing source of strength and differentiation for Cognizant and one in which we will continue to invest. As confident as I am in Cognizant's prospects, I'm fully aware, as we have signaled with our guidance for Q1, for quarter one, that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline and go after larger opportunities. Please know we put a lot of thought into our decision to hold off on providing full year guidance. But before making commitments I can stand behind, I really need to spend more time digging into the business and talking to associates and clients. Keep in mind that we are building on a strong foundation. We have a long-standing client relationships, a broad portfolio of industry-specific solutions, a robust and resilient global delivery network, a significant opportunity for international expansion and most important, a reenergized and highly motivated team. I intend to catalyze Cognizant's heritage culture of bold ambitions, our entrepreneur spirit that emphasizes being fast, agile and adaptable and of course, our camaraderie and teamwork. I'm super energized to lead Cognizant into the next era of growth, and I'll put everything I have into making this happen. As I've shared with all our associates, our mantra right now is to bring back growth and be the employer of choice. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the financial details of the quarter before we take over questions. Jan, over to you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Ravi. And good evening, everyone. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 revenue were above the high end of the guidance range we provided on our third quarter earnings call in November and in line with the revised expectations we provided on January 12. Operating margin was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed noncash charge in the quarter, which I will cover in more detail later. [Indiscernible] of this charge, we were pleased with the continued progress towards our operating margin goals driven by commercial discipline, the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage. During the quarter, we made progress improving fulfillment, driven in part by a meaningful reduction in voluntary attrition, which declined to 19% on a quarterly annualized basis from 29% last quarter. This has allowed us to further decrease subcontracted usage and will enable us to put greater focus on driving improved commercial momentum in the quarters ahead. That said, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we continue to see pockets of weakness across several key verticals. Now moving on to the details for the quarter, fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 1.3% year-over-year or 4.1% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of 2022. Full year 2022 revenue was $19.4 billion, representing an increase of 5% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. In Q4, digital revenue grew 4% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. This resulted in full year 2022 digital revenue growth of 11% or 13% in constant currency. Digital mix was unchanged from last quarter at 51%, up two points from the prior year period. Q4 bookings increased 12% year-over-year, including the large agreement with CoreLogic that we announced last week. This opportunity is primarily a renewal of existing work with some modest increase in scope during the latter years of the contract. For the full year, we recorded bookings of $24.1 billion and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times, unchanged from the trailing 12-month book-to-bill we reported last quarter. Outside the large renewal, bookings momentum remains muted exiting this year. This has put pressure on our Q1 outlook, which I will cover shortly. Moving on now to segment results in the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1% reflecting a negative impact of 180 basis points related to the previously disclosed sale of our Samlink subsidiary. This was partially offset by growth among public sector clients in the UK and insurance clients. The revenue weakness is being driven by our banking and financial services practice, which we expect will remain under pressure for the next several quarters. Ravi, the entire team and I are laser-focused on reevaluating our go-to-market strategy, enhancing the strength of this portfolio and have initiated a series of actions, including certain leadership changes, that we believe will give us the best opportunity to improve our performance. We are seeing early signs of success with select global banking relationships where we have successfully shifted our portfolio mix towards higher growth in strategic areas. This gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction. However, more meaningful improvements will take time to implement. Health Services revenue grew 5%, consistent with last quarter. We experienced similar growth among both Healthcare and Life Sciences clients, which partially reflects some normalization of demand that had been driven by COVID. As we discussed last quarter, we have seen some pockets of softness within the segment, driven by the macro environment and regulatory complexity. Despite these challenges, we continue to review our Health Sciences capability as industry-leading and remain excited about the growth opportunities over the medium term. Products and Resources revenue grew 7%, a modest deceleration from last quarter. Revenue was negatively impacted by slower growth among manufacturing, retail and consumer goods customers, which we believe primarily, reflected the softening of the macro environment. This was offset by continued strength among consumer goods, automotive, logistics and utility customers. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 9%. Growth again was led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has driven growth in our core portfolio. Our growth has moderated somewhat as growth among some of our largest clients have slowed, but remains positive. We are closely monitoring trends and developments affecting the tech industry. Continuing with year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q4. North American revenue grew 3%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 8%. It also included a negative 220 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 16% and included double-digit growth in Financial Services including public sector clients. Now moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.2% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margins declined by 110 basis points. This includes the previously disclosed negative 120 basis point impact from a noncash impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer. Our operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivery efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, which represented an approximate 110 basis point benefit net of hedges year-over-year. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 27%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.02 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.01, down 7% and 8%, respectively. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were each negatively impacted by $0.08 in connection with the impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with the Health Sciences customer. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.9 billion. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by five days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q4 was $612 million, representing approximately 115% of net income. This brings full year free cash flow to $2.2 billion, representing approximately 100% of net income, in line with our expectations. We are pleased with our performance in 2022. However, a change in U.S. tax law that became effective last year now requires companies to capitalize rather than currently deduct R&D expenses. As a result, like many other companies, this will impact our free cash flow in 2023. We expect capitalization of R&D costs for tax purposes to negatively impact free cash flow by $600 million, which includes deferred payments for the 2022 tax year as well as increased payments for 2023. With this change, we expect our cash conversion ratio to be below our target of 100% of net income in 2023. Moving on to capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $139 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to $2 billion for the full year. In the quarter, we also completed two acquisitions: Austin CSI and Utegration for a total purchase price of approximately $370 million. In addition, we announced the acquisitions of Mobica and the professional services and management practices of OneSource Virtual. These acquisitions are expected to improve our digital revenue mix, enhance our consulting capabilities. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Over the longer term, we continue to expect to deploy a balanced capital allocation policy, returning to an aggregate of approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in form of dividends and share repurchases and allocating the remaining 50% to inorganic investments. Turning to our forward outlook. As Ravi mentioned, and you will see in our earnings materials, we are only providing revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Given our bookings momentum in 2022 and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect our full year 2023 performance to be below the multiyear goals we provided in late 2021. We intend to provide an update on the full year 2023 expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin next quarter. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.71 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2.5% to minus 1.5% or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 150 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We look forward to sharing more as Ravi continues to get up to speed. As he discussed, we remain very excited about the medium-term market opportunity. We also believe that while the current macroeconomic uncertainty has led to some pockets of slowdown, it also presents an opportunity for Cognizant to help our clients operate more efficiently while continuing to invest in new digital capabilities. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and congratulations and welcome Ravi and Steve as well, congratulations to you. It\u2019s good to reconnect. I think my first question is growth mindset, I get that, what are some of the explicit steps you might need to take incrementally to return to that growth mindset, if you can speak to your early view on what\u2019s needed for sales investments, capability investments, just the G&A investment to chase large contract, things like that?\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Ashwin, for that question. Good to connect with you. Having spent a significant time in this industry. I would say to build a growth mindset. There are a number of things we need to do. But I would probably highlight three of them as I talked to today, the most important priorities. First and foremost, Cognizant has to be an employer of choice in this industry. What I mean by that is spending time in the IT industry, IT service industry, what I mean by that is, you create a self-reinforcing cycle with employees and clients. Sustained success is based on quality, dedication and scale of the talent, but client experience and employee experience are so tightly linked. We have the opportunity to build a self-reinforcing cycle with engaged talent with a passion for clients and the growth mindset, which attracts the best clients. So that whole flywheel has to be self-reinforcing. It means a lot of things, all the way from retention to upscaling to leadership development to infusing the project and program leaders. Remember, we are a company of projects and programs, which essentially means as they walk the corridors, they mine our clients, these project leaders. And equally, they talk to our associates every day. So that is a starting point of where you try to build a trust with that player and continue to create that self-reinforcing virtual [ph] cycle does they call it. I think you talked about large deals. I think large deals has investments on both sides, investments on dealmakers, deal influencers, ability to create that momentum by supporting our client initiatives in various transformational initiatives of theirs. But equally, at the back end, you have to start to work on solutioning capabilities and the ability to build a continuum all the way from addressing cost takeout initiatives to manage services initiatives to large deals will come with people take over opportunities. And of course, productivity improvements. So there\u2019s a lot of tooling and infrastructure. I think Cognizant already has some of it, you have to build on it, and then go behind this opportunity. It\u2019s equally important that we build operational discipline, which also helps us to create the growth mindset all the way from fulfilling those deals to building market competitiveness on cost takeout initiatives to contract life cycle and risk management to consortium like deals and partnerships and a whole bunch of things. Well, do we have all of this in place? Yes. I think a lot of these things have already been set and I would say in the last few years at Cognizant. I have to orient this to a growth mindset and start to double down on the opportunities, which are there in the market. In the short run, some of this will mean additional investments, but in the medium to long run, you have to create that pool of investments inside by taking out costs so that you can then sustain that momentum for the future.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Thank you for the obvious thought you put into that answer. The second question is on the health care contract that was a problem in the quarter. Any granularity on sort of separating out the top and bottom line impact? And is it link-fenced now? In other words, at least the margin impact taking into account entirely in 4Q? Or is there a forward-looking impact? What\u2019s the forward-looking revenue impact as well?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Maybe I'll take this. The Health Sciences clients that we have is a volume-based contract-based on the performance of that healthcare client. And so as the outlook of our client has changed, we had to adjust our revenue expectations going forward, which led then to a charge that we had to take for the expected lower volumes of incoming business to us in essence. And so the revenue impact is really going to be baked into our natural revenue guidance and forecast. So the charge that we have been taking is a discrete charge of $60 million. And that is a non-cash charge of prior capitalized implementation costs that we are now taken out of the contract. So future volume changes of this client could impact our calculation on these capitalized implementation costs as well. So there's still outlook. We obviously work very hard with our clients to drive great revenue growth as our interest and the clients' interest, but there is still a possibility of depending on the revenue development and the market performance of the client that we could be impacted in the future as well.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey thanks so much guys. Steve, nice to hear from you upfront. It's been a while. So I want to ask similar to Ashwin to Ravi here, just the goal of being the employer of choice and having a growth mindset makes a lot of sense. How long do you think it would take for \u2013 to change the culture to get to that level? I'm imagining it can't be a quick fix, but maybe you feel differently?\nRavi Kumar: Yes, that's a good question. I'm just three weeks into the job, so I'm continuing to assess what we have, what we need to do. It's a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle. As I said, as much as it looks easy, it's \u2013 if you're on it it's easy, if you're not on it it's not. I'm going to be on a listening tour for the next few weeks and months, meeting clients, meeting associates, meeting partners and I'll come back with assessment. I think we have built enough both on client and employee infrastructure \u2013 organizational infrastructure. Now I have to refine it and reset it for growth; that's how I see it. I want to build on it. We're not going to go back to the drawing board. We want to build on what we have and refine it, and as we refine it, we'll make some changes and get there. With related to employees, a lot of our \u2013 two-thirds of our employees work out of India. So India is an integral part of our strategy to differentiate and I'm going to spend the next few weeks in India as well, later part of February. And I'm meeting 100 clients in 100 days, and this is a goal which I've set for my own self, so that you get to know the pulse, you get stay focused on large deals. In fact, I'm doing a monitoring of 10 large deals every week, and we are continuing to keep the focus on commercial momentum. So it's in flight transformation, as I call it. We'll continue to do this, but we will continue to look for the medium- to long-term sustained momentum, how you create it. That's how I see it. It's still a question I will probably like to answer once I spend a few more weeks going through the listening part.\nJan Siegmund: Maybe I'll give Ravi also a tiny breather here and talk about the improved attrition, which is certainly one. First step into the right direction of becoming a more attractive employer and seeing it reflected. So clearly the dynamic in the labor markets have shifted also, but we also believe that the investments that we have made not only in regular and competitive merit cycles. You may remember we announced in the last quarter that we had accelerated our \u2013 this year's merit cycle to the second quarter, which is also important for the modeling of you guys into the second quarter. And that we have made huge progress on internal promotions, career pathing and learning and development and education, et cetera, as we have increased the number of our college graduates into our permit. So I think we have seen now a year of this permit from a nuts and bolts piece to stabilize, and we were very pleased with this relatively steep drop in nutrition in just one quarter. So we feel we are off to a good start here and then I think Ravi is focus on management, on enthusiasm, on growth and aligning will help. And then we'll kind of continue to refine those investments as we \u2013 as we need it. But I think we have already ended the year actually on that side with a big step forward.\nRavi Kumar: And also the talent supply chain, we've been able to streamline it, strengthen it, and be ready for fulfillment and opportunities, which our clients are looking forward to.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Then if it's okay, if I can ask my follow-up then with \u2013 given that 10-point drop in attrition and you've still hired a little bit, the utilization rates did drop. So from a modeling perspective, not to bore people, but anything to guide us to in the short-term on some of those KPIs because they are moving quite a bit here?\nJan Siegmund: We're obviously on this utilization metric also a very detailed answer. In this quarter, the slight decrease in utilization is actually more driven by the relative higher percentage of Gen Z hires into our pyramid, which are not as utilized in the young age and actually a return to normalized location taking compared to the COVID years of where we had abnormally low vacation period. So those were the biggest factors. So I wouldn't model too much into the utilization. Obviously, we need to drive growth and as we now have better fulfillment opportunities. But in this quarter, actually, some of the utilization, both were the 2 biggest factors, Tien-Tsin.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Perfect. Thank you Jan and Ravi. Appreciate that and look forward to get to the updates and safe and healthy travels. Thanks.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I want to follow-up a little bit on Tien-Tsin's question as well as Jan and Ravi's comment is. If we look at Ravi, your initial stages of evaluating and listening to customers and what you're seeing in the business? And if I put that together with Jan's comments around investment that seems to be helping in attrition, et cetera. I'm wondering if the two of you can give some perspective on if there's anything that stands out right now as maybe points or places where there could have been under investment that you'd like to direct resources, and how does that impact the way that you're thinking about \u2013 you and the Board are thinking about the right objectives from a cost and profitability standpoint?\nJan Siegmund: Ravi will chime in after I give you a more technical thing. I think as we mostly developing these plans, so we're clearly not at the end of the job, otherwise, we would give guidance today. But when you think large deals and calculate [indiscernible] of volume, I think deal characteristics of large deals have impact us on to our margin profile. And when we think about that, we need to build kind of our culture to leverage the relative margin strength if you exclude our health care charge and our pricing discipline and our delivery discipline, so that it allows us to be competitive for these larger deals that may cause dilution initially and then ramp up their full margin potential.\nJames Faucette: So I think the biggest impact practically would be to figure out for us, assuming the success in our large deal focus of what that would mean for the overall P&L structure. I think that's going to be the biggest one. There's going to be other investments that Ravi is going is going to be proposing, but I think we're going to be managing those a little bit more within the framework of an SG&A volume that we have already not to take that away from you, Ravi, but I think...\nRavi Kumar: Jan, I think you've covered it so nicely. The one thing I would probably add is, I think in the last one to two years, Cognizant has invested heavily on organizational infrastructure to take large deals on a continuum, all the way from managed services to transaction-based pricing to cost takeout initiatives to digital transformation on that continuum. Now is the time to leverage those investments and take those large deals and be competitive on those large deals. So in a way, I would say a large part of it is done. We have now strengthened it, and we have oriented to the market for the opportunity, which is going to be presented to us. So that's broadly how I see it. As I keep saying, it isn't going back to the drawing board, but I'm going to build on what we have. We're going to refine it. As we refine it, we have to make some changes. We're going to make those changes, but we'll be agile enough in the market to seize the opportunities we have.\nJames Faucette: Appreciate that. And then just as a follow-up, Ravi, how are you thinking about and what's your perception of the current economic environment? Obviously, as you go to listen and engage with customers, et cetera. It seems like a big part of the challenge for you will be to parse out feedback that is specific to Cognizant and has impact on how you should move the business going forward on a sustained basis versus maybe some things that are happening near-term. So just wanted to hear how you're thinking about the current economic environment and the lens that you're looking at, at some of these comments or listening to these \u2013 some of these comments through?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. That's a good question, and I'm going to leave it to Jan as well to chime in. Over the years, IT Services has gone from a homogeneous landscape to a heterogeneous landscape, they're different swim lanes. In an uncertain economic environment, if you're going to see discrete study spend being a little softer. Large digital transformation engagements will start to become moderate in nature. But equally, you're going to see cost takeout initiatives, vendor consolidation initiatives happening on the other hand, I would say that's a different swim lane. But enterprises are continuing to invest because not only are they investing on the consumer side of digital. We're also investing on the employee side of digital because employees today are interacting with their organizations on a digital platform because of the hybridness of how work and what places are.  So I would say it's a duality of sorts. On one side, you would see softness. On the other side, you would see cost takeout and vendor consolidation kind of happening. Depending on the industry you look for, there are industries which have lesser tech and digital intensity and the industries which have higher tech and digital intensity. And some of them are using the digital platform to transform and deliver.  In fact, I would say, digital technologies is almost like a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. So some of our clients are using digital technologies to do so. So it's a mixed bag. It's \u2013 because of the heterogeneity, I would say it's a mixed bag; each swim lane has its own characteristics. Jan, do you want to chime in?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Like I'll give you a little bit more background maybe about our bookings performance and what \u2013 where we have seen the softness and geographically and by digital. We actually did have a relatively solid bookings growth in digital this last year, and I'm giving you full year numbers. It's about I'm doing to 16%,18% or something growth in the digital bookings world. And then we saw actually the weakness by sector really concentrated, as you would expect in our Financial Services Group, where we saw the biggest decline in bookings volume for us.  And as Ravi illustrated in his comments, it's kind of almost in every industry where we're trying to sort out, are we having some industries stronger and others, but we do have success stories by industry sector, and we have declines in industry. So it seems to be a little bit client specific of what we need to watch out. You have talked obviously, now looking forward; we entered the year with one of our largest pipelines ever, basically.  And now a lot of work, which is for Ravi and the market teams to achieve, is to convert that pipeline into qualifications and into bookings numbers. So there seems to be a lot of opportunity still out in the thing. Obviously, the mix of that business is shifting a little bit. We hope we want to drive a higher participation and higher bookings number for larger deals, which we haven't had in the past, and that's the true revenue \u2013 incremental revenue opportunity that we're aiming to capture.  And but there is still a very solid market out there. Even though the demand on a sequential basis has gotten a little bit softer, if that makes some sense. So we're going to be laser focused, obviously on converting this opportunity into bookings and then to revenues. But the underlying market remains attractive from my perspective. \nJames Faucette: That's great. Thanks for the color of Ravi and Jan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Togut: Thanks so much. Congratulations, Ravi and Steve, it's really good to hear your voice again. Could you, Jan, give us some guardrails around gross margins in 2023? Not looking for anything precise, but maybe just help us think through some of the headwinds and tailwinds. You had a number of wage increases in 2022. Obviously, attrition coming down helps a little bit, but could you help us think about, what the gross margin range might be this year?\nJan Siegmund: Well, that I cannot do. But I think I can give you a few, David. Good to hear your words as well. And I give you a few pointers that I think are kind of important for the modeling that we had prior disclosed. So the usual merit increase that puts negative pressure on our gross margin in the fourth quarter will now occur in the second quarter. So that will disturb a little bit our pattern of regular margin development throughout the year. If anything, I think, that second and third quarter traditionally our strongest margin patterns, and then we have the fourth quarter due to the marathon this will shift a little bit. But other than that, we are not really thinking that the general dynamic of our pattern of the year is going to shift in a very meaningful way. So I think it's like even our past performance, there's no guarantee for future performance. But like when I think about our year, I think that the principal dynamics remain unchanged. We have seen \u2013 maybe at this one point I'm getting into 12 years I look at Tyler, but we have seen actually moderate to good success with our pricing initiatives.  And so the contribution of our pricing initiative to gross margin in the fourth quarter was the highest. So we have really built quarter-after-quarter momentum, and it was 50% higher than all other quarters together. And so we're entering with a little bit of pricing momentum, and then we have \u2013 that's going to be partially offset or offset by our wage increases in the second quarter. And then, as you said, coming up with some sort of metric, which of how attrition is going to help us in revenue or fulfillment and some efficiencies is going to be then for the modeling.  That's what we also undergo right now, David. So I really don't have those numbers yet for you, and we're planning to do the update in the second quarter then. \nDavid Togut: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey guys thanks for taking my call. Congrats to Steve and Ravi. Ravi, maybe just to start with you. I know you obviously need time to study the organization, develop your plan. But just at a high level, is your initial sense that Cognizant has more room to improve in terms of strategy or in terms of execution?\nRavi Kumar: I think it's how I will see it. And of course, I need more time to assess, as I said, it's listening to with both clients and my associates. But the way I see it is the opportunity ahead of us. I think we have an extraordinary set of client relationships, extraordinary talent pool. Looking from outside, I've always been impressed by the entrepreneurs spirit, the bold ambitions and some very good teamwork at Cognizant.  The one trend I've always been excited about at Cognizant is the confluence of industry vertical experience with technology expertise, a very unique spot. It's a very, very unique spot. So I could almost see this as a way forward strength and look for opportunities, which will fit the bill. And I do believe that we have been necessary organizational infrastructure to attract employees, retail employees, attract clients, retail clients and also win large deals.  That is how I see it. The opportunity in front of us is what I'm kind of configuring and calibrating the firm to instead of actually looking back and looking forward and trying to gear up for that opportunity with what we have and what we need to build. So that's broadly what I can say. How I'm actually trying to approach my way forward direction. \nJason Kupferberg: Very helpful. And just as a follow-up, this might be more for Jan. But how close are we do you think to fully remediating the fulfillment issues? And then just any at least directional commentary you can give us on first quarter operating margins? Thanks guys. \nJan Siegmund: Yes. The fulfillment in the fourth quarter really improved very meaningfully. And it gives us part, I think, is part of the optimism we have that we can go to clients and fulfill their needs, which as we have talked in the third and fourth quarter. In the third quarter was hampered at times by our resource constraints. So I think the improvement in fulfillment will translate into accelerated and enhanced sales activity. That's at least part of our thesis that we have. And it should obviously lower our need for recruiting and have efficiencies and the support for all of this will make clients happier and so forth.  So the underlying engine running a smoother is really a shift compared to where we were throughout last fiscal year. So I think that's really \u2013 that gives us hope and gives us optimism for it. Yes, we're not giving a first quarter margins, unfortunately, so I can't help you with any direction there. \nRavi Kumar: Yes. So just to add to what Jan said, I think my initial few weeks, one of the observations is I think our talent supply chain is grinding well or it's kind of moving very, very well. Some of the clients I've spoken to in the last few weeks have started to tell us that we can start to get some of the demand moved to Cognizant with the fulfillment starting to look good.  So I'm actually very excited about the progress we've made on fulfillment. I think we are ready to take more, and we're ready to continuously sharpen the talent supply chain for the opportunity with our clients. Our clients are starting to see that traction with us. \nJason Kupferberg: Thanks for the comments.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. \nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to catching up with you in a couple of months on our first quarter earnings call. \nJan Siegmund: Thank you. \nSteve Rohleder: Thank you. \nRavi Kumar: Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Steve Rohleder",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and thank you all for joining us today. Given the recent news, I wanted to join the call for this quarter to introduce myself and explain the changes we've recently announced. For those of you that don't know me, I'm Steve Rohleder, and I joined the Board as an Independent Director in March of 2022. Last month, I became Chair of Cognizant's Board of Directors. I previously spent 35 years at Accenture, where I served as Group Chief Executive of Health and Public Services, Chief Executive of North America and Chief Operating Officer. Today, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent CEO transition and the Board changes announced this afternoon supporting our ongoing Board refreshment process. I also want to explain why we're excited for Cognizant's next chapter. Ravi will then introduce himself and share his thoughts before Jan discusses our fourth quarter results in detail. We'll then proceed to Q&A. Regarding our CEO transition, as we announced a few weeks ago, the Board appointed Ravi Kumar to succeed Brian Humphries as CEO. Brian was a resilient leader providing a steady hand as he steered the company through various challenges, including the global pandemic. On behalf of the Board, management and all of our associates, I want to thank Brian for his contributions, which have helped to position Cognizant to capture a large growing market and fuel profitable revenue growth beyond our short-term challenges. We also appreciate that Brian will remain with the company as a special adviser until March to ensure a seamless transition. As part of the Board's strategy to help Cognizant achieve long-term sustainable growth, we also announced today a new Board appointment. Eric Branderiz, a proven financial executive and public company director with demonstrated experience supporting growth in technology and in the energy industries, has been appointed to serve as an Independent Director on the Board. Eric brings significant experience in finance, accounting, M&A execution, risk management and ESG and corporate governance to Cognizant, and we welcome him to the Board. The appointment comes as our Board continues to strive towards optimizing its balance of director skills and tenures as part of its ongoing refreshment program. With Eric's appointment, the Board has appointed five new independent directors over the last four years. Maureen Breakiron-Evans, a member of the Board since 2009, has also advised the Board that she will not stand for reelection at Cognizant's 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On behalf of the entire Board, we thank her for her more than a decade of astute guidance, exceptional leadership and dedicated service to Cognizant. Given these changes to the Board, our Governance Committee, our committee chairs and myself will perform a comprehensive evaluation of committee composition with an aim toward balancing representation of Board tenure and appropriate key skills and qualifications on our committees. These were topics that I, along with other members of the Board, had the pleasure of discussing with several of our largest investors during our annual governance road show in the fourth quarter. Now before I turn the call over to Ravi, let me share a little bit about our enthusiasm for his leadership. Over the past few years, Cognizant has navigated a dynamic uncertain market while strengthening its operational and financial fundamentals. Heading into 2023, the Board believes that Cognizant has established a solid operational foundation and now needs to move toward accelerating growth. This agenda requires a focused growth mindset driven from the C-Suite. Ravi has this mindset. He brings a passion for building teams and driving growth in our industry, and we're confident that he is the right leader to take Cognizant into our next phase with a goal of ultimately delivering significant returns to our shareholders. Ravi also brings to Cognizant best-in-class operations, transformation and leadership expertise at a global scale from a stellar 20-year track record of emphasis. During his tenure, he oversaw the company's global services organization and drove growth across its global industry segments. Ravi is a proven strategist who secured significant IT services deals. He led international business operations in India, Latin America, Japan and China, and he pioneered the creation of digital talent pools in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Importantly, during his time at Infosys, Ravi earned a reputation as a people-focused leader with a deep rooted commitment to teams and associates. Since he joined us a few weeks ago, Ravi has proven out this reputation as Cognizant associates have warmly welcomed into the team and are deeply enthusiastic about his leadership. We're confident that Ravi will help us further our efforts to support engagement and trust internally and drive retention amongst our high-performing leaders and associates. As we look forward under Ravi's leadership, Cognizant will have a sharp focus on two key priorities. First, we'll be focused on meaningful acceleration of revenue growth. Our second key priority will be ensuring that Cognizant is the employer of choice in our industry. Ravi is the right leader to achieve this vision, and the Board looks forward to partnering with him. I'll now turn the call over to Ravi to introduce himself and to share some additional perspective. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Ravi. And good evening, everyone. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 revenue were above the high end of the guidance range we provided on our third quarter earnings call in November and in line with the revised expectations we provided on January 12. Operating margin was negatively impacted by the previously disclosed noncash charge in the quarter, which I will cover in more detail later. [Indiscernible] of this charge, we were pleased with the continued progress towards our operating margin goals driven by commercial discipline, the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage. During the quarter, we made progress improving fulfillment, driven in part by a meaningful reduction in voluntary attrition, which declined to 19% on a quarterly annualized basis from 29% last quarter. This has allowed us to further decrease subcontracted usage and will enable us to put greater focus on driving improved commercial momentum in the quarters ahead. That said, the macro environment remains uncertain, and we continue to see pockets of weakness across several key verticals. Now moving on to the details for the quarter, fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 1.3% year-over-year or 4.1% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of 2022. Full year 2022 revenue was $19.4 billion, representing an increase of 5% year-over-year or 7.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. In Q4, digital revenue grew 4% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. This resulted in full year 2022 digital revenue growth of 11% or 13% in constant currency. Digital mix was unchanged from last quarter at 51%, up two points from the prior year period. Q4 bookings increased 12% year-over-year, including the large agreement with CoreLogic that we announced last week. This opportunity is primarily a renewal of existing work with some modest increase in scope during the latter years of the contract. For the full year, we recorded bookings of $24.1 billion and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 times, unchanged from the trailing 12-month book-to-bill we reported last quarter. Outside the large renewal, bookings momentum remains muted exiting this year. This has put pressure on our Q1 outlook, which I will cover shortly. Moving on now to segment results in the fourth quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1% reflecting a negative impact of 180 basis points related to the previously disclosed sale of our Samlink subsidiary. This was partially offset by growth among public sector clients in the UK and insurance clients. The revenue weakness is being driven by our banking and financial services practice, which we expect will remain under pressure for the next several quarters. Ravi, the entire team and I are laser-focused on reevaluating our go-to-market strategy, enhancing the strength of this portfolio and have initiated a series of actions, including certain leadership changes, that we believe will give us the best opportunity to improve our performance. We are seeing early signs of success with select global banking relationships where we have successfully shifted our portfolio mix towards higher growth in strategic areas. This gives us confidence that we are moving in the right direction. However, more meaningful improvements will take time to implement. Health Services revenue grew 5%, consistent with last quarter. We experienced similar growth among both Healthcare and Life Sciences clients, which partially reflects some normalization of demand that had been driven by COVID. As we discussed last quarter, we have seen some pockets of softness within the segment, driven by the macro environment and regulatory complexity. Despite these challenges, we continue to review our Health Sciences capability as industry-leading and remain excited about the growth opportunities over the medium term. Products and Resources revenue grew 7%, a modest deceleration from last quarter. Revenue was negatively impacted by slower growth among manufacturing, retail and consumer goods customers, which we believe primarily, reflected the softening of the macro environment. This was offset by continued strength among consumer goods, automotive, logistics and utility customers. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 9%. Growth again was led by our technology business, where our work with digital-native clients has driven growth in our core portfolio. Our growth has moderated somewhat as growth among some of our largest clients have slowed, but remains positive. We are closely monitoring trends and developments affecting the tech industry. Continuing with year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q4. North American revenue grew 3%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 8%. It also included a negative 220 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 16% and included double-digit growth in Financial Services including public sector clients. Now moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.2% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margins declined by 110 basis points. This includes the previously disclosed negative 120 basis point impact from a noncash impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with a Health Sciences customer. Our operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivery efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, which represented an approximate 110 basis point benefit net of hedges year-over-year. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 27%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.02 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.01, down 7% and 8%, respectively. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share were each negatively impacted by $0.08 in connection with the impairment of capitalized costs related to a large volume-based contract with the Health Sciences customer. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.9 billion. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by five days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q4 was $612 million, representing approximately 115% of net income. This brings full year free cash flow to $2.2 billion, representing approximately 100% of net income, in line with our expectations. We are pleased with our performance in 2022. However, a change in U.S. tax law that became effective last year now requires companies to capitalize rather than currently deduct R&D expenses. As a result, like many other companies, this will impact our free cash flow in 2023. We expect capitalization of R&D costs for tax purposes to negatively impact free cash flow by $600 million, which includes deferred payments for the 2022 tax year as well as increased payments for 2023. With this change, we expect our cash conversion ratio to be below our target of 100% of net income in 2023. Moving on to capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $139 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to $2 billion for the full year. In the quarter, we also completed two acquisitions: Austin CSI and Utegration for a total purchase price of approximately $370 million. In addition, we announced the acquisitions of Mobica and the professional services and management practices of OneSource Virtual. These acquisitions are expected to improve our digital revenue mix, enhance our consulting capabilities. Our capital allocation framework remains unchanged. Over the longer term, we continue to expect to deploy a balanced capital allocation policy, returning to an aggregate of approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in form of dividends and share repurchases and allocating the remaining 50% to inorganic investments. Turning to our forward outlook. As Ravi mentioned, and you will see in our earnings materials, we are only providing revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2023. Given our bookings momentum in 2022 and the uncertain macroeconomic environment, we expect our full year 2023 performance to be below the multiyear goals we provided in late 2021. We intend to provide an update on the full year 2023 expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin next quarter. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.71 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2.5% to minus 1.5% or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 150 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We look forward to sharing more as Ravi continues to get up to speed. As he discussed, we remain very excited about the medium-term market opportunity. We also believe that while the current macroeconomic uncertainty has led to some pockets of slowdown, it also presents an opportunity for Cognizant to help our clients operate more efficiently while continuing to invest in new digital capabilities. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. Maybe I'll take this. The Health Sciences clients that we have is a volume-based contract-based on the performance of that healthcare client. And so as the outlook of our client has changed, we had to adjust our revenue expectations going forward, which led then to a charge that we had to take for the expected lower volumes of incoming business to us in essence. And so the revenue impact is really going to be baked into our natural revenue guidance and forecast. So the charge that we have been taking is a discrete charge of $60 million. And that is a non-cash charge of prior capitalized implementation costs that we are now taken out of the contract. So future volume changes of this client could impact our calculation on these capitalized implementation costs as well. So there's still outlook. We obviously work very hard with our clients to drive great revenue growth as our interest and the clients' interest, but there is still a possibility of depending on the revenue development and the market performance of the client that we could be impacted in the future as well. Maybe I'll give Ravi also a tiny breather here and talk about the improved attrition, which is certainly one. First step into the right direction of becoming a more attractive employer and seeing it reflected. So clearly the dynamic in the labor markets have shifted also, but we also believe that the investments that we have made not only in regular and competitive merit cycles. You may remember we announced in the last quarter that we had accelerated our \u2013 this year's merit cycle to the second quarter, which is also important for the modeling of you guys into the second quarter. And that we have made huge progress on internal promotions, career pathing and learning and development and education, et cetera, as we have increased the number of our college graduates into our permit. So I think we have seen now a year of this permit from a nuts and bolts piece to stabilize, and we were very pleased with this relatively steep drop in nutrition in just one quarter. So we feel we are off to a good start here and then I think Ravi is focus on management, on enthusiasm, on growth and aligning will help. And then we'll kind of continue to refine those investments as we \u2013 as we need it. But I think we have already ended the year actually on that side with a big step forward. We're obviously on this utilization metric also a very detailed answer. In this quarter, the slight decrease in utilization is actually more driven by the relative higher percentage of Gen Z hires into our pyramid, which are not as utilized in the young age and actually a return to normalized location taking compared to the COVID years of where we had abnormally low vacation period. So those were the biggest factors. So I wouldn't model too much into the utilization. Obviously, we need to drive growth and as we now have better fulfillment opportunities. But in this quarter, actually, some of the utilization, both were the 2 biggest factors, Tien-Tsin. Ravi will chime in after I give you a more technical thing. I think as we mostly developing these plans, so we're clearly not at the end of the job, otherwise, we would give guidance today. But when you think large deals and calculate [indiscernible] of volume, I think deal characteristics of large deals have impact us on to our margin profile. And when we think about that, we need to build kind of our culture to leverage the relative margin strength if you exclude our health care charge and our pricing discipline and our delivery discipline, so that it allows us to be competitive for these larger deals that may cause dilution initially and then ramp up their full margin potential. Yes. Like I'll give you a little bit more background maybe about our bookings performance and what \u2013 where we have seen the softness and geographically and by digital. We actually did have a relatively solid bookings growth in digital this last year, and I'm giving you full year numbers. It's about I'm doing to 16%,18% or something growth in the digital bookings world. And then we saw actually the weakness by sector really concentrated, as you would expect in our Financial Services Group, where we saw the biggest decline in bookings volume for us.  And as Ravi illustrated in his comments, it's kind of almost in every industry where we're trying to sort out, are we having some industries stronger and others, but we do have success stories by industry sector, and we have declines in industry. So it seems to be a little bit client specific of what we need to watch out. You have talked obviously, now looking forward; we entered the year with one of our largest pipelines ever, basically.  And now a lot of work, which is for Ravi and the market teams to achieve, is to convert that pipeline into qualifications and into bookings numbers. So there seems to be a lot of opportunity still out in the thing. Obviously, the mix of that business is shifting a little bit. We hope we want to drive a higher participation and higher bookings number for larger deals, which we haven't had in the past, and that's the true revenue \u2013 incremental revenue opportunity that we're aiming to capture.  And but there is still a very solid market out there. Even though the demand on a sequential basis has gotten a little bit softer, if that makes some sense. So we're going to be laser focused, obviously on converting this opportunity into bookings and then to revenues. But the underlying market remains attractive from my perspective. Well, that I cannot do. But I think I can give you a few, David. Good to hear your words as well. And I give you a few pointers that I think are kind of important for the modeling that we had prior disclosed. So the usual merit increase that puts negative pressure on our gross margin in the fourth quarter will now occur in the second quarter. So that will disturb a little bit our pattern of regular margin development throughout the year. If anything, I think, that second and third quarter traditionally our strongest margin patterns, and then we have the fourth quarter due to the marathon this will shift a little bit. But other than that, we are not really thinking that the general dynamic of our pattern of the year is going to shift in a very meaningful way. So I think it's like even our past performance, there's no guarantee for future performance. But like when I think about our year, I think that the principal dynamics remain unchanged. We have seen \u2013 maybe at this one point I'm getting into 12 years I look at Tyler, but we have seen actually moderate to good success with our pricing initiatives.  And so the contribution of our pricing initiative to gross margin in the fourth quarter was the highest. So we have really built quarter-after-quarter momentum, and it was 50% higher than all other quarters together. And so we're entering with a little bit of pricing momentum, and then we have \u2013 that's going to be partially offset or offset by our wage increases in the second quarter. And then, as you said, coming up with some sort of metric, which of how attrition is going to help us in revenue or fulfillment and some efficiencies is going to be then for the modeling.  That's what we also undergo right now, David. So I really don't have those numbers yet for you, and we're planning to do the update in the second quarter then. Yes. The fulfillment in the fourth quarter really improved very meaningfully. And it gives us part, I think, is part of the optimism we have that we can go to clients and fulfill their needs, which as we have talked in the third and fourth quarter. In the third quarter was hampered at times by our resource constraints. So I think the improvement in fulfillment will translate into accelerated and enhanced sales activity. That's at least part of our thesis that we have. And it should obviously lower our need for recruiting and have efficiencies and the support for all of this will make clients happier and so forth.  So the underlying engine running a smoother is really a shift compared to where we were throughout last fiscal year. So I think that's really \u2013 that gives us hope and gives us optimism for it. Yes, we're not giving a first quarter margins, unfortunately, so I can't help you with any direction there. Thank you."

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, for that very warm introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. My appointment as CEO is one of the proudest moments of my life. I'm excited as well as humbled by this opportunity to lead Cognizant, a company I've long admired, closely watched and competed against. As I've experienced, Cognizant has a diverse, highly skilled and a fully engaged Board. I'm grateful for the Board's trust and support and for their efforts to lay the groundwork for me and the company to flourish. I'm also very grateful to my predecessor, Brian Humphries, who led the evolution of Cognizant's business. He refreshed and broadened the strategy, extended the company's portfolio and drove the implementation of more rigorous systems and processes. With a very strong foundation in place, I'm not going back to the drawing board. Instead, I plan to move forward by building on and refining what already exists, which will include calibrating a thinking to a growth mindset. I want to see us offer the full breadth of our industry-specific solutions, whether developed organically or acquired through targeted acquisitions to a large installed base of clients and investor growth. A few days after my appointment, I participated in Cognizant's annual sales kickoff, which was held in Abu Dhabi. At the summit, 1,000 of our client-facing associates came together from around the world to take stock of all of what we have and what we need to accelerate growth. I was so deeply moved by the warmth and the enthusiasm I was greeted with. We set ourselves a goal to be an employer of choice, which we believe will be a pivot for growth. I plan to spend the next several months meeting with so many associates, clients, partners and shareholders as much as I can. I will listen carefully with an open mind, build trust and learn all I can about how best to unlock more value for clients, make progress in accelerating top line growth and drive long-term shareholder value. Because I like to be highly visible with clients and associates, my plan is to meet with 100 clients over 100 days whether in person or virtually and to visit with as many of our global teams as I can. Later this quarter, I'm spending several weeks in India and visiting associates at many of our locations across the country. Having joined Cognizant just three weeks ago, I'm early in my learning curve and need time to get my hands on the pulse of the business. That said, I \u2013 while already identified several areas that are tied to operating with a growth mindset to focus on immediately. Today, I will look to talk about three of those important areas: first, making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; second, strengthening our ability to win large deals; and third, enhancing our operating discipline. A quick word on each starting with employer of choice. Spent time in the IT services industry, and you quickly realize that sustained success hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent. The value we create for clients comes from the knowledge of the skills of our associates. Because the client experience and the employee experience are so tightly linked, we have the opportunity to create a self-reinforcing cycle. Highly engaged client \u2013 talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. That's why one of our goals and one of my specific important roles as the CEO is creating conditions for all our associates to excel. I'm committed to investing heavily in providing associates with continuous learning, upscaling and leadership development, all aimed at increasing the professional relevance. I believe the number one factor that will define success for Cognizant is to become the employer of choice in our industry. Everything else must be based on that foundation, especially the ability to consistently deliver industry-leading growth, which is the absolute focus of the entire management team.  Let's turn to large deals, which are another top priority given how essential they are to building commercial momentum and enhancing our station as a provider of business outcomes aligned by industry. Accelerating large deal bookings that will align with our risk appetite requires the client centricity and competitive self-confidence to work the corridors of our clients, cultivating and mining existing relationships, while hunting for new ones and always showing up with an informed point of view. Over the last year or so, Cognizant business has advanced its solutioning capabilities along with its project and program management processes. We have become better equipped to solution and manage large deals and have planned to build on this foundation to reenergize our efforts. In particular, I want to instill a greater sense of pride and empowerment among our client partners and delivery teams to encourage a faster, more agile response to client needs. I have a weekly standing meeting during which I review 10 large deals and do everything I can to help our teams to drive these deals over the finish line. Last week, we were pleased to announce the signing of a 10-year $1 billion renewal contract with a long-standing client, CoreLogic, demonstrating our capabilities and the confidence our clients place in us. The third area of focus is ensuring operational excellence across the company, including our approach to large deals and fulfillment in general. We are building out an organizational structure designed to bring together a continuum of activities such as industrialized delivery with high productivity rates, market competitive cost takeout initiatives, contract life cycle and risk management, consortium led deals and more. As one Cognizant team, we are also working on internal simplification as a team. We will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. With the market for tech talent showing some early signs of improvement, we are working to optimize fulfillment of existing engagements, unleash our entrepreneur spirit and rejuvenate the growth mindset. Switching gears for a moment, I would like to offer a few perspectives. On the long-term demand environment for technology services I believe we are in a golden era of technology and that software is the new alchemy for every business and industry. As the world prepares for a post-pandemic reset of the way we work and live our lives, we see more organizations accelerating their embrace of digital technologies. Industry is at lower levels of digital maturity like health care, life sciences and manufacturing are stepping up their tech intensity. While those that are more digitally mature like financial services, retail and communications are staying invested in digitizing the landscapes. We also interestingly see workplaces rapidly adapt digital technologies as employees get comfortable with continuously toggling between hybrid and physical workplaces. In an era of globalization that has spanned several decades, enterprises have turned to tech services companies to enable their businesses to scale and globalize. Today, every industry is a tech industry. Technology will be deeply embedded in the core of every business, every product and every service. Therefore, the use of deep software engineering capabilities to transform the core of businesses will be a big player for tech services firms like Cognizant. So too will be the market opportunity that comes from born-digital companies that outsource the technology core and operations. The cloud, needless to say, will continue to remain the biggest general purpose technology we have seen in decades, and be deeply embedded as a digital pillar in every business. Cloud migration, modernization, application services will continue to create significant market momentum. Growth will also be driven by new cloud services like data on the cloud, data exchanges, new SaaS services and cloud security services. Clients are aware of our deep alliances with the hyperscalers and new best-in-class SaaS companies as well as our ability to co-innovate with these partners. We truly believe clients will continue to turn to us to help orchestrate those cloud capabilities. The shift to the cloud and 5G have also accelerated IoT adoption as use cases grow with better connectivity and proliferating devices and that's core. Last week, we further bolstered our IoT embedded software engineering capabilities with our agreement to acquire Mobica, an IoT software engineering provider. Mobica also strengthens our near-shoring capabilities in Eastern Europe, which is home to nearly 8,000 of our associates. We see a strong push now to bring AI into business landscape with the expectation that AI will reengineer enterprises as completely as enterprise software did three decades ago. Of course, as clients navigate a challenging macro environment now, they need to fund their investments in digital transformation by executing cost and efficiency agendas. These same clients are now asking how we can help them achieve their cost reduction ambitions and underwrite savings for their digital initiatives. Given our broad capabilities, we can help clients, whether they need to drive efficiency gains, innovation or an end-to-end transformation of the business. I quickly want to turn for a moment to India, home to about three quarters of Cognizant's workforce. India is likely to be the world's technology talent hub for the next decade. India's population has a demographic profile and digital talent pool unmatched by any other country. And NASSCOM forecasts some two million IT professionals will be added to India's talent pool over the next three years. We'll continue to capitalize on this surge in the IT talent in India as we intensify efforts to recruit from India's Tier 2 cities as well. Our large associate base in India is an ongoing source of strength and differentiation for Cognizant and one in which we will continue to invest. As confident as I am in Cognizant's prospects, I'm fully aware, as we have signaled with our guidance for Q1, for quarter one, that we have a great deal of work ahead of us. It will take time to rebuild the pipeline and go after larger opportunities. Please know we put a lot of thought into our decision to hold off on providing full year guidance. But before making commitments I can stand behind, I really need to spend more time digging into the business and talking to associates and clients. Keep in mind that we are building on a strong foundation. We have a long-standing client relationships, a broad portfolio of industry-specific solutions, a robust and resilient global delivery network, a significant opportunity for international expansion and most important, a reenergized and highly motivated team. I intend to catalyze Cognizant's heritage culture of bold ambitions, our entrepreneur spirit that emphasizes being fast, agile and adaptable and of course, our camaraderie and teamwork. I'm super energized to lead Cognizant into the next era of growth, and I'll put everything I have into making this happen. As I've shared with all our associates, our mantra right now is to bring back growth and be the employer of choice. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jan, who will take you through the financial details of the quarter before we take over questions. Jan, over to you. Thank you, Ashwin, for that question. Good to connect with you. Having spent a significant time in this industry. I would say to build a growth mindset. There are a number of things we need to do. But I would probably highlight three of them as I talked to today, the most important priorities. First and foremost, Cognizant has to be an employer of choice in this industry. What I mean by that is spending time in the IT industry, IT service industry, what I mean by that is, you create a self-reinforcing cycle with employees and clients. Sustained success is based on quality, dedication and scale of the talent, but client experience and employee experience are so tightly linked. We have the opportunity to build a self-reinforcing cycle with engaged talent with a passion for clients and the growth mindset, which attracts the best clients. So that whole flywheel has to be self-reinforcing. It means a lot of things, all the way from retention to upscaling to leadership development to infusing the project and program leaders. Remember, we are a company of projects and programs, which essentially means as they walk the corridors, they mine our clients, these project leaders. And equally, they talk to our associates every day. So that is a starting point of where you try to build a trust with that player and continue to create that self-reinforcing virtual [ph] cycle does they call it. I think you talked about large deals. I think large deals has investments on both sides, investments on dealmakers, deal influencers, ability to create that momentum by supporting our client initiatives in various transformational initiatives of theirs. But equally, at the back end, you have to start to work on solutioning capabilities and the ability to build a continuum all the way from addressing cost takeout initiatives to manage services initiatives to large deals will come with people take over opportunities. And of course, productivity improvements. So there's a lot of tooling and infrastructure. I think Cognizant already has some of it, you have to build on it, and then go behind this opportunity. It's equally important that we build operational discipline, which also helps us to create the growth mindset all the way from fulfilling those deals to building market competitiveness on cost takeout initiatives to contract life cycle and risk management to consortium like deals and partnerships and a whole bunch of things. Well, do we have all of this in place? Yes. I think a lot of these things have already been set and I would say in the last few years at Cognizant. I have to orient this to a growth mindset and start to double down on the opportunities, which are there in the market. In the short run, some of this will mean additional investments, but in the medium to long run, you have to create that pool of investments inside by taking out costs so that you can then sustain that momentum for the future. Yes, that's a good question. I'm just three weeks into the job, so I'm continuing to assess what we have, what we need to do. It's a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle. As I said, as much as it looks easy, it's \u2013 if you're on it it's easy, if you're not on it it's not. I'm going to be on a listening tour for the next few weeks and months, meeting clients, meeting associates, meeting partners and I'll come back with assessment. I think we have built enough both on client and employee infrastructure \u2013 organizational infrastructure. Now I have to refine it and reset it for growth; that's how I see it. I want to build on it. We're not going to go back to the drawing board. We want to build on what we have and refine it, and as we refine it, we'll make some changes and get there. With related to employees, a lot of our \u2013 two-thirds of our employees work out of India. So India is an integral part of our strategy to differentiate and I'm going to spend the next few weeks in India as well, later part of February. And I'm meeting 100 clients in 100 days, and this is a goal which I've set for my own self, so that you get to know the pulse, you get stay focused on large deals. In fact, I'm doing a monitoring of 10 large deals every week, and we are continuing to keep the focus on commercial momentum. So it's in flight transformation, as I call it. We'll continue to do this, but we will continue to look for the medium- to long-term sustained momentum, how you create it. That's how I see it. It's still a question I will probably like to answer once I spend a few more weeks going through the listening part. And also the talent supply chain, we've been able to streamline it, strengthen it, and be ready for fulfillment and opportunities, which our clients are looking forward to. Thank you. Jan, I think you've covered it so nicely. The one thing I would probably add is, I think in the last one to two years, Cognizant has invested heavily on organizational infrastructure to take large deals on a continuum, all the way from managed services to transaction-based pricing to cost takeout initiatives to digital transformation on that continuum. Now is the time to leverage those investments and take those large deals and be competitive on those large deals. So in a way, I would say a large part of it is done. We have now strengthened it, and we have oriented to the market for the opportunity, which is going to be presented to us. So that's broadly how I see it. As I keep saying, it isn't going back to the drawing board, but I'm going to build on what we have. We're going to refine it. As we refine it, we have to make some changes. We're going to make those changes, but we'll be agile enough in the market to seize the opportunities we have. Yes. That's a good question, and I'm going to leave it to Jan as well to chime in. Over the years, IT Services has gone from a homogeneous landscape to a heterogeneous landscape, they're different swim lanes. In an uncertain economic environment, if you're going to see discrete study spend being a little softer. Large digital transformation engagements will start to become moderate in nature. But equally, you're going to see cost takeout initiatives, vendor consolidation initiatives happening on the other hand, I would say that's a different swim lane. But enterprises are continuing to invest because not only are they investing on the consumer side of digital. We're also investing on the employee side of digital because employees today are interacting with their organizations on a digital platform because of the hybridness of how work and what places are.  So I would say it's a duality of sorts. On one side, you would see softness. On the other side, you would see cost takeout and vendor consolidation kind of happening. Depending on the industry you look for, there are industries which have lesser tech and digital intensity and the industries which have higher tech and digital intensity. And some of them are using the digital platform to transform and deliver.  In fact, I would say, digital technologies is almost like a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. So some of our clients are using digital technologies to do so. So it's a mixed bag. It's \u2013 because of the heterogeneity, I would say it's a mixed bag; each swim lane has its own characteristics. Jan, do you want to chime in? I think it's how I will see it. And of course, I need more time to assess, as I said, it's listening to with both clients and my associates. But the way I see it is the opportunity ahead of us. I think we have an extraordinary set of client relationships, extraordinary talent pool. Looking from outside, I've always been impressed by the entrepreneurs spirit, the bold ambitions and some very good teamwork at Cognizant.  The one trend I've always been excited about at Cognizant is the confluence of industry vertical experience with technology expertise, a very unique spot. It's a very, very unique spot. So I could almost see this as a way forward strength and look for opportunities, which will fit the bill. And I do believe that we have been necessary organizational infrastructure to attract employees, retail employees, attract clients, retail clients and also win large deals.  That is how I see it. The opportunity in front of us is what I'm kind of configuring and calibrating the firm to instead of actually looking back and looking forward and trying to gear up for that opportunity with what we have and what we need to build. So that's broadly what I can say. How I'm actually trying to approach my way forward direction. Yes. So just to add to what Jan said, I think my initial few weeks, one of the observations is I think our talent supply chain is grinding well or it's kind of moving very, very well. Some of the clients I've spoken to in the last few weeks have started to tell us that we can start to get some of the demand moved to Cognizant with the fulfillment starting to look good.  So I'm actually very excited about the progress we've made on fulfillment. I think we are ready to take more, and we're ready to continuously sharpen the talent supply chain for the opportunity with our clients. Our clients are starting to see that traction with us. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com.  The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5.6% year-over-year in constant currency, short of our expectations. Adjusted operating margin grew 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% of revenue. While a non-certain macroeconomic backdrop impacted bookings and revenue, the primary driver of the revenue shortfall relates to a reduction in U.S. onshore billable resources in recent quarters, following a period of elevated attrition, a reduction in visa travel and a COVID-induced shift in the near and offshore delivery centers. Financial impact of this headcount reduction is magnified given this is our highest revenue and margin dollar per head population.  To reverse this trend, we have already initiated a series of action that are intended to increase U.S. onshore billable resources, including enhanced focus on lateral hires and subcontractors, accelerated visa travel and targeted compensation programs. While these actions are gaining traction, it is somewhat slower than previously anticipated. We, therefore, expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter, ahead of clear progress in Q1.  Let me now turn your attention to global third quarter voluntary attrition, which was a little higher than expected in the quarter. Voluntary attrition fell 2 points sequentially to 29% on an annualized basis and fell 3 points sequentially on a trailing 12-month basis.  We've taken extensive actions to increase employee engagement and reduce attrition over the past year. These initiatives, coupled with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, have led to reduced daily resignations, a leading indicator of voluntary attrition across the globe in the last 4 months. We expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter.  To maintain positive momentum on resignations, we are continuing our comprehensive effort to attract, retain and rally employees. We remain focused on our people strategy, which includes our refined promotion initiative, learning and development, and enhanced compensation and benefits programs. For instance, we recently communicated to our associates that we will accelerate next year's merit to the second quarter of 2023, meaning we will have 2 more cycles in the space of 6 months from most of our associates.  I would like to now discuss the macroeconomic environment, which Jan will also address in our fourth quarter guidance. We see clients closely scrutinizing and slowing their investment decisions for the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions. [indiscernible] has been reduced on lower-priority projects or those with a longer return on investment. We're seeing some early signs of slowing in discretionary digital projects.  Industry-wise, we've seen weakness in banking, especially in the mortgage segment, Health sciences and retail. In our international business, the U.K. remains solid, but deal cycles are slowing, while Continental Europe is showing signs of weakness.  From a commercial point of view, despite a strategy to sell solution and deliver client outcomes, we remain exposed to time and material engagement across all industries. We've seen clients curtailing this spending, and we expect furloughs to impact the fourth quarter. These factors contributed to a decline in bookings of 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing an in-period book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x on a trailing 12-month basis.  Turning now to our industry segment performance. Financial Services grew 1.6% year-over-year in constant currency, led by growth in our insurance business. This includes a negative impact of 180 basis points from the exit of Samlink. In insurance, carriers of all lines of business are enhancing their digital capabilities driven by demand for new insurance products and improved user experience. For example, Resolution Life US turned to us to execute several digital transformation initiatives that include large-scale data and application core modernization and cloud migrations. We're also helping them develop and scale advanced capabilities in data and analytics to drive significant operational efficiencies in our closed book portfolio.  We were selected by AXA U.K. in Ireland as a technology partner to help consolidate, modernize and manage partners their IT operations. AXA is transforming its technology ecosystem to create a more digitally enabled modern and agile environment that's data-rich, secure and sustainable.  Health Sciences revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by digital services among pharmaceutical and health care payer clients. I'm pleased to note that our shared investigator platform, a SaaS solution for pharmaceutical companies that streamlines clinical trials to improve the speed of drug discovery, has surpassed 250,000 users across 100 countries worldwide. [indiscernible], a Japanese pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, has signed a multiyear agreement with Cognizant to provide global [indiscernible] and help improve patient health through the analysis of adverse reactions across its products.  In Products and Resources, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our digital services among logistics, automotive, consumer goods and travel and hospitality clients. During the quarter, we extended our long-standing relationship with Centrica, the U.K.'s largest supplier of energy and energy services, deliver business-critical services encompassing application testing, client infrastructure support and IT infrastructure management.  Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 10.4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength among digital native clients. We're expanding our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate digital transformation through a new 5G experience center in Atlanta. The collaboration combines our deep expertise in 5G, IoT, cloud and data analytics with Qualcomm's intelligent edge devices, AI and 5G connectivity solutions.  We've also had our first substantial win in the legal sector, which has traditionally been a latecomer to outsourcing and digital services. Freshfields selected us to manage their global IT operations and support their ambitious global expansion plans. We'll be providing 24/7 managed service of the firmed IT infrastructure applications as well as managing its service desk. Cognizant will also help define Freshfields technology transformation road map.  As I mentioned in our last earnings call, targeted M&A remains an important tool for enhancing our competitiveness. We have several M&A targets in the pipeline in line with our strategy and capital allocation framework. As always, we continue to focus on opportunities, which are value-accretive among its shareholders and align with our strategy.  Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner based in Dallas. These practices will complement our existing finance and HR advisory services on the Workday Cloud Platform. The acquisition is anticipated to close by year-end 2022, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. At which stage, we expect to welcome nearly 400 new employees to our strategic Workday practice.  Importantly, we continue to strengthen our leadership team. Last month, [indiscernible] Ravi Kumar, President of Cognizant Americas. He will join us in mid-January from [indiscernible], where he served as President for the past 6 years. Ravi brings client centricity and a growth mindset that we believe will help improve our U.S. revenue trajectory.  We also announced Prasad Sankaran as the new Head of our Software and Platform Engineering Practice. Prasad joined us yesterday from Bain, where he was a Senior Vice President in the firm's Enterprise Technology Global Practice. Prior to that, he spent 25 years in senior leadership roles with Accenture. Both announcements speak highly of our ability to attract world-class talent and support 2 key strategic areas for Cognizant, the Americas region and leading enterprise technology transformation.  Before passing the call to Jan, I would like to stress that while we're in a period of economic uncertainty, the entire leadership team knows we must execute better on things that we can control, including optimizing our resources globally and getting the right mix on and offshore in a dynamic demand environment.  We will continue to focus on and hone our operational discipline, which is intended to enable us to adapt quickly to demand changes. While we're in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain highly optimistic on the key services market and our opportunity within it.  Finally, following sustained progress in reducing voluntary resignation rates, we expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter, allowing us to repivot client conversations from fulfillment to innovation, strategic transformation and growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of our quarter and our fourth quarter financial outlook before we take your questions.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 revenue was below our guidance range, driven primarily by lower billable headcount in North America. Higher-than-expected attrition, coupled with strong competition for talent in North America, made it challenging for us to maintain required staffing levels to meet our revenue forecast. An uncertain macroeconomic backdrop led to pockets of bookings and revenue weaknesses in certain industries.  The weaker-than-expected revenue performance was offset by commercial discipline, the benefit from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage, which resulted in sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansion.  Now moving on to the details for the quarter. Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 2.4% year-over-year or 5.6% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of this year.  In Q3, digital revenue as reported grew 7% year-over-year or 11% at constant currency. Digital represented approximately 51% of total revenue for the quarter, up 2 points from the prior year period. Our slower digital revenue growth reflected the expected lower inorganic contribution we discussed last quarter and the lower billable headcount in North America mentioned earlier.  These factors and softening demand environment also contributed to a bookings performance below our expectations. Q3 bookings declined 2% year-over-year and represented an in-period book-to-bill of approximately 1x. This resulted in a trailing 12-month bookings of $23.1 million and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x, unchanged from Q2.  Brian has already taken us through the segment performance, but I will spend a minute discussing several trends we are seeing emerge across our 2 largest segments. Within Financial Services, banking revenue growth slowed this quarter. This portfolio has a higher mix of time and material business, which we believe is more vulnerable to changes in the economic outlook of our clients.  Additionally, mortgage clients have been impacted by rising interest rates, which has a negative impact on our results. These headwinds were offset by continued growth within insurance, particularly within property and casualty, where we are seeing good traction in both middle market and large global carriers.  We're continuing to invest and strengthen our banking and financial services portfolio to improve the revenue trajectory over the medium term. Within Health Science, our growth was again driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Health care payer growth was consistent with last quarter, and we have seen the ramp-up of integration-related services following the software product growth earlier this year. However, the health care industry has not been immune to pressures driven by the macro uncertainty as we have seen softer demand both across health care payer and life sciences.  Clients are slowing discretionary spending as they await greater clarity on the economy and navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment. Continuing with the year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue grew 4%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which consists of all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 10%, including a negative 220 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the U.K., up 19%, which had a strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients.  Now moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 16.4% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP operating margin increased by 100 basis points, and adjusted operating margin increased by basis points. Year-over-year, margin expansion was primarily driven by SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivering efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, delivering an approximate 80 basis points of benefit, net of hedges year-over-year.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which included the benefit from a discrete tax item in the quarter. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.2%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.22, and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.17, up 18% and 10% year-over-year, respectively.  Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q3 was $953 million, representing approximately 150% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion or 92% of net income. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by 2 days year-over-year.  During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to approximately $1.5 billion through the first 9 months of 2022.  Turning to our forward outlook. We are revising our full year guidance downward, which reflects headwinds from currency, lower North America billable headcount, which we expect to take several quarters to improve, and softer-than-expected bookings growth. Offsetting these factors are several tailwinds, including sustained reductions in resignations globally and our expectation for lower attrition in the fourth quarter.  For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.72 billion to $4.77 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 0.2% to 1.2% or growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 320 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 30 basis points.  Together, these factors contribute to our revised full year revenue guidance of approximately $19.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 4.5% or 7% in constant currency. This assumes approximately 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative basis points of impact from currency versus 220 basis points previously. This compares to our prior full year revenue guidance of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, which represented growth of 6.3% to 7.3% or 8.5% to 9.5% in constant currency.  We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 15.6% at the low end of our prior range. This implies Q4 adjusted operating margin of around 15.3% at the midpoint of our EPS range, reflecting the reduced revenue outlook and the annual merit cycle for most employees that is effective October 1.  Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $50 million versus $35 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. We still expect average shares outstanding of approximately $519 million, unchanged. Our tax guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged.  Finally, our revised full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.43 to $4.46 represents growth of approximately 7% to 8%. This compares to prior guidance of $4.51 to $4.57. Our longer-term capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual yesterday, and we expect our acquisition pipelines to remain active. Our share repurchase assumption for the full year is unchanged at $1.2 billion. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors.  In support of our balanced capital deployment strategy, the Board has also approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, which brings our total remaining authorization to over $3 billion as of today. We are also still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.  Before opening the call for questions, I want to reinforce that the leadership team is focused on addressing the operational challenges impacting our recent results. We are also closely monitoring macroeconomic factors to help enable us to quickly respond to changes in the demand environment. Longer term, we remain confident in our market opportunity.  With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: I'll start on the attrition point that you've raised that seems to, I guess, be at the root cause of some of the challenges you're having both on revenue and on bookings. In the past, you've focused a lot on the initiatives you're undertaking in India related to attrition and haven't spent as much time on the dynamics of what's going on in North America. Can you just elaborate a bit on what exactly is happening in North America? Is this recent? Have you pinpointed like specifically what's causing the elevated attrition and maybe elaborate a bit on the time frame and the steps you're taking to address it?\nBrian Humphries: Lisa, it's Brian. So look, at a global level, I would say we're doing similar things in North America as we're doing in India. Clearly, on a weighted basis, India had the biggest impact on our attrition historically. So we put inordinate efforts and war rooms in place over there. And frankly, in India as well as in North America and our international business in Europe and Asia, we have seen resignations come down pretty much for 4 to 5 months in a row now. So those efforts are kicking in, and those efforts are broad-based, including the obvious compensation elements. And as we announced, we just announced our second merit increase in 6 months. But on top of comp, there's merit, there is a career path progression, promotion process overall, learning and development initiatives, et cetera. And so the North America efforts are somewhat similar to what we're doing globally.  I think in North America, we've gone through a pretty material visa, I would say, a process in the last 3 years as we reduce our visa dependency. But obviously, in a tough market environment where digital scales are at a premium, we've been suffering attrition in North America, and by definition, obviously going out as fast as we can to recruit talent simultaneously. And those factors, coupled with what's effectively happened across the industry and ours, was no different. A shift to nearshore and offshore during COVID has led us to have a, I would say, suboptimal level of onshore billable resources in North America, and it catches up quickly with you because of the order of magnitude of the difference in terms of revenue and margin dollar per head in North America versus in India. So it's a question of rebalancing that.  We have major initiatives underway, operational rigor behind it. We had hoped to make more progress in the quarter. It's a little slower than we anticipated, but we're putting a lot of effort behind that to correct it. And it's all of the factors we mentioned above.  At a global level, we're expecting, I would say, significant voluntary attrition reductions now going into the fourth quarter. The goodness of the last 4 months will kick in, in Q4.\nLisa Ellis: Got it. Okay. Okay. And then I know last quarter, you had commented on kind of the relationship between the attrition challenges and bookings, and you were taking some actions to sort of address the bookings issues or kind of that linkage. I think you're having challenges that some of your salespeople perhaps were concerned they wouldn't be able to staff a project or something. And so we're delaying it or -- right? So -- but then I guess it persisted into this quarter. So can you just also -- yes.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, I mean, let me start with the facts first on bookings. They were down 2% year-over-year, a little below what we had hoped for the quarter, to be honest. It is important, I'd say, to recognize the tough comparison in the second half of last year with 20% plus bookings growth. So that leads to even an in-quarter bookings book-to-bill of 1.0, and on a trailing 12-month basis, still at 1.2. So healthy enough, although, frankly, we lost some deals in the quarter that slipped out quarters. And that's, I think, somewhat indicative of an uncertain macroeconomic demand environment. We've seen lengthening purchase cycles and clients being a little bit more judicious in their approval of expenses.  But Lisa, specific then to the impact of attrition, by definition, as people were dialoguing with clients around price increases, which has been one of our success stories, helping margin as well as addressing fulfillment challenges, it's made the commercial team somewhat hesitant, I think, to go to full mild to get the commercial momentum as strong as it needs to be in terms of increasing pipeline and accelerating bookings.  The good news now is we're quite vocal with our team in terms of what we're seeing from a resignation point of view, and therefore, what they should be anticipating in Q4 in terms of attrition levels, which, as I said, will be meaningfully down from Q3 voluntary attrition levels. So I think we're starting now to get confidence in the commercial team that the effort we put in place around attrition and resignations will kick in. Of course, this is happening in a period where, as I said on the call, we're a little more concerned now than we were 3 months ago in terms of the macro demand environment. So that's probably been a bigger impact on bookings this quarter than previously, the whole concern amongst the C-suite as they're scrutinizing their spends, and it's not clear to me that we'll see a budget flush at the end of this year, and we'll certainly anticipate furloughs at the end of this year relative to last year. So it remains to be seen, and we factor that into our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity.\nRod Bourgeois: Yes, guys. So you have 4% constant currency growth in North America and essentially 10% outside of North America. So I wanted to ask how you feel about your progress and outlook in ramping your international revenue presence and also ask if your efforts in doing that are detracting from your efforts in North America or perhaps it's just that your talent challenges are more pronounced in North America, but some color on that would be really helpful.\nBrian Humphries: No. I'll start with the international business, which we expect very good things in the coming years there. We've refreshed some leadership over there. We've added with the senior [indiscernible] of the people we've recruited, we've added M&A to complement their capabilities. And examples of that include the U.K., Germany and Australia. And I've spent a large part of the last year going around the world, and I'm pretty optimistic around our potential internationally. So we're optimistic, but I don't think it's really taken away from the North America focus.  In North America, Canada there has been a shift more to offshore and nearshore. We're building out capabilities in Canada. But candidly, a shiftwards India has happened -- our net headcount has materially increased in India on a year-over-year basis, and we have to -- we get the balance right.  Three years ago, we were over visa-dependent in North America. We've been pretty disciplined around that as we are trying to land that at the right level. Candidly, what's been happening in the COVID world is that consulates internationally are just not functioning at the same capacity as before. So we've gone a little bit too far in that. That's actually a good news, by the way, in terms of reversing that for our attrition because that has hurt our attrition in the last 2, 3 years as people saw that opportunity be less available than previously, but now that we're turning that tap on a little bit to rebalance subject to the capacity of consulates that will not only help onshore headcount, but actually help morale and I believe attrition in India as well.  So I think the U.S. onshore situation is independent of the international positivity that I have, and I'm very optimistic around our potential there in the years to come.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. And let me ask a follow-up about the cloud services market. We definitely see some changes happening in that market. So I just wanted to ask about what you're seeing in that market, particularly your competitive position there, and to what extent some of the recent macro challenges are having an impact in cloud or maybe not so much. It'd be great to hear some thoughts on the cloud market.\nBrian Humphries: Well, first of all, I'll actually call out Prasad Sankaran, who joined us yesterday. He's got a very strong background in cloud as well. So he and I spent a great deal of time talking about where that market is going. And ironically, in the client Advisory Board last week, it was a great topic of discussion amongst [indiscernible] clients, too. . I would say our position with some of the packaged application players like Salesforce, Workday is stronger than it's been for many, many years. And so we feel good about the progress there. And yesterday's announcements of OneSource Virtual, we'll continue to strengthen our Workday practice. Vis-a-vis the hyperscalers, it's kind of interesting. I'm seeing clients clearly accelerate their path to the cloud. Within the same vein, Rod, I see a growing dialogue amongst clients around how to optimize your position in the cloud as in lifting and shifting your current suite of applications [indiscernible] refactoring or another way transforming ahead of the transition. It doesn't necessarily always give them the efficiencies that they would have anticipated. So there's more dialogue around how to optimize your cloud journey.  And so what you'll see us do and continue to do is stand up capabilities and resources behind that, both in the cloud practice as well as in our consulting business as we anticipate cloud modernization journeys or tech more generally, you'll see us add more advisory capabilities there as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Could you talk about what you're seeing in digital especially since you mentioned slowing discretionary spend? Is that more of a company-specific positional thing because other companies have spoken to have not yet mentioned anything specific with regards to digital specifically slowing down?\nBrian Humphries: So look, the first thing on a broader macroeconomic environment, I'd say it's difficult to be conclusive or dogmatic at this moment in time. It's certainly what we determine uncertain macroeconomic environment. And the outlook is a little more concerning now than it was 3 months ago if you go back to my comments back then. We are seeing spend being reduced in lower priority projects or those with longer ROI periods. And even discretionary cloud projects, as I referenced in my prepared remarks, are selectively being reduced. So we still have a lot of confidence in our digital capabilities. Our portfolio is now 51%, digital up 2 points year-over-year. But some of the challenges we talked about, the macro demand picture as well as the U.S. onshore situation are equally applicable to this. And then as you know, yesterday's announcement of acquisition -- the first acquisition we've done this year. So we haven't had the tailwind in our digital momentum that we had last year from the series of acquisitions that we did. That being said, as Jan pointed out, we are committed to our framework of extending our portfolio in line with our digital strategy, and we have a series of deals in the pipeline as we speak.  So I'd expect that ultimately over time to get back in a more normal course for us. But I don't believe that all digital projects will be immune from the current economic climate.\nJan Siegmund: And maybe in addition, Ashwin, to give you a little bit more the framework on the M&A side, our full year guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of contribution from M&A, approximately half of what we typically see. So if you multiply that types of share of digital revenues, you'll see there is an impact on just mathematically on the lack of M&A fueling digital growth.  And then aside from the demand -- market demand that Brian mentioned, obviously, in North America, we are also affected by our fulfillment challenges that we experienced in the quarter, which proportionately affected our non-digital business as well as our digital business. So it's a combination of all these factors together.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Got it. Got it. And what does this lower exit growth rate for the year means in terms of achieving sort of your medium-term targets? And I completely appreciate the high level of macro uncertainty that we have, but any granular thoughts how you're planning for next year would be greatly helpful.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. So that somehow I thought the question would come up. So number one is we feel our growth framework that we discussed with you in basically pretty much a year ago -- a little bit more than a year ago, it's still intact overall.  Maybe a few pointers, the growth framework sees our revenue growth, which you're referring to, really in light of a CAGR over the 3-year time horizon. So it's a compounding growth. And obviously, we didn't quite anticipate at that point the economic uncertainty that we're facing today, but we think the framework from our perspective is intact. And then we will give guidance, obviously, for next year in our fourth quarter earnings call in January.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Just on the fulfillment challenges. I know that kind of was an issue last quarter, and it seems like it got pushed into this quarter. And then it's caused you to miss the guidance, that and maybe the economy a little bit. Just trying to figure out, is the fourth quarter -- how comfortable are you with those numbers? Or could we still have some of these fulfillment issues lingering that could push us into lowering expectations again?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Maybe I'll start with it, and then I'll let Brian jump on top of it. If we think about the mix, as Brian mentioned and as we talked on our call, had a number of factors in it in fulfillment as fairly logical. So we misjudged or we had a little bit -- a faster improvement in the third quarter of our attrition anticipated. And so about that, that miss attrition improvement made about 1/3 of our miss relative to our expectations.  And then we have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate the hiring and inflow, in particular, in North America of initiatives. And that represents approximately also 1/3 of our miss to revenue guidance. And here, we obviously saw the North American challenge to grow our headcount and initiatives in place from funding our -- and ensuring we have full capacity of hiring in place to focusing on the full fledge of resources available to us, including the utilization of subcontractors and accelerating visa travel and increasing employee referral product. So we have a set of initiatives in place. These initiatives have shown initial momentum, but they were scaling slower than we anticipated.  So we have now our trajectory, and we think we have appropriately risk-adjusted our new revenue guidance. So we're keenly interested to meet our own expectations in it. And so yes, we have assumed an improvement in attrition levels that we can see. But we also see now the trajectories of some of these initiatives clearer than we had in the third quarter.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. And just to build on that, the resignations visibility we have, of course, differs in India versus North America because the notification period in India is slightly different. But I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call had July resignations have come down, and through August and September, it was a different plateau for those 3 months vis-a-vis the prior 6 months.  Certainly, if you look at India and indeed in North America and Europe, and in the first month of this quarter, it's continued to be low, in fact, lower than the prior 3 months. So we feel, Bryan, at this stage, very, very confident about that. And as Jan rightly pointed out, we wanted to give guidance that we want to make sure we can hit. So we're in the right zone.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then did the fulfillment challenges, especially in North America, will that be fixed by the time we get into the first quarter? Or could it linger into the first half of the year?\nBrian Humphries: We're aiming. As I said on the -- in my prepared remarks, we're working through that as quickly as we can, and we aim to make progress in Q4, but I think it'll still be a headwind in Q4. We hope by the time we come out of Q4, and we'll clearly give you an update on that in next quarter's earnings call, we hope to walk into Q1 with clear progress by the time we get through Q1.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Brian. Another one on the fulfillment issues. Could you give us some real-time insight into the nature of conversations that you're having with clients here? And kind of just thinking about all the rebranding and repositioning that the company has done in recent years, what are you doing to reassure clients that you are a digital transformation partner of choice?\nBrian Humphries: We actually see different stories, to be honest, Brian, across different industries in terms of our evolution towards digital, even banking where we are, let's say, more heavily exposed to time and materials. We have been able to increase our digital mix, and we've got some good proof points with certain clients. But more fundamentally, the journey we've been on is to extend the portfolio, which we've been successfully doing in recent years, and yesterday's announcement is another example of that.  To try to complement that portfolio then with a client-facing team that is more consultative in nature as anybody who's overseen a sales force and knows that is a multiyear journey. So we're en route, but it takes time to get there.  To complement then that more consultative sales force with a more industry-aligned consulting business, and so that's the space we should continue to watch in Cognizant because we will invest behind that, and we've got strong leaders in the capacity these days and then just to make sure that there's increasing brand awareness around the capabilities we have and references and case studies that we can showcase.  Last week in the Client Advisory Board was a very good example of certain clients not really been truly aware of the extent of our portfolio. So we have [Technical Difficulty] ourself. But I would say brand awareness of the company is up. Digital awareness is increasing, but it's a multiyear journey, and we're in the middle of all of that. And it starts with our client-facing teams and our delivery capabilities and our partnerships. And I certainly see in dialogue, with some of our key packaged application partners like Salesforce and SAP, growing recognition that we are getting stronger. But as ever, a few years ago, we were quite low in terms of digital mix, and we've been working our way back up to 50%, which we're pleased to cross, but there's more work to do.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And just a follow-up. The forward-looking attrition commentary is encouraging. You've been vocal about the new normal for attrition being higher than pre-COVID levels. Perhaps you can share updated views here and the time line for when [indiscernible] is more in a steady state mode as it relates to attrition.\nBrian Humphries: I think it's very hard to really be precise on that, Bryan. There's just so much going on in today's world. We've gone through a period of pretty significant disconnect between demand supply on key labor -- key digital skills. We're going through a hybrid work environment as a society where, arguably, people are less entrenched or engaged with companies as they work remotely. And now we've gone through a very different scenario that the economy is uncertain, slowing. And people are -- recruiters have been laid off across the globe. We're seeing in certain companies, people are being laid off. And so the market is suddenly perhaps less hot than it was previously. And that can also have an immediate impact on attrition trends and voluntary resignations in particular.  So we will see where water find its own level over time. I'm encouraged by our specific actions that we've taken. Jan and I have also built that into our financial plan. So we have, notwithstanding a slowing, I would say, labor markets, we know that we want to invest on a sustainable basis in our employees in the years to come, and we factored that into our multiyear financial framework, and that will help increase our relative compensation vis-a-vis peers. And simultaneously, we're doing everything we can around training and development and career path and employee value proposition.  So I'm not sure when it normalizes to a new norm. I still believe there will be a new norm, and we won't go back to historical levels. And I think as a society at large, we'll probably see attrition slow across the industry in Q4 and beyond. But time will tell.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: In terms of skills and looking at kind of -- as that relates to fulfillment, where are you seeing the most challenges in terms of finding the appropriate people and getting them into your fulfillment capabilities right now? And how are you thinking about the pyramid itself as it relates to solving for that? And I'm just wondering how that then impacts the you think about financial guidance? Kind of a complicated question, but hopefully, that's clear.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. I mean there's -- it's actually quite nuanced because, first of all, our headcount has materially increased year-over-year, but most of the increase has been in India. So by definition, then you have different bill rates. Within India, the lower levels of our pyramid are actually a fatter for lack of a better word than they were in the last few years. And that's because if you go back this year, we'll bring in about 40,000 graduates, 45,000 last year, 33,000 the year before, about 17,000 the year, less than 10,000. We had been too narrow as a period previously. We've done a good job, I think, addressing that. And that afforded us the opportunity to have more upward momentum in the company, which is one of the many factors that has helped us actually drive margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially in both Q2 and Q3.  And -- but James, the fundamental element in terms of the demand supply economic imbalance and key digital scales was heavily related to skills related to all hyperscalers, things like Salesforce, [indiscernible] full stack engineers. I mean they've been probably the hottest parts of the market and there's been very irrational behavior, I would argue, over the last 18 months in terms of comp increases that went in, in glove with that. That's where we've seen the hottest challenges. In terms of the absolute attrition, it's fundamentally been in India and at the lower levels of the pyramid.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And then I guess kind of a somewhat related question, but looking more specifically at the P&L and margin impact, can you help talk us through the impacts and mechanics of merit cycle changes? Are those accelerating? Are they going to be permanent? I guess should we expect 2 cycles a year? And just trying to make sure that we're contemplating that -- how that flows through the actual P&L appropriately.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. That's maybe for me to answer. So effectively, our acceleration of our typical merit cycle that we're just experiencing in the fourth quarter and moving it up to the second quarter has really -- a main reason for it is to better align our HR processes, evaluation processes and reward processes together. So it is a benefit from a talent management perspective to have our merit increase in the second quarter. So that's really a very important driver of it.  And second important driver is obviously because we're accelerating the second -- this merit cycle by 2 quarters, we will incur a onetime shift of compensation by -- to our merit increase by 2 quarters forward. And that's going to be a onetime effect only because we're staying with an annual merit increase process. So in 2024, the normal cycle will be 4 quarters later again in the second quarter of the year.  So we are capturing basically, I think, here an opportunity to improve our talent management processes, but also allows -- which also allows us to drive a faster compensation increase to our associates, which we think is timely because we really do want to be focused on attrition, and we anticipate that, that will have a positive impact on attrition, even though hard to measure, but we think it will send a positive signal of our commitment to our associates to be competitive on compensation and benefits.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan..\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just thinking about the knock-on effects of the fatter pyramid plus the attrition. Just -- is there an impact there on your ability to capture price or even be competitive on pursuing new work bookings, that sort of thing? Just trying to understand sort of the collateral impact because you're seeing some of that.\nJan Siegmund: So what we -- maybe I'll talk a little bit about our overall maybe gross margin development, kind of what you're focusing on, Tien-Tsin, here is we did see, obviously, a decline, but I think the relative performance overall compared to the [indiscernible] has been relatively good.  And so a few factors I want to point out. When we talk about pricing, I think we need to kind of -- in particular, now that we have been added for a little while, think about them as a regular contractual increase, pricing increases with our clients, but also a discipline to price our business appropriately in the market. And with both of these things, we have seen slow start in the fiscal year. And now we have seen steady improvement and compounding impact of those initiatives. So that has been getting better and has helped us on the relative gross margin performance.  Also, the shift to the -- in our pyramid has been positive. We have been able to, to a large degree, offset the impact of comp and benefit increases by streamlining our pyramid and focusing on a slimmer permit, as mentioned, and that paired this promotion opportunities, which are positive, our associates, I think, we'll have over the next couple of years, as that is still scaling and maturing, a positive impact on how we price and how we win deals.  So we're feeling, I think, good -- well, we're feeling good about the improvements we're making of how we manage the business opportunities. It's a thoughtful process. It allows us actually also to make our strategic best moving forward. I think our margin profile is in good shape, and that should offer us opportunities to make our strategic bets where we want to go and grow faster revenues on a much more solid base than we are today.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. The only thing I would add there, Tien-Tsin, is I don't think we were doing anything except correcting what was an overly narrow pyramid back in the day. And on the contrary, I think because we had somewhat canceled the college intake in prior years, it led us having folks further up the pyramid doing work at lower billable rates than were optimal.  So I think what we've done in India is appropriate, and it's more in line with industry rates based on the dialogue I have with those from other companies. Where we have to do a better job on campus and college graduates, I think, is both onshore in Europe and Asia as well as in North America, where we are not adequately getting after the market opportunity there. It's -- obviously, there is a war on talent still. So we have to look at vocational colleges and not just the classic places as well, and that's an area of focus we'll have.  Fortunately, with Ravi coming on board in North America, he has run a play there previously, which we will obviously aim to replicate over here. And that can help our pyramid. But generally, I feel good about our skills in our pyramid. I think we corrected something that was mis-skewed. And I don't want anybody to get off the call worried about our skill set in our pyramid where we've got very talented employees, and I feel good about that.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just quickly, if you don't mind, a quick follow-up, just on the capital allocation front. I have to ask a capital allocation question. Just with the buyback of the authorization here, just your appetite to back stock. I know you talked about the acquisition you just announced. But just thinking about buyback here at this point in the cycle.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. For this fiscal year, we gave you basically our anticipated number of $1.2 billion. And you see over the last few quarters as we have been lacking M&A activities that we basically redirected excess cash to return to our shareholders. That's the general philosophy that we've been following with no intent to build up cash on our balance sheet. And so that flexibility is in the model. We are seeing a good pipeline, though, of our M&A activity. So it's -- this we announced the deal, but compared to last quarter, we really moved the needle forward on our business development activity with very talented team. And we see also, I think, a little bit more realistic behavior in the market relative to acquisition opportunities.  So I think for us, the goal would be to get back to normal to the capital allocation framework that we have been talking about for a long time. It's going to be the mindset for us going forward.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.\nDarrin Peller: Can we maybe go into a little bit more detail on the vertical specifically and just help us understand -- maybe starting with Financial Services, but any other one you think makes sense. Really, what you believe is the driving for some of the change in outlook, whether it's, number one, macro and just pure simple demand and bookings; number two, headcount -- your billable headcount available; and number three, is there anything else that's maybe, like, either tech stack or capability or competitive dynamics? I'm just really trying to parse out what's driving the story and what can be improved on your own doing versus macro.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, it's a good question. I mean I'll start with the 2 bigger ones, Financial Services, which is about 31% of the company. It grew about 1.6 points in constant currency, but that was impacted by the exit of the Samlink business, which was previously disclosed to the tune of 180 basis points to normalize, let's say, 3.4 points of growth. And that's the low industry. We've got a lot of work to do there, as we've cited previously. . There is a slowdown in certain segments there we've touched upon in the prepared remarks, the mortgage segment in particular. I'm also seeing some of the C-suite there talking about, let's say, tightening their belts as they go into the fourth quarter and beyond. So I think that will be a tougher sector for others as well.  But fundamentally, our bigger issue there that we're evolving from, it's not just the folks we have in front of those clients, but also how the clients think of us. We've very often trained them to think of us as a provider of resources. I'm pleased to say that our digital mix in Financial Services is improving, and our staff -- or time and material mix is not improving enough yet. So we have to get that balance right in the period to come.  Insurance, we're doing better than banking, and that's obviously in banking area we've got to go fix. In Health Services, we feel very good about our position on a relative basis or a competitive basis in both payer provider as well as life sciences. That's one of our core franchises, I would say, as a company. The business grew about 5.5% in constant currency year-over-year. It's 29% of our business. So it's catching up on Financial Services overall. We've had good momentum in the [indiscernible] business in the last few years. So I feel pretty good about our relative position there.  And then if I talk about the other 2 portions of the business where we have actually historically in the last 2 years, 3 years, been growing double digits, CMT is a good success story of ours. We've had good client acquisition there, good constant currency growth.  Products and Resources, I think we have a lot of room to continue to do well there because our penetration of large accounts is lower there than it is as an example in life sciences, or indeed, the payer business where we are heavily penetrated into the major players. So that's kind of how I think about the framework.  The factors we touched upon today, elevated attrition across the industry and Cognizant, within that permeated across all industry segments, and indeed, the U.S. onshore situation permeated across all as well. So nothing specific to either of those.\nDarrin Peller: All right. Just one quick follow-up on the margin side. It did come in well. And I mean your guidance is relatively unchanged also for margin. So just thinking about that in terms of going forward a little more than just the fourth quarter, it would seem that if wage inflation calms down a bit, you should be able to maintain that level. Is that a fair assumption?\nJan Siegmund: The -- well, I have to say and answer in the third quarter, we gave guidance in the fourth quarter. But I did mention that we feel our overall framework -- our multiyear framework is intact, and that didn't refer only to the revenue, but it refers also to our margin expectations. So that's kind of as far as I want to go for today.  We -- when you analyze the results on the margin, I think it's important to consider a number of factors. We have driven the margin expansion by having SG&A control and discipline. So it helped us to drive and leverage that SG&A as the company grew. We had also meaningful support from the depreciation of the rupee in our business.  And then I talked already about the impact that our actions had on gross margin. Gross margin was under pressure, but I think we had a lot of activity that moderated at what could have been a bigger effect on gross margin even.  So you heard me in the third quarter and continue -- and second quarter and now continues in the third quarter, we feel we have a relatively -- we have a good process in place to balance that business out. So our focus is to maintain that discipline, obviously, and then really accelerate revenue growth. That is the main focus that we're driving on because that's our biggest opportunity and use this -- the margin profile as a great foundation for that.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's Q&A portion of the call.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you all for joining. Look forward to catching up next quarter.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 5.6% year-over-year in constant currency, short of our expectations. Adjusted operating margin grew 90 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% of revenue. While a non-certain macroeconomic backdrop impacted bookings and revenue, the primary driver of the revenue shortfall relates to a reduction in U.S. onshore billable resources in recent quarters, following a period of elevated attrition, a reduction in visa travel and a COVID-induced shift in the near and offshore delivery centers. Financial impact of this headcount reduction is magnified given this is our highest revenue and margin dollar per head population.  To reverse this trend, we have already initiated a series of action that are intended to increase U.S. onshore billable resources, including enhanced focus on lateral hires and subcontractors, accelerated visa travel and targeted compensation programs. While these actions are gaining traction, it is somewhat slower than previously anticipated. We, therefore, expect these headwinds to continue in the fourth quarter, ahead of clear progress in Q1.  Let me now turn your attention to global third quarter voluntary attrition, which was a little higher than expected in the quarter. Voluntary attrition fell 2 points sequentially to 29% on an annualized basis and fell 3 points sequentially on a trailing 12-month basis.  We've taken extensive actions to increase employee engagement and reduce attrition over the past year. These initiatives, coupled with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, have led to reduced daily resignations, a leading indicator of voluntary attrition across the globe in the last 4 months. We expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter.  To maintain positive momentum on resignations, we are continuing our comprehensive effort to attract, retain and rally employees. We remain focused on our people strategy, which includes our refined promotion initiative, learning and development, and enhanced compensation and benefits programs. For instance, we recently communicated to our associates that we will accelerate next year's merit to the second quarter of 2023, meaning we will have 2 more cycles in the space of 6 months from most of our associates.  I would like to now discuss the macroeconomic environment, which Jan will also address in our fourth quarter guidance. We see clients closely scrutinizing and slowing their investment decisions for the backdrop of uncertain economic conditions. [indiscernible] has been reduced on lower-priority projects or those with a longer return on investment. We're seeing some early signs of slowing in discretionary digital projects.  Industry-wise, we've seen weakness in banking, especially in the mortgage segment, Health sciences and retail. In our international business, the U.K. remains solid, but deal cycles are slowing, while Continental Europe is showing signs of weakness.  From a commercial point of view, despite a strategy to sell solution and deliver client outcomes, we remain exposed to time and material engagement across all industries. We've seen clients curtailing this spending, and we expect furloughs to impact the fourth quarter. These factors contributed to a decline in bookings of 2% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing an in-period book-to-bill ratio of 1.0x and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x on a trailing 12-month basis.  Turning now to our industry segment performance. Financial Services grew 1.6% year-over-year in constant currency, led by growth in our insurance business. This includes a negative impact of 180 basis points from the exit of Samlink. In insurance, carriers of all lines of business are enhancing their digital capabilities driven by demand for new insurance products and improved user experience. For example, Resolution Life US turned to us to execute several digital transformation initiatives that include large-scale data and application core modernization and cloud migrations. We're also helping them develop and scale advanced capabilities in data and analytics to drive significant operational efficiencies in our closed book portfolio.  We were selected by AXA U.K. in Ireland as a technology partner to help consolidate, modernize and manage partners their IT operations. AXA is transforming its technology ecosystem to create a more digitally enabled modern and agile environment that's data-rich, secure and sustainable.  Health Sciences revenue grew 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by digital services among pharmaceutical and health care payer clients. I'm pleased to note that our shared investigator platform, a SaaS solution for pharmaceutical companies that streamlines clinical trials to improve the speed of drug discovery, has surpassed 250,000 users across 100 countries worldwide. [indiscernible], a Japanese pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, has signed a multiyear agreement with Cognizant to provide global [indiscernible] and help improve patient health through the analysis of adverse reactions across its products.  In Products and Resources, revenue grew 8.2% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our digital services among logistics, automotive, consumer goods and travel and hospitality clients. During the quarter, we extended our long-standing relationship with Centrica, the U.K.'s largest supplier of energy and energy services, deliver business-critical services encompassing application testing, client infrastructure support and IT infrastructure management.  Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 10.4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength among digital native clients. We're expanding our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate digital transformation through a new 5G experience center in Atlanta. The collaboration combines our deep expertise in 5G, IoT, cloud and data analytics with Qualcomm's intelligent edge devices, AI and 5G connectivity solutions.  We've also had our first substantial win in the legal sector, which has traditionally been a latecomer to outsourcing and digital services. Freshfields selected us to manage their global IT operations and support their ambitious global expansion plans. We'll be providing 24/7 managed service of the firmed IT infrastructure applications as well as managing its service desk. Cognizant will also help define Freshfields technology transformation road map.  As I mentioned in our last earnings call, targeted M&A remains an important tool for enhancing our competitiveness. We have several M&A targets in the pipeline in line with our strategy and capital allocation framework. As always, we continue to focus on opportunities, which are value-accretive among its shareholders and align with our strategy.  Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner based in Dallas. These practices will complement our existing finance and HR advisory services on the Workday Cloud Platform. The acquisition is anticipated to close by year-end 2022, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. At which stage, we expect to welcome nearly 400 new employees to our strategic Workday practice.  Importantly, we continue to strengthen our leadership team. Last month, [indiscernible] Ravi Kumar, President of Cognizant Americas. He will join us in mid-January from [indiscernible], where he served as President for the past 6 years. Ravi brings client centricity and a growth mindset that we believe will help improve our U.S. revenue trajectory.  We also announced Prasad Sankaran as the new Head of our Software and Platform Engineering Practice. Prasad joined us yesterday from Bain, where he was a Senior Vice President in the firm's Enterprise Technology Global Practice. Prior to that, he spent 25 years in senior leadership roles with Accenture. Both announcements speak highly of our ability to attract world-class talent and support 2 key strategic areas for Cognizant, the Americas region and leading enterprise technology transformation.  Before passing the call to Jan, I would like to stress that while we're in a period of economic uncertainty, the entire leadership team knows we must execute better on things that we can control, including optimizing our resources globally and getting the right mix on and offshore in a dynamic demand environment.  We will continue to focus on and hone our operational discipline, which is intended to enable us to adapt quickly to demand changes. While we're in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we remain highly optimistic on the key services market and our opportunity within it.  Finally, following sustained progress in reducing voluntary resignation rates, we expect sequential reductions in voluntary attrition to be more meaningful in the fourth quarter, allowing us to repivot client conversations from fulfillment to innovation, strategic transformation and growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of our quarter and our fourth quarter financial outlook before we take your questions. Lisa, it's Brian. So look, at a global level, I would say we're doing similar things in North America as we're doing in India. Clearly, on a weighted basis, India had the biggest impact on our attrition historically. So we put inordinate efforts and war rooms in place over there. And frankly, in India as well as in North America and our international business in Europe and Asia, we have seen resignations come down pretty much for 4 to 5 months in a row now. So those efforts are kicking in, and those efforts are broad-based, including the obvious compensation elements. And as we announced, we just announced our second merit increase in 6 months. But on top of comp, there's merit, there is a career path progression, promotion process overall, learning and development initiatives, et cetera. And so the North America efforts are somewhat similar to what we're doing globally.  I think in North America, we've gone through a pretty material visa, I would say, a process in the last 3 years as we reduce our visa dependency. But obviously, in a tough market environment where digital scales are at a premium, we've been suffering attrition in North America, and by definition, obviously going out as fast as we can to recruit talent simultaneously. And those factors, coupled with what's effectively happened across the industry and ours, was no different. A shift to nearshore and offshore during COVID has led us to have a, I would say, suboptimal level of onshore billable resources in North America, and it catches up quickly with you because of the order of magnitude of the difference in terms of revenue and margin dollar per head in North America versus in India. So it's a question of rebalancing that.  We have major initiatives underway, operational rigor behind it. We had hoped to make more progress in the quarter. It's a little slower than we anticipated, but we're putting a lot of effort behind that to correct it. And it's all of the factors we mentioned above.  At a global level, we're expecting, I would say, significant voluntary attrition reductions now going into the fourth quarter. The goodness of the last 4 months will kick in, in Q4. Yes. Look, I mean, let me start with the facts first on bookings. They were down 2% year-over-year, a little below what we had hoped for the quarter, to be honest. It is important, I'd say, to recognize the tough comparison in the second half of last year with 20% plus bookings growth. So that leads to even an in-quarter bookings book-to-bill of 1.0, and on a trailing 12-month basis, still at 1.2. So healthy enough, although, frankly, we lost some deals in the quarter that slipped out quarters. And that's, I think, somewhat indicative of an uncertain macroeconomic demand environment. We've seen lengthening purchase cycles and clients being a little bit more judicious in their approval of expenses.  But Lisa, specific then to the impact of attrition, by definition, as people were dialoguing with clients around price increases, which has been one of our success stories, helping margin as well as addressing fulfillment challenges, it's made the commercial team somewhat hesitant, I think, to go to full mild to get the commercial momentum as strong as it needs to be in terms of increasing pipeline and accelerating bookings.  The good news now is we're quite vocal with our team in terms of what we're seeing from a resignation point of view, and therefore, what they should be anticipating in Q4 in terms of attrition levels, which, as I said, will be meaningfully down from Q3 voluntary attrition levels. So I think we're starting now to get confidence in the commercial team that the effort we put in place around attrition and resignations will kick in. Of course, this is happening in a period where, as I said on the call, we're a little more concerned now than we were 3 months ago in terms of the macro demand environment. So that's probably been a bigger impact on bookings this quarter than previously, the whole concern amongst the C-suite as they're scrutinizing their spends, and it's not clear to me that we'll see a budget flush at the end of this year, and we'll certainly anticipate furloughs at the end of this year relative to last year. So it remains to be seen, and we factor that into our guidance. No. I'll start with the international business, which we expect very good things in the coming years there. We've refreshed some leadership over there. We've added with the senior [indiscernible] of the people we've recruited, we've added M&A to complement their capabilities. And examples of that include the U.K., Germany and Australia. And I've spent a large part of the last year going around the world, and I'm pretty optimistic around our potential internationally. So we're optimistic, but I don't think it's really taken away from the North America focus.  In North America, Canada there has been a shift more to offshore and nearshore. We're building out capabilities in Canada. But candidly, a shiftwards India has happened -- our net headcount has materially increased in India on a year-over-year basis, and we have to -- we get the balance right.  Three years ago, we were over visa-dependent in North America. We've been pretty disciplined around that as we are trying to land that at the right level. Candidly, what's been happening in the COVID world is that consulates internationally are just not functioning at the same capacity as before. So we've gone a little bit too far in that. That's actually a good news, by the way, in terms of reversing that for our attrition because that has hurt our attrition in the last 2, 3 years as people saw that opportunity be less available than previously, but now that we're turning that tap on a little bit to rebalance subject to the capacity of consulates that will not only help onshore headcount, but actually help morale and I believe attrition in India as well.  So I think the U.S. onshore situation is independent of the international positivity that I have, and I'm very optimistic around our potential there in the years to come. Well, first of all, I'll actually call out Prasad Sankaran, who joined us yesterday. He's got a very strong background in cloud as well. So he and I spent a great deal of time talking about where that market is going. And ironically, in the client Advisory Board last week, it was a great topic of discussion amongst [indiscernible] clients, too. . I would say our position with some of the packaged application players like Salesforce, Workday is stronger than it's been for many, many years. And so we feel good about the progress there. And yesterday's announcements of OneSource Virtual, we'll continue to strengthen our Workday practice. Vis-a-vis the hyperscalers, it's kind of interesting. I'm seeing clients clearly accelerate their path to the cloud. Within the same vein, Rod, I see a growing dialogue amongst clients around how to optimize your position in the cloud as in lifting and shifting your current suite of applications [indiscernible] refactoring or another way transforming ahead of the transition. It doesn't necessarily always give them the efficiencies that they would have anticipated. So there's more dialogue around how to optimize your cloud journey.  And so what you'll see us do and continue to do is stand up capabilities and resources behind that, both in the cloud practice as well as in our consulting business as we anticipate cloud modernization journeys or tech more generally, you'll see us add more advisory capabilities there as well. So look, the first thing on a broader macroeconomic environment, I'd say it's difficult to be conclusive or dogmatic at this moment in time. It's certainly what we determine uncertain macroeconomic environment. And the outlook is a little more concerning now than it was 3 months ago if you go back to my comments back then. We are seeing spend being reduced in lower priority projects or those with longer ROI periods. And even discretionary cloud projects, as I referenced in my prepared remarks, are selectively being reduced. So we still have a lot of confidence in our digital capabilities. Our portfolio is now 51%, digital up 2 points year-over-year. But some of the challenges we talked about, the macro demand picture as well as the U.S. onshore situation are equally applicable to this. And then as you know, yesterday's announcement of acquisition -- the first acquisition we've done this year. So we haven't had the tailwind in our digital momentum that we had last year from the series of acquisitions that we did. That being said, as Jan pointed out, we are committed to our framework of extending our portfolio in line with our digital strategy, and we have a series of deals in the pipeline as we speak.  So I'd expect that ultimately over time to get back in a more normal course for us. But I don't believe that all digital projects will be immune from the current economic climate. Yes. And just to build on that, the resignations visibility we have, of course, differs in India versus North America because the notification period in India is slightly different. But I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call had July resignations have come down, and through August and September, it was a different plateau for those 3 months vis-a-vis the prior 6 months.  Certainly, if you look at India and indeed in North America and Europe, and in the first month of this quarter, it's continued to be low, in fact, lower than the prior 3 months. So we feel, Bryan, at this stage, very, very confident about that. And as Jan rightly pointed out, we wanted to give guidance that we want to make sure we can hit. So we're in the right zone. We're aiming. As I said on the -- in my prepared remarks, we're working through that as quickly as we can, and we aim to make progress in Q4, but I think it'll still be a headwind in Q4. We hope by the time we come out of Q4, and we'll clearly give you an update on that in next quarter's earnings call, we hope to walk into Q1 with clear progress by the time we get through Q1. We actually see different stories, to be honest, Brian, across different industries in terms of our evolution towards digital, even banking where we are, let's say, more heavily exposed to time and materials. We have been able to increase our digital mix, and we've got some good proof points with certain clients. But more fundamentally, the journey we've been on is to extend the portfolio, which we've been successfully doing in recent years, and yesterday's announcement is another example of that.  To try to complement that portfolio then with a client-facing team that is more consultative in nature as anybody who's overseen a sales force and knows that is a multiyear journey. So we're en route, but it takes time to get there.  To complement then that more consultative sales force with a more industry-aligned consulting business, and so that's the space we should continue to watch in Cognizant because we will invest behind that, and we've got strong leaders in the capacity these days and then just to make sure that there's increasing brand awareness around the capabilities we have and references and case studies that we can showcase.  Last week in the Client Advisory Board was a very good example of certain clients not really been truly aware of the extent of our portfolio. So we have [Technical Difficulty] ourself. But I would say brand awareness of the company is up. Digital awareness is increasing, but it's a multiyear journey, and we're in the middle of all of that. And it starts with our client-facing teams and our delivery capabilities and our partnerships. And I certainly see in dialogue, with some of our key packaged application partners like Salesforce and SAP, growing recognition that we are getting stronger. But as ever, a few years ago, we were quite low in terms of digital mix, and we've been working our way back up to 50%, which we're pleased to cross, but there's more work to do. I think it's very hard to really be precise on that, Bryan. There's just so much going on in today's world. We've gone through a period of pretty significant disconnect between demand supply on key labor -- key digital skills. We're going through a hybrid work environment as a society where, arguably, people are less entrenched or engaged with companies as they work remotely. And now we've gone through a very different scenario that the economy is uncertain, slowing. And people are -- recruiters have been laid off across the globe. We're seeing in certain companies, people are being laid off. And so the market is suddenly perhaps less hot than it was previously. And that can also have an immediate impact on attrition trends and voluntary resignations in particular.  So we will see where water find its own level over time. I'm encouraged by our specific actions that we've taken. Jan and I have also built that into our financial plan. So we have, notwithstanding a slowing, I would say, labor markets, we know that we want to invest on a sustainable basis in our employees in the years to come, and we factored that into our multiyear financial framework, and that will help increase our relative compensation vis-a-vis peers. And simultaneously, we're doing everything we can around training and development and career path and employee value proposition.  So I'm not sure when it normalizes to a new norm. I still believe there will be a new norm, and we won't go back to historical levels. And I think as a society at large, we'll probably see attrition slow across the industry in Q4 and beyond. But time will tell. Yes. I mean there's -- it's actually quite nuanced because, first of all, our headcount has materially increased year-over-year, but most of the increase has been in India. So by definition, then you have different bill rates. Within India, the lower levels of our pyramid are actually a fatter for lack of a better word than they were in the last few years. And that's because if you go back this year, we'll bring in about 40,000 graduates, 45,000 last year, 33,000 the year before, about 17,000 the year, less than 10,000. We had been too narrow as a period previously. We've done a good job, I think, addressing that. And that afforded us the opportunity to have more upward momentum in the company, which is one of the many factors that has helped us actually drive margin expansion year-over-year and sequentially in both Q2 and Q3.  And -- but James, the fundamental element in terms of the demand supply economic imbalance and key digital scales was heavily related to skills related to all hyperscalers, things like Salesforce, [indiscernible] full stack engineers. I mean they've been probably the hottest parts of the market and there's been very irrational behavior, I would argue, over the last 18 months in terms of comp increases that went in, in glove with that. That's where we've seen the hottest challenges. In terms of the absolute attrition, it's fundamentally been in India and at the lower levels of the pyramid. Yes. The only thing I would add there, Tien-Tsin, is I don't think we were doing anything except correcting what was an overly narrow pyramid back in the day. And on the contrary, I think because we had somewhat canceled the college intake in prior years, it led us having folks further up the pyramid doing work at lower billable rates than were optimal.  So I think what we've done in India is appropriate, and it's more in line with industry rates based on the dialogue I have with those from other companies. Where we have to do a better job on campus and college graduates, I think, is both onshore in Europe and Asia as well as in North America, where we are not adequately getting after the market opportunity there. It's -- obviously, there is a war on talent still. So we have to look at vocational colleges and not just the classic places as well, and that's an area of focus we'll have.  Fortunately, with Ravi coming on board in North America, he has run a play there previously, which we will obviously aim to replicate over here. And that can help our pyramid. But generally, I feel good about our skills in our pyramid. I think we corrected something that was mis-skewed. And I don't want anybody to get off the call worried about our skill set in our pyramid where we've got very talented employees, and I feel good about that. Yes. Look, it's a good question. I mean I'll start with the 2 bigger ones, Financial Services, which is about 31% of the company. It grew about 1.6 points in constant currency, but that was impacted by the exit of the Samlink business, which was previously disclosed to the tune of 180 basis points to normalize, let's say, 3.4 points of growth. And that's the low industry. We've got a lot of work to do there, as we've cited previously. . There is a slowdown in certain segments there we've touched upon in the prepared remarks, the mortgage segment in particular. I'm also seeing some of the C-suite there talking about, let's say, tightening their belts as they go into the fourth quarter and beyond. So I think that will be a tougher sector for others as well.  But fundamentally, our bigger issue there that we're evolving from, it's not just the folks we have in front of those clients, but also how the clients think of us. We've very often trained them to think of us as a provider of resources. I'm pleased to say that our digital mix in Financial Services is improving, and our staff -- or time and material mix is not improving enough yet. So we have to get that balance right in the period to come.  Insurance, we're doing better than banking, and that's obviously in banking area we've got to go fix. In Health Services, we feel very good about our position on a relative basis or a competitive basis in both payer provider as well as life sciences. That's one of our core franchises, I would say, as a company. The business grew about 5.5% in constant currency year-over-year. It's 29% of our business. So it's catching up on Financial Services overall. We've had good momentum in the [indiscernible] business in the last few years. So I feel pretty good about our relative position there.  And then if I talk about the other 2 portions of the business where we have actually historically in the last 2 years, 3 years, been growing double digits, CMT is a good success story of ours. We've had good client acquisition there, good constant currency growth.  Products and Resources, I think we have a lot of room to continue to do well there because our penetration of large accounts is lower there than it is as an example in life sciences, or indeed, the payer business where we are heavily penetrated into the major players. So that's kind of how I think about the framework.  The factors we touched upon today, elevated attrition across the industry and Cognizant, within that permeated across all industry segments, and indeed, the U.S. onshore situation permeated across all as well. So nothing specific to either of those."

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 revenue was below our guidance range, driven primarily by lower billable headcount in North America. Higher-than-expected attrition, coupled with strong competition for talent in North America, made it challenging for us to maintain required staffing levels to meet our revenue forecast. An uncertain macroeconomic backdrop led to pockets of bookings and revenue weaknesses in certain industries.  The weaker-than-expected revenue performance was offset by commercial discipline, the benefit from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and SG&A leverage, which resulted in sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansion.  Now moving on to the details for the quarter. Q3 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 2.4% year-over-year or 5.6% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 40 basis points of growth from our acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed at the beginning of this year.  In Q3, digital revenue as reported grew 7% year-over-year or 11% at constant currency. Digital represented approximately 51% of total revenue for the quarter, up 2 points from the prior year period. Our slower digital revenue growth reflected the expected lower inorganic contribution we discussed last quarter and the lower billable headcount in North America mentioned earlier.  These factors and softening demand environment also contributed to a bookings performance below our expectations. Q3 bookings declined 2% year-over-year and represented an in-period book-to-bill of approximately 1x. This resulted in a trailing 12-month bookings of $23.1 million and a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x, unchanged from Q2.  Brian has already taken us through the segment performance, but I will spend a minute discussing several trends we are seeing emerge across our 2 largest segments. Within Financial Services, banking revenue growth slowed this quarter. This portfolio has a higher mix of time and material business, which we believe is more vulnerable to changes in the economic outlook of our clients.  Additionally, mortgage clients have been impacted by rising interest rates, which has a negative impact on our results. These headwinds were offset by continued growth within insurance, particularly within property and casualty, where we are seeing good traction in both middle market and large global carriers.  We're continuing to invest and strengthen our banking and financial services portfolio to improve the revenue trajectory over the medium term. Within Health Science, our growth was again driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Health care payer growth was consistent with last quarter, and we have seen the ramp-up of integration-related services following the software product growth earlier this year. However, the health care industry has not been immune to pressures driven by the macro uncertainty as we have seen softer demand both across health care payer and life sciences.  Clients are slowing discretionary spending as they await greater clarity on the economy and navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment. Continuing with the year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue grew 4%. Growth was led by CMT and Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which consists of all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 10%, including a negative 220 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was again led by the U.K., up 19%, which had a strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients.  Now moving on to margins. In Q3, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 16.4% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, GAAP operating margin increased by 100 basis points, and adjusted operating margin increased by basis points. Year-over-year, margin expansion was primarily driven by SG&A leverage, while gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs was partially offset by delivering efficiencies and disciplined pricing. We also experienced a meaningful tailwind from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, delivering an approximate 80 basis points of benefit, net of hedges year-over-year.  Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which included the benefit from a discrete tax item in the quarter. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.2%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.22, and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.17, up 18% and 10% year-over-year, respectively.  Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.7 billion or net cash of $2.1 billion. Free cash flow in Q3 was $953 million, representing approximately 150% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $1.6 billion or 92% of net income. DSO of 74 days was flat sequentially and increased by 2 days year-over-year.  During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to approximately $1.5 billion through the first 9 months of 2022.  Turning to our forward outlook. We are revising our full year guidance downward, which reflects headwinds from currency, lower North America billable headcount, which we expect to take several quarters to improve, and softer-than-expected bookings growth. Offsetting these factors are several tailwinds, including sustained reductions in resignations globally and our expectation for lower attrition in the fourth quarter.  For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $4.72 billion to $4.77 billion, representing year-over-year decline of 0.2% to 1.2% or growth of 2% to 3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 320 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 30 basis points.  Together, these factors contribute to our revised full year revenue guidance of approximately $19.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 4.5% or 7% in constant currency. This assumes approximately 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative basis points of impact from currency versus 220 basis points previously. This compares to our prior full year revenue guidance of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, which represented growth of 6.3% to 7.3% or 8.5% to 9.5% in constant currency.  We expect our full year operating margin to be approximately 15.6% at the low end of our prior range. This implies Q4 adjusted operating margin of around 15.3% at the midpoint of our EPS range, reflecting the reduced revenue outlook and the annual merit cycle for most employees that is effective October 1.  Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $50 million versus $35 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. We still expect average shares outstanding of approximately $519 million, unchanged. Our tax guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged.  Finally, our revised full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.43 to $4.46 represents growth of approximately 7% to 8%. This compares to prior guidance of $4.51 to $4.57. Our longer-term capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We are pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the professional services and application management practices of OneSource Virtual yesterday, and we expect our acquisition pipelines to remain active. Our share repurchase assumption for the full year is unchanged at $1.2 billion. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors.  In support of our balanced capital deployment strategy, the Board has also approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, which brings our total remaining authorization to over $3 billion as of today. We are also still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.  Before opening the call for questions, I want to reinforce that the leadership team is focused on addressing the operational challenges impacting our recent results. We are also closely monitoring macroeconomic factors to help enable us to quickly respond to changes in the demand environment. Longer term, we remain confident in our market opportunity.  With that, we will open the call for your questions. And maybe in addition, Ashwin, to give you a little bit more the framework on the M&A side, our full year guidance assumes approximately 100 basis points of contribution from M&A, approximately half of what we typically see. So if you multiply that types of share of digital revenues, you'll see there is an impact on just mathematically on the lack of M&A fueling digital growth.  And then aside from the demand -- market demand that Brian mentioned, obviously, in North America, we are also affected by our fulfillment challenges that we experienced in the quarter, which proportionately affected our non-digital business as well as our digital business. So it's a combination of all these factors together. Yes. So that somehow I thought the question would come up. So number one is we feel our growth framework that we discussed with you in basically pretty much a year ago -- a little bit more than a year ago, it's still intact overall.  Maybe a few pointers, the growth framework sees our revenue growth, which you're referring to, really in light of a CAGR over the 3-year time horizon. So it's a compounding growth. And obviously, we didn't quite anticipate at that point the economic uncertainty that we're facing today, but we think the framework from our perspective is intact. And then we will give guidance, obviously, for next year in our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Yes. Maybe I'll start with it, and then I'll let Brian jump on top of it. If we think about the mix, as Brian mentioned and as we talked on our call, had a number of factors in it in fulfillment as fairly logical. So we misjudged or we had a little bit -- a faster improvement in the third quarter of our attrition anticipated. And so about that, that miss attrition improvement made about 1/3 of our miss relative to our expectations.  And then we have a number of initiatives in place to accelerate the hiring and inflow, in particular, in North America of initiatives. And that represents approximately also 1/3 of our miss to revenue guidance. And here, we obviously saw the North American challenge to grow our headcount and initiatives in place from funding our -- and ensuring we have full capacity of hiring in place to focusing on the full fledge of resources available to us, including the utilization of subcontractors and accelerating visa travel and increasing employee referral product. So we have a set of initiatives in place. These initiatives have shown initial momentum, but they were scaling slower than we anticipated.  So we have now our trajectory, and we think we have appropriately risk-adjusted our new revenue guidance. So we're keenly interested to meet our own expectations in it. And so yes, we have assumed an improvement in attrition levels that we can see. But we also see now the trajectories of some of these initiatives clearer than we had in the third quarter. Yes. That's maybe for me to answer. So effectively, our acceleration of our typical merit cycle that we're just experiencing in the fourth quarter and moving it up to the second quarter has really -- a main reason for it is to better align our HR processes, evaluation processes and reward processes together. So it is a benefit from a talent management perspective to have our merit increase in the second quarter. So that's really a very important driver of it.  And second important driver is obviously because we're accelerating the second -- this merit cycle by 2 quarters, we will incur a onetime shift of compensation by -- to our merit increase by 2 quarters forward. And that's going to be a onetime effect only because we're staying with an annual merit increase process. So in 2024, the normal cycle will be 4 quarters later again in the second quarter of the year.  So we are capturing basically, I think, here an opportunity to improve our talent management processes, but also allows -- which also allows us to drive a faster compensation increase to our associates, which we think is timely because we really do want to be focused on attrition, and we anticipate that, that will have a positive impact on attrition, even though hard to measure, but we think it will send a positive signal of our commitment to our associates to be competitive on compensation and benefits. So what we -- maybe I'll talk a little bit about our overall maybe gross margin development, kind of what you're focusing on, Tien-Tsin, here is we did see, obviously, a decline, but I think the relative performance overall compared to the [indiscernible] has been relatively good.  And so a few factors I want to point out. When we talk about pricing, I think we need to kind of -- in particular, now that we have been added for a little while, think about them as a regular contractual increase, pricing increases with our clients, but also a discipline to price our business appropriately in the market. And with both of these things, we have seen slow start in the fiscal year. And now we have seen steady improvement and compounding impact of those initiatives. So that has been getting better and has helped us on the relative gross margin performance.  Also, the shift to the -- in our pyramid has been positive. We have been able to, to a large degree, offset the impact of comp and benefit increases by streamlining our pyramid and focusing on a slimmer permit, as mentioned, and that paired this promotion opportunities, which are positive, our associates, I think, we'll have over the next couple of years, as that is still scaling and maturing, a positive impact on how we price and how we win deals.  So we're feeling, I think, good -- well, we're feeling good about the improvements we're making of how we manage the business opportunities. It's a thoughtful process. It allows us actually also to make our strategic best moving forward. I think our margin profile is in good shape, and that should offer us opportunities to make our strategic bets where we want to go and grow faster revenues on a much more solid base than we are today. Yes. For this fiscal year, we gave you basically our anticipated number of $1.2 billion. And you see over the last few quarters as we have been lacking M&A activities that we basically redirected excess cash to return to our shareholders. That's the general philosophy that we've been following with no intent to build up cash on our balance sheet. And so that flexibility is in the model. We are seeing a good pipeline, though, of our M&A activity. So it's -- this we announced the deal, but compared to last quarter, we really moved the needle forward on our business development activity with very talented team. And we see also, I think, a little bit more realistic behavior in the market relative to acquisition opportunities.  So I think for us, the goal would be to get back to normal to the capital allocation framework that we have been talking about for a long time. It's going to be the mindset for us going forward. The -- well, I have to say and answer in the third quarter, we gave guidance in the fourth quarter. But I did mention that we feel our overall framework -- our multiyear framework is intact, and that didn't refer only to the revenue, but it refers also to our margin expectations. So that's kind of as far as I want to go for today.  We -- when you analyze the results on the margin, I think it's important to consider a number of factors. We have driven the margin expansion by having SG&A control and discipline. So it helped us to drive and leverage that SG&A as the company grew. We had also meaningful support from the depreciation of the rupee in our business.  And then I talked already about the impact that our actions had on gross margin. Gross margin was under pressure, but I think we had a lot of activity that moderated at what could have been a bigger effect on gross margin even.  So you heard me in the third quarter and continue -- and second quarter and now continues in the third quarter, we feel we have a relatively -- we have a good process in place to balance that business out. So our focus is to maintain that discipline, obviously, and then really accelerate revenue growth. That is the main focus that we're driving on because that's our biggest opportunity and use this -- the margin profile as a great foundation for that."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. You may begin your presentation.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2022 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures or appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Humphries: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to comment on several topics today, notably our second quarter performance, the demand and pricing environment and labor market dynamics. Let's start with our second quarter performance, which was balanced. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by digital. Second quarter operating margin was 15.5%, up 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations. Financial leverage driven by sequential revenue growth, disciplined expense management, currency benefits and the optimization of pyramid, shoring and fulfillment helped offset the impact of attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. Our industry segment performance remained largely consistent. Financial Services grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency, led by insurance growth. This includes a negative impact of 190 basis points from the exit of Samlink. We continue to make progress strengthening client relationships in Financial Services. Earlier in the second quarter, I visited clients in Germany and celebrated a new logo win with Zurich Insurance Germany. Cognizant will help them simplify, modernize and manage their enterprise application landscape by establishing joint DevOps teams and working to extend the insurers' AI, data, software engineering and cloud capabilities. In insurance, CCC Intelligent Solutions whose SaaS platform powers the property and casualty insurance industry, asked for our help in enabling their cloud transformation program. We led with our enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation consultancy and partnered with Microsoft to present a comprehensive solution. This prompted the client to also select us to build next-generation analytics and telematics solutions that are expected to be key to their long-term leadership. In the second quarter, we combined our Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments into a single operating segment called Health Sciences and naturally dilution, given the market conversions across these industries. Health Sciences grew 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency, with growth driven by pharmaceutical clients and sustained momentum in our TriZetto product portfolio. Commonwealth Care Alliance, an integrated care system serving over 60,000 members across numerous U.S. states, illustrates our momentum in TriZetto. Our end-to-end business process innovation powered by TriZetto solutions and a BPaaS engagement is fully integrated from enrollment and billing through claims. Through our partnership, Commonwealth Care now has the tools needed to compete in the digital health ecosystem and support value-based personalized care for its members. We've also signed a new multiyear agreement with Organon, a global women's health company to help improve the delivery of healthcare products and crucial medicinal supply chain management. We'll help Organon scale its healthcare business by delivering full stack industrial technology support for its global pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Indonesia. We continue to see excellent growth in Products and Resources, where revenue grew 11.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven in part by strength among automotive, logistics, retail and consumer goods clients. As a strategic partner for digital, we're helping Albertsons Companies, a $70 billion grocery retailer, make their move to a cloud-based infrastructure model, enabling innovation and improved customer experiences, both in-store and across last-mile delivery. In Communications, Media and Technology, we had another quarter of excellent growth. Revenue grew 19.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by technology clients and new client acquisition. DocuSign is an example of a new logo win. They selected Cognizant as the preferred partner for global customer support operations across all products and services from their flagship e-signature product to newer contract life cycle management products. DocuSign turned to us because of the distinctive solution proposed by our intuitive operations and automation practice, including cutting-edge omnichannel customer support and outcome-based commercial models. A quick word on our recently announced organizational evolution. In July, we announced the combination of our practice areas with delivery practices, which simplifies our model by bringing Cognizant in line with industry norms. This enables us to have end-to-end accountability across 4 integrated practices from vision, road map offerings and capabilities, including M&A and post-merger integration through to presale solutioning and delivery. I believe this will assist our industry teams to be more successful with our clients as we sell solution and deliver client outcomes. I also believe that our industry capabilities provide differentiation that we can unlock value for clients at the intersection of industry use cases and technology. Moving now to the demand and pricing environment. While we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of a worsening economy in our pipeline, to date, we've not seen any significant slowdown for IT services demand. That said, as we serve some of the largest clients in the world, we are aware that should they see slowing earnings growth, nonessential projects or those with longer ROI may be paused. I am confident that the breadth of our portfolio enables us to serve our clients' needs for higher levels of agility, innovation, resilience and indeed, efficiency. So regardless of what the coming quarters bring, our value proposition to clients remains. More generally, digital transformation has become so essential and foundational to most companies, regardless of their industry, that despite some macro demand uncertainty in the short term, I remain optimistic on IT services' growth prospects in the medium to long term. In fact, the bigger challenges we are faced with as an industry are the demand supply and balance on key digital skills, elevated attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. I would like to thank our associates around the world who've been working hard to navigate these challenges, all whilst trying to optimize fulfillment and pricing. Achieving the perfect balance is not always easy. And in the second quarter, while I'm pleased that we drove both year-over-year and sequential margin expansion, I suspect that our focus on fulfillment optimization and pricing marginally impacted top line performance and hurt bookings momentum. Second quarter bookings declined 3% year-over-year, below our assumptions entering the quarter. While we continue to have a robust book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, by better balancing the factors just mentioned, we aim to accelerate bookings growth in other quarters, whilst nonetheless achieving our committed margin expansion. Just a word now on pricing. Market pricing dynamics remain consistent. Clients, through their vendor exposure and their internal teams, are privy to demand supply and balances across key digital skills and labor cost inflationary pressure. This, coupled with the pent-up demand for digital transformation, means clients are more predisposed to engage in price increase discussions. Clients are willing to pay for skills and innovation, with efficiencies, including automation and optimized delivery mix, are expected to mitigate cost increases. We continue to execute against a pricing initiative to offset labor cost inflationary pressure, with benefits starting to be felt, but greater impact expected in the coming quarters, recognizing that pricing power stemming from talent shortages will lag behind talent-related cost increases. Let's move now to labor market dynamics, including attrition and inflationary pressure. Second quarter voluntary attrition rose 5 points to 31% on an annualized basis or 32% on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase was slightly above the seasonal uptick we anticipated entering the quarter, impacting second quarter revenue performance. While we have seen some signs of improvement in July resignation rates, we continue to expect elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. As I've mentioned on prior calls, attracting, retaining and rallying our talented employees is one of our top priorities. In the past year, we've invested record levels in compensation, overhauled our promotion process, invested heavily in our learning and development initiatives and introduced a series of other measures, including educational programs and returnships. Our internal job moves program, which facilitates ongoing upward mobility in the company, is one factor that enables us to mitigate the need for and deep the cost pressure of lateral hires, all whilst improving morale. We've also recognized how important flexibility is to our associates and have, therefore, communicated a hybrid model will define our approach to work. Our priority is to be a welcoming inclusive, equitable company for everyone in no matter their work location. Our clients and associate-centric company aims to strike a balance between how clients want to interact with us and the flexibility we seek, all while maintaining a focus on employee engagement, collaboration, our values and a culture of continuous learning. I'm pleased to see that our efforts on employee engagement are working. In recent weeks, we completed our annual engagement survey that showed significant increases in our engagement scores, positioning us above industry benchmarks. In closing, as we execute our strategy, we were operating with 3 clear priorities: first, execute our vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite; second, rally and engage our associates around the world; and third, drive profitable growth. Despite some near-term macro demand uncertainty and the challenges of navigating today's labor markets, let's not forget that we are in -- at the early stages of what we expect to be a massive digital build-out. Thanks to our portfolio and our talented employees around the world, we believe that we will be a strategic beneficiary as companies embrace digital operating models. Finally, as we reposition Cognizant towards selling, solutioning and delivering industry-aligned solutions, enabled by targeted advisory capabilities, our margin potential will be strengthened in line with our brand repositioning to higher-value services. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While our Q2 revenue growth was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, we delivered sequential margin expansion in line with our expectations, while continuing to invest into our talented people. We remain focused on profitable revenue growth. Moving on to results. Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9.5% at constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q2, digital revenue, as reported, grew 13% year-over-year and included FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points, consistent with the total company. At quarter end, digital represented approximately 50% of total revenue, up 3 points from the prior year period. In addition to the FX headwinds, slowing of digital growth reflected lower inorganic contribution and elevated attrition, in particular, in North America. Despite these headwinds, we were pleased with the growth across our digital battlegrounds, which outpaced the total digital growth. As Brian mentioned, Q2 bookings declined 3% year-over-year. This resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.2 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2, unchanged from Q1. Despite the softer-than-expected growth, we continue to believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our revenue growth outlook for 2022. We expect to improve bookings growth in the quarters ahead. Moving on to segment results for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%. Q2 growth included a negative 190 basis points impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. Our recovery within financial services remains largely in line with our expectation, driven by continued strength in our North America regional banking portfolio, growth in the UK and steady performance within insurance globally. Health Sciences revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Demand among healthcare clients was consistent with last quarter. Momentum continued in our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 12%, driven by growth across all segments and included approximately 260 basis points contribution from recently completed acquisitions. This compares to the approximately 500 basis points contribution we reported in Q1 of this year. Based on the current portfolio of closed acquisitions, we expect the inorganic contribution to be immaterial to segment performance beginning in Q3. Communications, Media & Technology or CMT revenue grew approximately 20%, primarily organically, including growth from new clients. This reflects growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients. We also continue to experience strong demand for our intuitive operations and automation services, which includes our BPO business. From a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth was led by CMT and Life Sciences clients. Our global growth markets, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 12% year-over-year in constant currency, which included a negative 240 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was led again by the UK, which grew 25% and included strong double-digit growth within financial services, including public sector science, Products and Resources and CMT. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth in our GGM business and do not believe that we are hitting our full potential yet. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin increased by approximately 30 basis points, in line with our expectations. This included improvement in gross margin, driven in part by a balanced execution and our focus on profitable revenue growth. We also experienced a benefit from the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and a modest benefit from our recent pricing initiatives. Additionally, we were pleased with the SG&A leverage we drove in the quarter. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.2%, and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.2%, which benefited from a discrete tax benefit related to our unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings, driven by the depreciation of the rupee. Q2 Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.11, and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 14% and 18% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q2 was $485 million, representing approximately 84% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $671 million. DSO of 74 days increased by 2 days sequentially, driven in part by seasonality and by 3 days year-over-year. We expect to improve DSO in the second half of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to over $1 billion through the first half of 2022. Turning to guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes that we will continue to balance margin performance and revenue growth. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.98 billion to $5.03 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% or 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 50 basis points, which reflects the lower-than-anticipated M&A activity compared with our assumptions in prior full year guidance. For the full year, we are lowering the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth guidance by about 1 point, which reflects, in part, the impact we have had while navigating the current industry supply-demand imbalances, elevated attrition and softer-than-expected hiring, particularly in North America. However, we are maintaining our margin expansion guidance, which reflects prioritization of profitable growth, pricing initiatives and the rigor that we have put around SG&A. Our full year revenue, we still expect inorganic growth to contribute approximately 100 basis points to growth, unchanged from prior guidance. This assumes an immaterial contribution from future unannounced acquisitions in Q4. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 220 basis points impact from currency versus 180 basis points previously. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance in the range of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing 6.3% to 7.3% growth or 8.5% to 9.5% growth in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion, which represented growth of 7.2% to 9.2% or 9% to 11% in constant currency. Our longer-term capital allocation framework is unchanged. Today's uncertain macroeconomic backdrop has the potential to create a mismatch of valuation expectations between buyers and sellers as well as challenging synergy assumptions. Despite these dynamics, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce deals towards the end of this year. However, these factors have led us to deploy less capital than anticipated on M&A. Therefore, we are revising our capital allocation plans for the remainder of 2022. We now expect to return at least $1.2 billion through share repurchases for the full year, up from our commitment of at least $600 million last quarter. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors. Given the strength of our balance sheet and expected free cash flow generation, we do not expect liquidity will restrict our ability to execute against our M&A pipeline for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints, the elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margins include increased compensation costs, C&E and a return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. Our guidance assumes continued sequential margin expansion in Q3 before the impact of our annual merit cycle in Q4. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $35 million versus $25 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. Based on our increased share repurchase activity, we now expect average shares outstanding of approximately 519 million versus 522 million shares previously. We also now expect a tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% to 26%, reflecting lower year-to-date performance. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.51 to $4.57, up approximately 9% to 11% year-over-year. This compares to $4.45 to $4.55 previously. Finally, we are still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research.\nRod Bourgeois : On the revenue progress and outlook, you've provided some updates here for us. How much of the revenue challenge versus the plan that you had 3 months ago and even earlier this year, how much of that is due to supply challenges? It sounds like a lot of it is supply versus macro challenges that are being faced within your client base and potential that the macro challenges are starting to ramp up.\nBrian Humphries : Rod, it's Brian here. Thanks for the question. Look, it's very much related to more towards the demand supply and balance that we see in the market. We gave guidance in November around the revenue target range of 8 to 11 over the coming years with about 2 points from M&A. Today, we reported 9.5 points of growth, so within that range. And even the guidance we gave is within that range. But my hope obviously, is that with better demand supply situation Cognizant would have better headcount and be better able to get after the revenue opportunity, whilst also I feel pretty good about where we are on margin these days. So really for us now is about getting -- continuing to evolve the business portfolio, if you will, to higher growth categories, making sure we get the headcount right, both in terms of increasing retention and making sure we even get better throughput in terms of our recruitment. And then, of course, targeted M&A, which tends to be accretive to our revenue CAGR, some targeted larger deals that may or may not come ultimately, in years to come. But we'll be selective on those, as I've always said. And in some regards, today's margin profile, I think, is also indicative of the fact that in recent years, we haven't made big bets that may have been wrong in terms of attrition assumptions or margin or cost assumptions. So it's really about those things, Rod. Macro, we've seen some impact in terms of pipeline progression but it's been more modest. We haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of slowdown in demand, and I'm still certainly of the opinion that's while we'll have to keep an eye on the earnings cycle of our major clients and understand how they think about larger projects or ERP rollouts or projects with ROI time lines. At the end of the day, I'm very optimistic about IT services growth prospects in the medium to long term, and we'll continue to shape the portfolio to make sure we were able to show up and add value to clients.\nRod Bourgeois : Okay. Well, that's helpful. That demand is not being significantly impacted, it sounds like by macro. On pricing, you made some comments on pricing. And just to follow up on that, are you feeling that your pricing progress is consistent with the expectations that you had 3 and 6 months ago? Or is the macro factors also creating more challenges in getting prices realized?\nJan Siegmund : Yes. Rod, I'll jump in. The pricing environment, we would still overall characterize as consistent, and we feel we do have pricing opportunities for us that we are realizing and working hard to achieve. We see better opportunities in our digital opportunities where the demand is really difficult to supply and value is high, our new digital type services as we see better opportunities we talked in last quarter about our initiatives to drive pricing across our entire client portfolio. And we're making progress. We always anticipated that this would be a multi-quarter endeavor. Some of these negotiations are ongoing, but we do see early results, and that's why I mentioned in my commentary that we do see some modest contribution from pricing, not only to margin, but obviously, to our overall margin development.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg : Just wanted to switch over to bookings. I know you mentioned they were below your expectations for the quarter. Wondering if you can quantify the shortfall there? And maybe just talk about what you think some of the root causes might have been. Obviously, they can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but I'm guessing that the bookings are kind of less affected by the supply-demand imbalances that you just talked about as it relates to revenue. So I would just like to get a little bit more color there? And do we start to see improvement in the bookings growth trajectory in Q3?\nBrian Humphries: Jason, it's Brian. So you said it right, bookings can be choppy, which is why I've always been an advocate of looking at bookings on a rolling 12-month basis. So on a trailing 12-month basis, our bookings are still quite strong with a book-to-bill of 1.2. But within any given quarter, you'll have dynamics at play. And this was a quarter where we knew we had to go focus on resource fulfillment, given where we were from an attrition and resource point of view, but also we wanted to make sure, given labor inflationary trends, we were able to address pricing discussions with clients. And that may have had even a psychological impact on our commercial team as they are focused on fulfillment and focus on pricing discussions, and perhaps concerned about selling the next thing if they're worried about being able to fulfill against it. So it's not quite as clean as you suggested. But fundamentally, we'd expect this to pick up in Q3 and Q4. Demand is there to the question that Rod asked earlier. We feel pretty good about our portfolio these days. We are repositioning the brand and repositioning how Cognizant shows up to clients and the kind of work we want to engage in. So it's maybe a question of balance. That's perhaps the word of this quarter's earnings. We're very proud that we're an outlier in the industry in the sense that we were able to drive margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We obviously want to accompany that with revenue growth and bookings momentum, and that's what we're setting out to achieve, obviously, on a go-forward basis.\nJason Kupferberg : And then just on the supply side, is attrition or is hiring the bigger challenge right now? And do you think Q2 will, more or less, be the peak on attrition? I know you said you expect it to remain elevated, but just wondering what other actions the company might take to improve that metric?\nBrian Humphries : We've taken significant actions from an attrition point of view, both in terms of compensation, significant investments in career path and overall our promotion process, significant investments in learning and development, and then in a whole host of other activities around education, returnships and whatnot. I will say there are some opportunities here that we have. This is seasonally in line with, I guess, expectations, although it was a little above what we had assumed going into the quarter. But we are somewhat confident that the actions we're taking are really kicking in. Employee engagement, as I suggested in my prepared remarks showed increases year-over-year across all 8 categories that we measured and were above industry benchmarks by the way. We have seen progress in terms of the actions we've been taking in the last 18 months. It has really improved our relative compensation position across key markets, including India. And while it's only 1 month of the quarter, the resignation trends we've seen in July, which isn't just about Q3, it's also about Q4, have been improving. And we have good success on this internal job moves program, which is creating a much more dynamic promotion process. So those are good leading indicators, I'd say, in terms of retention. On the recruitment side, I think it's fair to say the industry has been faced with almost its musical chair situation, where people show up with multiple job offers. The macro dynamics may actually start becoming more favorable. Early indications are that offer to join, our ratios have recovered a little bit in recent weeks, and I dare say, for us, perhaps for others as well. So we're looking forward to hopefully being able to build our headcount more aggressively on a go-forward basis and therefore, be able to achieve our true top line potential on the back of increased operational rigor and margin discipline that we've\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : I know Jason asked about your confidence or visibility on bookings improving. But just thinking about your headcount changes a little bit here, it did slow down quite a bit sequentially after a period of strength. So just trying to read into that as I'm assuming you're just going to focus a little bit more on utilization here at this point of the cycle? Just trying to reconcile those two things.\nJan Siegmund : Yes. Maybe just as a quick reminder, our second quarter is typically a higher attrition quarter that has to do with some of the bonus payments that we issue in the end of March. So we knew that we would have increased attrition that we don't expect to continue throughout the year. So that's number one. It does -- it did turn out to be a little bit higher, maybe also for the revenue impact that we identified, it had -- it did tick up a little bit higher and a little bit more impact in North America than the core of our operation in India. So from a medium-term perspective, I would think we still have elevated attrition levels, although not at the level that we have seen in the second quarter.\nBrian Humphries : The other thing I'd just add to that as well is, of course, all headcount is not the same. We've seen a shift of our delivery to offshore in the last few years. And I think where we have to put a little bit more effort in place is to continue to build our onshore headcount, particularly in North America. We've gone through a pretty extensive effort in the last 3 years to reduce visa dependency in North America. But hand in glove with that, we have to continue to scale campus hiring, lateral hires, -- and obviously, headcounts in North America, well, maybe having a lower margin rate can actually give us more dollars per head on both revenue and indeed gross margin. So that's an important factor as well. But yes, we're all over this, and you can imagine it's got our full attention, both in terms of the recruitment throughput, offer-joiner ratios that we track as well as what we're doing from a retention point of view. Obviously, the employee satisfaction and employee engagement survey results were very pleasing to see. So it's good to see the progress we're making.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Just quickly on -- for my follow-up, the 1.2 book-to-bill being stable. I heard that. But is there a way to look at annualized backlog as well or some other metric thinking about that trend, assuming that there's some short-term project work and maybe some of the bookings have converted? Just on duration or ACV is another metric. I know you don't give it, but any interesting calculations there.\nBrian Humphries : We don't really get into those details, but our average contract duration actually increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Some of that is because we had a little bit more momentum in larger deals, and some of it is because of the situation that in a resource-constrained environment, we were quite selective in terms of the deals that we get after with a view to ultimately aligning our resources in line with our business model evolution. And that business model evolution is around aligning resources to our targeted customer segments, aligned to selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes as opposed to simply being a provider of resources for clients. And if you're simply a provider of resources for clients, you can skew to lower-end deals and being in the mode of staff augmentation. So our strategy informs our actions. And this quarter, obviously, with the cards we had, which was a resource-constrained environment, we obviously had the luxury of being able to make choice points that were both beneficial to our strategic direction as well as beneficial to our margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette : I wanted to ask quickly on the competitive environment. It seems like your strategy that you've characterized as balance seems different or at least to diverge from what we've seen from some of your peers in their early reporting, especially as it relates to share and margin dynamics. Can you just give a little bit more color on how you're thinking about that balance strategy? What's driving that is what -- how you view that to be -- or why you view that to be the appropriate and how you think it plays out from here?\nBrian Humphries : Yes, I'll start. Jan, by all means, jump in if you want to embellish this as well. I think at the end of the day, James, we go back to the multiyear framework we laid out in November, not that long ago at the Analyst Day, when we talked about a revenue CAGR aspiration coupled with margin expansion over multiple years. And I would argue that's still the right way to think about Cognizant. Nothing has fundamentally changed. The results we announced this quarter, 9.5% constant currency growth with significant margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, unlike the rest of the industry, I think fits within that mode and so too does our guidance. Clearly, the more resources we have, the more we'll be able to go on the attack more from a top line perspective. But what we've been really focused on is making sure we put a good operational discipline in place in terms of how we think about pricing, how we think about mix, delivery pyramid, et cetera, that's been a multiyear effort. We've also made investments, by the way, in the company that are starting to the bear fruit now. And of course, we get financial leverage the more we grow sequentially. So it's no -- not really fundamentally different from what we outlined back in November, and that's how you should think about us going forward as well. As we are better able to make progress on our retention trends, we'll have the luxury to be able to hopefully accelerate growth and get the balance a little bit better than this quarter.\nJan Siegmund : Yes. And maybe I'll add the component of the business mix that we have been adding in our growth. We have gotten these questions in past calls. We have been absent from large and mega deals in the past and in the last couple of years. And arguably, that had slow our revenue growth, but it allowed us to much better control our balanced portfolio of the revenue growth within the corridors that we outlined, plus the margin expansion, which is just our fundamental belief will build the compounding, the most quality type business over time.\nJames Faucette : And then can I just ask a follow-up, as you've formulated the outlook, obviously, a lot of moving parts between pricing, attrition, wage inflation as well as the macro itself. Can you give a little bit of color in terms of -- as you formulated that outlook, what of those key components are you expecting to improve as we go through the second half of the year versus steady versus any that -- versus steady that -- or versus any that may you -- you may be looking to do for deterioration?\nJan Siegmund : Yes. Look, I think we are really to -- year-to-date quite close to the path that we had anticipated for the year. So I would point out the trajectory that we definitely look forward to improve is our bookings growth. And obviously, on a relative basis, also our employee attrition because that combination will allow us to drive a revenue growth acceleration basically, within the framework that we have outlined and deliver against our bottom line commitments. So the -- I think those would be the two factors that we'll be working hard. I tried to outline the opportunity that we see is not enterprise-wide unfocused. We can with, focused actions, drive improvements. For example, in my script, I mentioned the North American situation, I think we're going to pay extra attention to drive our North American staffing that will have good revenue impact and will strengthen us. That would be good action. We'll be very careful, encouraging our overall, a lot for revenue growth and bookings throughout our distribution and sales capabilities. And then the rest feels to me is in relatively good shape. We have our SG&A now as we have committed to in a good and controlled environment and we are able to drive that margin balance through this combination. And it is a number of factors that come too, by shifting towards our digital mix, which is accretive to our overall gross margin by making continued progress on our pricing action that will help to drive top line growth and the sustainability of our margin profile. So it's kind of a balance of -- we have kind of the foundations and innovative from my perspective in good shape so that we're now addressing selective areas of improvement for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut : With financial services being your largest vertical, you drilled down into demand trends in financial services in the second quarter across your range of services, digital versus legacy and how you expect demand to evolve in this industry segment in the balance of the year?\nBrian Humphries : Yes. David, it's Brian. Look, I would say no major concerns in terms of demand curves in the financial services sector generally and within banking. We certainly had a good quarter, I would say, in commercial banking, which was stronger than retail and cards and payments and indeed, stronger than capital markets. So what we see there is, frankly, some more of a selective approach from Cognizant as we have repositioned ourselves with some of the larger banks, a shift away from staff augmentation with their transformation programs and really their innovation agenda. So it's been an evolution of how we -- the teams we have in front of clients and what they are about to sell and hopefully solution and deliver, but also educating clients to think about Cognizant differently. But I don't see any fundamental issues in terms of macro concerns in the banking space. Insurance, we seem to have done well in the quarter as well. Generally, most of the vast majority is in the United States. And we had a, I would say, a reasonably strong quarter there, too. And no major concerns either from a macro perspective there.\nJan Siegmund : Maybe I'll just add some obvious things. Keep in mind that the reported results still reflect the impact of our disposition of Samlink, that is about 200 basis points impact on the growth rate. In substantiation of Brian's comments, we do see, for example, digital revenue and revenue shares catching up to our company average and making progress on that mix. Brian gave you the cut by our sectors, we have also regional success, our regional banking portfolio, for example, continues to perform really and nice growth rates. And from that perspective, we see that continued what we call it a moderated improvement throughout the year to continue.\nDavid Togut : Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, what action steps do you need to take to win more transformation business from the bigger banks? Do you need to add more in the way of management consulting capability? What are the key pieces you're focused on?\nBrian Humphries : Yes, we've definitely been strengthening our consultancy business, but also, I would say more broadly than Cognizant Consulting, we've been trying to make sure that our client-facing teams holistically are more consultative. And that's a separate point, but nonetheless, similar in terms of the end product. And in parallel, I've personally been spending a lot of time on the road in the last 3 months in front of the C-suite of some of the larger banks, many of whom we haven't been able to serve in recent years and trying to make sure we have the opportunity to show up and be on their preferred vendor lists and evidencing to them the progress we've made with our portfolio and our strategic direction and how we think we can help them be successful in their own rights. So a little bit has been hunting. And then for those that we currently have, it's obviously been farming and making sure we have the right engagement teams, more advisory capacity, to your point, and then obviously educating clients who think of us differently as well. We're making progress. I think it's a paced recovery. It's ongoing, and we've continued to articulate that this business will likely grow slower than the company average rate, but yet we are confident we're doing the right things to get it in the right space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : Terrific. First one, I was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on what's going on in the M&A environment that's caused the slowdown in your pipeline there that you've seen sort of throughout this year, given the tightening macro environment and some -- the private markets tightening up a little bit. I would have thought it might get a little bit more fertile actually. So can you just give us a sense for sort of what you're seeing out there and why that has dried up a little bit?\nJan Siegmund : Yes, Lisa, I'll jump in. Thank you for that question because it's important for us to reiterate that really, our overall strategic framework of capital allocation is unchanged. We still believe M&A is an important tool that we have to enhance the competitiveness of our company to add and augment for us. So what we see here is really purely an operational and time delay basic -- a timing delay of M&A that happens when you develop pipelines and when you pursue deals to do so. It's also a little bit a consequence of a disciplined approach, which we're trying to signal in our prepared remarks. We are thoughtful about how we want to allocate that that capital in this uncertain environment, coming off very lofty valuation expectations, I think it is fairly typical that you have sellers having higher expectations than buyers are willing to do as we see the world through different lenses. And so we observed that a little bit as we also think about how do we justify the expense of M&A in a rational way. We are optimistic overall that we will continue with some M&A in the second half of the year. So we have an active pipeline, but there are always the vagaries of closing those transactions coming out to a mutual agreement. But the -- it would be really purely due to the, I think, the practical situation that we are faced with at this point in time of economy and buyer expectations, outlooks, et cetera.\nLisa Ellis : Got it. Okay. And then for my follow-up, I apologize for asking yet another question about this topic. But just a clarification on the supply fulfillment challenges that you mentioned have affected your revenue outlook for the year. You're just looking at your utilization numbers, they're pretty running fairly steady, I guess, not seeing that they're running really hot. So can you just clarify, like is this like a skills issue? Or just maybe give a little bit more elaboration on what causes that sort of supply-demand imbalance, given that the utilization numbers are still kind of running at more normal levels?\nJan Siegmund : Yes, Lisa, it is -- keep in mind that number one, for clarification, our revenue performance was really to a very small amount of our expectations. So we are now in the fine-tuning of the sausage-making a little bit around what happened in the quarter. And observation is correct that we have a consistent utilization performance over the last couple of quarters. But we have overlapping impact. For example, our utilization is negatively impacted by our increased intake of college grads. They tend to have warm up times till they become fully productive, and it weighs on our utilization metrics in a simplified way were where we have other tight skill sets that have led to high utilization and lost revenue opportunities. This is in particular the case in North America, where we had higher revenue carrying gaps in our capacity for delivery. And so this localized effect basically, is balancing out and created basically some missed revenue opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin : First one I got is on bookings. So I'm just trying to understand, are you experiencing pricing pushback and resourcing challenges that are causing more so delays or missed opportunities entirely? So I'm trying to get out really whether this is deal cycle extension or competitive loss and cancellation entirely there? And just how are you expecting fiscal '22 bookings growth to land now?\nBrian Humphries : Bryan, it's Brian. We'd expect an acceleration in the second half of the year. The book-to-bill ratio remains healthy, as I said, at 1.2, really on the back of Q3 and Q4 last year, where bookings growth of 20% plus in both quarters. Look, some of this is frankly us in a resource-constrained environment given our headcount opted out of certain lower-end or less strategic opportunities. And so that's business that we decided not to partake in because we chose to prioritize our resources for elements of our portfolio that are more strategic to our future direction. And clients that are more strategic from a customer segmentation point of view. So that's the first point. The second point I would say is we did see during the course of the quarter, I would say, pipeline progression be a little slower than prior quarters and some pushouts into outer quarter periods, higher levels than traditional. I don't think it's enough to signify by any means and concern from a macro demand point of view because bluntly, the biggest single factor we have is just making sure we get fulfillment, right, as opposed to worrying about the macro environment. We see plenty of opportunity for the clients I see. And frankly, I've probably visited a few hundred clients in the last quarter alone. So it's much more around our fulfillment capabilities and about the choice points we are faced with and that we take in a resource-constrained environment. As I said earlier, the average contract duration is a little bigger because we stepped away from some lower-end staff augmentation deals, and we've had a little bit more success in $50 million-plus category. So that's the dynamics I would articulate.\nBryan Bergin : Okay. And then just on margin. Maybe can you quantify or just talk about some of the larger underlying swing factors in the second half assumptions that you have? And I see in 2Q absolute dollar level of SG&A spend was roughly flat year-over-year despite the higher revenue base. So maybe can you talk about where exactly you're leveraging this? And to the tune of are you cutting more so around corporate? Or are you also throttling sales and marketing-related spend as well?\nJan Siegmund : Yes. I guess that comes to me. The margin performance in the first half has been driven by multi-factors, by a balanced set of contributors and I'm anticipating that to continue throughout the year. So pricing had a modest contribution, and we expect our pricing initiative to build on this and will increase in a slightly increase in importance for it. We had really seen good contributions from the strategic measures that Brian talked about, delivery permit optimization. All these factors have a higher intake of college grads, the careful use of subcontractors the shifting actually and could offset a large chunk of the compensation pressure that we're still facing and we anticipate to face throughout the year. So -- and I would say we had actually a slight growth, I think, by 3% SG&A growth in quarter-over-quarter. So there is -- we will be funding the growth that we need for our company, that is a priority. So SGA will now be in the way, our cost controls on SGA won't be limiting our investments into growth, but we are seeing also good progress in other corporate functions to drive efficiencies and simplify our operation, I think that you would expect us to do. So it's the multitude of these factors, and it's kind of a little bit of an art of how react to actual results in the -- within the quarter and emphasize one more than the other to drive the results. Maybe on the reminder is in -- the third quarter is traditionally our highest margin quarter. So we expect actually a sequential increase in margin in the third quarter. And then as you know, in the fourth quarter, our large compensation measure for the broad delivery organization takes place. So we expect some pressure in the fourth quarter and then deliver our guidance for the full year.\nBrian Humphries : I just want to touch upon the other question around the commercial team. Now we're absolutely committed to the commercial team. The multiyear guidance that we gave in our November Analyst Day, that became part of the 2022 revenue guidance is really about participating in growth markets, orienting the portfolio to our higher-growth categories and making sure we have world-class client-facing teams that are consultative in nature and that are productive in nature. And as many of you know, we've really built out a strong sales operations function here in recent years. We started showcasing to you the bookings position we have. We changed our variable compensation program for our commercial team and with a few years of data that we continue to hone in on opportunities around commercial productivity. But I would say the sales roster or the commercial roster is fundamentally similar to where it was in recent months and quarters, and we continue to want to invest in our commercial team and will invest in our commercial team in the years to come.\nBryan Bergin : Okay. I've just got one follow-up, apologies here. Just how much of the business mix is typically comprised of shorter-term deals or maybe project-based work that would have experienced the miss opportunities with the choices you made due to the supply tightness?\nJan Siegmund : I don't think we really give much detail on this. But as Brian mentioned on the bookings performance, where we saw the softness in bookings was disproportionate on what we call shorter-term deals, which makes exactly sense, as Brian had explained. So that portion was affected. But again, our variation from expectation is really a relatively small percentage numbers. So -- but we did see a little bit more pressure on the shorter-end deals compared to the longer-term deals.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Rayna Kumar with UBS.\nRayna Kumar : I just want to dig in a little more to your 3Q revenue guide. So it assumes a slowdown, right, in revenue growth from 2Q to 3Q. Are there any specific verticals or geography that you would call out that would cause that deceleration? And then second, your CMT revenue was very strong at 20% in the quarter. Any onetime items there? And how should we think of that growth going forward for the remainder of the year?\nJan Siegmund : Yes. I would not really narrow in on specific drivers by industry. Some of our industry groups have a little bit more difficult compares year-over-year. And you can kind of see that when you look at your -- our tables. But, overall, I think in the short term for the third quarter revenue guidance, is impacted by our year-to-date booking performance to some degree. And then our gradual improvement of our attrition rates kind of lead us to a certain revenue forecast that we have given you in our guidance.\nRayna Kumar : Understood. And just on the growth in CMT in the quarter, any call out on...\nJan Siegmund : I wanted to leave that to Brian, because it's a great story. And so Brian can take it.\nBrian Humphries : Yes. Look, it's -- as you'll see in the SEC filings, the Communications, Media and Technology business for us is actually our most profitable industry segment externally. We have tremendous momentum there, a strong team who've been driving good momentum with digital native companies, fully leveraging our intuitive operations and automation business group as well. But we have strong client relationships. We've been executing well. Delivery excellence is very strong. I know a lot of these clients personally, they speak to our differentiated offerings and differentiated delivery. So this has been a business we've been investing in for many years as we've made the portfolio a little bit more diverse beyond healthcare and FSI. Products and Resources and CMT have been growing double digits for many, many years. And CMT is one of the showcases, I think, of our success in that regard, both in the United States as well as internationally. So nothing fundamentally that concerns me in terms of underlying currents there. We just have good momentum and a strong team.\nBrian Humphries: All right. With that, thank you, everybody, for joining our call. Look forward to catching up next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to comment on several topics today, notably our second quarter performance, the demand and pricing environment and labor market dynamics. Let's start with our second quarter performance, which was balanced. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 9.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by digital. Second quarter operating margin was 15.5%, up 50 basis points sequentially, in line with our expectations. Financial leverage driven by sequential revenue growth, disciplined expense management, currency benefits and the optimization of pyramid, shoring and fulfillment helped offset the impact of attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. Our industry segment performance remained largely consistent. Financial Services grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency, led by insurance growth. This includes a negative impact of 190 basis points from the exit of Samlink. We continue to make progress strengthening client relationships in Financial Services. Earlier in the second quarter, I visited clients in Germany and celebrated a new logo win with Zurich Insurance Germany. Cognizant will help them simplify, modernize and manage their enterprise application landscape by establishing joint DevOps teams and working to extend the insurers' AI, data, software engineering and cloud capabilities. In insurance, CCC Intelligent Solutions whose SaaS platform powers the property and casualty insurance industry, asked for our help in enabling their cloud transformation program. We led with our enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation consultancy and partnered with Microsoft to present a comprehensive solution. This prompted the client to also select us to build next-generation analytics and telematics solutions that are expected to be key to their long-term leadership. In the second quarter, we combined our Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments into a single operating segment called Health Sciences and naturally dilution, given the market conversions across these industries. Health Sciences grew 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency, with growth driven by pharmaceutical clients and sustained momentum in our TriZetto product portfolio. Commonwealth Care Alliance, an integrated care system serving over 60,000 members across numerous U.S. states, illustrates our momentum in TriZetto. Our end-to-end business process innovation powered by TriZetto solutions and a BPaaS engagement is fully integrated from enrollment and billing through claims. Through our partnership, Commonwealth Care now has the tools needed to compete in the digital health ecosystem and support value-based personalized care for its members. We've also signed a new multiyear agreement with Organon, a global women's health company to help improve the delivery of healthcare products and crucial medicinal supply chain management. We'll help Organon scale its healthcare business by delivering full stack industrial technology support for its global pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Indonesia. We continue to see excellent growth in Products and Resources, where revenue grew 11.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven in part by strength among automotive, logistics, retail and consumer goods clients. As a strategic partner for digital, we're helping Albertsons Companies, a $70 billion grocery retailer, make their move to a cloud-based infrastructure model, enabling innovation and improved customer experiences, both in-store and across last-mile delivery. In Communications, Media and Technology, we had another quarter of excellent growth. Revenue grew 19.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven by technology clients and new client acquisition. DocuSign is an example of a new logo win. They selected Cognizant as the preferred partner for global customer support operations across all products and services from their flagship e-signature product to newer contract life cycle management products. DocuSign turned to us because of the distinctive solution proposed by our intuitive operations and automation practice, including cutting-edge omnichannel customer support and outcome-based commercial models. A quick word on our recently announced organizational evolution. In July, we announced the combination of our practice areas with delivery practices, which simplifies our model by bringing Cognizant in line with industry norms. This enables us to have end-to-end accountability across 4 integrated practices from vision, road map offerings and capabilities, including M&A and post-merger integration through to presale solutioning and delivery. I believe this will assist our industry teams to be more successful with our clients as we sell solution and deliver client outcomes. I also believe that our industry capabilities provide differentiation that we can unlock value for clients at the intersection of industry use cases and technology. Moving now to the demand and pricing environment. While we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of a worsening economy in our pipeline, to date, we've not seen any significant slowdown for IT services demand. That said, as we serve some of the largest clients in the world, we are aware that should they see slowing earnings growth, nonessential projects or those with longer ROI may be paused. I am confident that the breadth of our portfolio enables us to serve our clients' needs for higher levels of agility, innovation, resilience and indeed, efficiency. So regardless of what the coming quarters bring, our value proposition to clients remains. More generally, digital transformation has become so essential and foundational to most companies, regardless of their industry, that despite some macro demand uncertainty in the short term, I remain optimistic on IT services' growth prospects in the medium to long term. In fact, the bigger challenges we are faced with as an industry are the demand supply and balance on key digital skills, elevated attrition and labor cost inflationary pressure. I would like to thank our associates around the world who've been working hard to navigate these challenges, all whilst trying to optimize fulfillment and pricing. Achieving the perfect balance is not always easy. And in the second quarter, while I'm pleased that we drove both year-over-year and sequential margin expansion, I suspect that our focus on fulfillment optimization and pricing marginally impacted top line performance and hurt bookings momentum. Second quarter bookings declined 3% year-over-year, below our assumptions entering the quarter. While we continue to have a robust book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, by better balancing the factors just mentioned, we aim to accelerate bookings growth in other quarters, whilst nonetheless achieving our committed margin expansion. Just a word now on pricing. Market pricing dynamics remain consistent. Clients, through their vendor exposure and their internal teams, are privy to demand supply and balances across key digital skills and labor cost inflationary pressure. This, coupled with the pent-up demand for digital transformation, means clients are more predisposed to engage in price increase discussions. Clients are willing to pay for skills and innovation, with efficiencies, including automation and optimized delivery mix, are expected to mitigate cost increases. We continue to execute against a pricing initiative to offset labor cost inflationary pressure, with benefits starting to be felt, but greater impact expected in the coming quarters, recognizing that pricing power stemming from talent shortages will lag behind talent-related cost increases. Let's move now to labor market dynamics, including attrition and inflationary pressure. Second quarter voluntary attrition rose 5 points to 31% on an annualized basis or 32% on a trailing 12-month basis. This increase was slightly above the seasonal uptick we anticipated entering the quarter, impacting second quarter revenue performance. While we have seen some signs of improvement in July resignation rates, we continue to expect elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. As I've mentioned on prior calls, attracting, retaining and rallying our talented employees is one of our top priorities. In the past year, we've invested record levels in compensation, overhauled our promotion process, invested heavily in our learning and development initiatives and introduced a series of other measures, including educational programs and returnships. Our internal job moves program, which facilitates ongoing upward mobility in the company, is one factor that enables us to mitigate the need for and deep the cost pressure of lateral hires, all whilst improving morale. We've also recognized how important flexibility is to our associates and have, therefore, communicated a hybrid model will define our approach to work. Our priority is to be a welcoming inclusive, equitable company for everyone in no matter their work location. Our clients and associate-centric company aims to strike a balance between how clients want to interact with us and the flexibility we seek, all while maintaining a focus on employee engagement, collaboration, our values and a culture of continuous learning. I'm pleased to see that our efforts on employee engagement are working. In recent weeks, we completed our annual engagement survey that showed significant increases in our engagement scores, positioning us above industry benchmarks. In closing, as we execute our strategy, we were operating with 3 clear priorities: first, execute our vision to become the preeminent technology services partner to the Global 2000 C-suite; second, rally and engage our associates around the world; and third, drive profitable growth. Despite some near-term macro demand uncertainty and the challenges of navigating today's labor markets, let's not forget that we are in -- at the early stages of what we expect to be a massive digital build-out. Thanks to our portfolio and our talented employees around the world, we believe that we will be a strategic beneficiary as companies embrace digital operating models. Finally, as we reposition Cognizant towards selling, solutioning and delivering industry-aligned solutions, enabled by targeted advisory capabilities, our margin potential will be strengthened in line with our brand repositioning to higher-value services. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Rod, it's Brian here. Thanks for the question. Look, it's very much related to more towards the demand supply and balance that we see in the market. We gave guidance in November around the revenue target range of 8 to 11 over the coming years with about 2 points from M&A. Today, we reported 9.5 points of growth, so within that range. And even the guidance we gave is within that range. But my hope obviously, is that with better demand supply situation Cognizant would have better headcount and be better able to get after the revenue opportunity, whilst also I feel pretty good about where we are on margin these days. So really for us now is about getting -- continuing to evolve the business portfolio, if you will, to higher growth categories, making sure we get the headcount right, both in terms of increasing retention and making sure we even get better throughput in terms of our recruitment. And then, of course, targeted M&A, which tends to be accretive to our revenue CAGR, some targeted larger deals that may or may not come ultimately, in years to come. But we'll be selective on those, as I've always said. And in some regards, today's margin profile, I think, is also indicative of the fact that in recent years, we haven't made big bets that may have been wrong in terms of attrition assumptions or margin or cost assumptions. So it's really about those things, Rod. Macro, we've seen some impact in terms of pipeline progression but it's been more modest. We haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of slowdown in demand, and I'm still certainly of the opinion that's while we'll have to keep an eye on the earnings cycle of our major clients and understand how they think about larger projects or ERP rollouts or projects with ROI time lines. At the end of the day, I'm very optimistic about IT services growth prospects in the medium to long term, and we'll continue to shape the portfolio to make sure we were able to show up and add value to clients. Jason, it's Brian. So you said it right, bookings can be choppy, which is why I've always been an advocate of looking at bookings on a rolling 12-month basis. So on a trailing 12-month basis, our bookings are still quite strong with a book-to-bill of 1.2. But within any given quarter, you'll have dynamics at play. And this was a quarter where we knew we had to go focus on resource fulfillment, given where we were from an attrition and resource point of view, but also we wanted to make sure, given labor inflationary trends, we were able to address pricing discussions with clients. And that may have had even a psychological impact on our commercial team as they are focused on fulfillment and focus on pricing discussions, and perhaps concerned about selling the next thing if they're worried about being able to fulfill against it. So it's not quite as clean as you suggested. But fundamentally, we'd expect this to pick up in Q3 and Q4. Demand is there to the question that Rod asked earlier. We feel pretty good about our portfolio these days. We are repositioning the brand and repositioning how Cognizant shows up to clients and the kind of work we want to engage in. So it's maybe a question of balance. That's perhaps the word of this quarter's earnings. We're very proud that we're an outlier in the industry in the sense that we were able to drive margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We obviously want to accompany that with revenue growth and bookings momentum, and that's what we're setting out to achieve, obviously, on a go-forward basis. We've taken significant actions from an attrition point of view, both in terms of compensation, significant investments in career path and overall our promotion process, significant investments in learning and development, and then in a whole host of other activities around education, returnships and whatnot. I will say there are some opportunities here that we have. This is seasonally in line with, I guess, expectations, although it was a little above what we had assumed going into the quarter. But we are somewhat confident that the actions we're taking are really kicking in. Employee engagement, as I suggested in my prepared remarks showed increases year-over-year across all 8 categories that we measured and were above industry benchmarks by the way. We have seen progress in terms of the actions we've been taking in the last 18 months. It has really improved our relative compensation position across key markets, including India. And while it's only 1 month of the quarter, the resignation trends we've seen in July, which isn't just about Q3, it's also about Q4, have been improving. And we have good success on this internal job moves program, which is creating a much more dynamic promotion process. So those are good leading indicators, I'd say, in terms of retention. On the recruitment side, I think it's fair to say the industry has been faced with almost its musical chair situation, where people show up with multiple job offers. The macro dynamics may actually start becoming more favorable. Early indications are that offer to join, our ratios have recovered a little bit in recent weeks, and I dare say, for us, perhaps for others as well. So we're looking forward to hopefully being able to build our headcount more aggressively on a go-forward basis and therefore, be able to achieve our true top line potential on the back of increased operational rigor and margin discipline that we've The other thing I'd just add to that as well is, of course, all headcount is not the same. We've seen a shift of our delivery to offshore in the last few years. And I think where we have to put a little bit more effort in place is to continue to build our onshore headcount, particularly in North America. We've gone through a pretty extensive effort in the last 3 years to reduce visa dependency in North America. But hand in glove with that, we have to continue to scale campus hiring, lateral hires, -- and obviously, headcounts in North America, well, maybe having a lower margin rate can actually give us more dollars per head on both revenue and indeed gross margin. So that's an important factor as well. But yes, we're all over this, and you can imagine it's got our full attention, both in terms of the recruitment throughput, offer-joiner ratios that we track as well as what we're doing from a retention point of view. Obviously, the employee satisfaction and employee engagement survey results were very pleasing to see. So it's good to see the progress we're making. We don't really get into those details, but our average contract duration actually increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Some of that is because we had a little bit more momentum in larger deals, and some of it is because of the situation that in a resource-constrained environment, we were quite selective in terms of the deals that we get after with a view to ultimately aligning our resources in line with our business model evolution. And that business model evolution is around aligning resources to our targeted customer segments, aligned to selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes as opposed to simply being a provider of resources for clients. And if you're simply a provider of resources for clients, you can skew to lower-end deals and being in the mode of staff augmentation. So our strategy informs our actions. And this quarter, obviously, with the cards we had, which was a resource-constrained environment, we obviously had the luxury of being able to make choice points that were both beneficial to our strategic direction as well as beneficial to our margins. Yes, I'll start. Jan, by all means, jump in if you want to embellish this as well. I think at the end of the day, James, we go back to the multiyear framework we laid out in November, not that long ago at the Analyst Day, when we talked about a revenue CAGR aspiration coupled with margin expansion over multiple years. And I would argue that's still the right way to think about Cognizant. Nothing has fundamentally changed. The results we announced this quarter, 9.5% constant currency growth with significant margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, unlike the rest of the industry, I think fits within that mode and so too does our guidance. Clearly, the more resources we have, the more we'll be able to go on the attack more from a top line perspective. But what we've been really focused on is making sure we put a good operational discipline in place in terms of how we think about pricing, how we think about mix, delivery pyramid, et cetera, that's been a multiyear effort. We've also made investments, by the way, in the company that are starting to the bear fruit now. And of course, we get financial leverage the more we grow sequentially. So it's no -- not really fundamentally different from what we outlined back in November, and that's how you should think about us going forward as well. As we are better able to make progress on our retention trends, we'll have the luxury to be able to hopefully accelerate growth and get the balance a little bit better than this quarter. Yes. David, it's Brian. Look, I would say no major concerns in terms of demand curves in the financial services sector generally and within banking. We certainly had a good quarter, I would say, in commercial banking, which was stronger than retail and cards and payments and indeed, stronger than capital markets. So what we see there is, frankly, some more of a selective approach from Cognizant as we have repositioned ourselves with some of the larger banks, a shift away from staff augmentation with their transformation programs and really their innovation agenda. So it's been an evolution of how we -- the teams we have in front of clients and what they are about to sell and hopefully solution and deliver, but also educating clients to think about Cognizant differently. But I don't see any fundamental issues in terms of macro concerns in the banking space. Insurance, we seem to have done well in the quarter as well. Generally, most of the vast majority is in the United States. And we had a, I would say, a reasonably strong quarter there, too. And no major concerns either from a macro perspective there. Yes, we've definitely been strengthening our consultancy business, but also, I would say more broadly than Cognizant Consulting, we've been trying to make sure that our client-facing teams holistically are more consultative. And that's a separate point, but nonetheless, similar in terms of the end product. And in parallel, I've personally been spending a lot of time on the road in the last 3 months in front of the C-suite of some of the larger banks, many of whom we haven't been able to serve in recent years and trying to make sure we have the opportunity to show up and be on their preferred vendor lists and evidencing to them the progress we've made with our portfolio and our strategic direction and how we think we can help them be successful in their own rights. So a little bit has been hunting. And then for those that we currently have, it's obviously been farming and making sure we have the right engagement teams, more advisory capacity, to your point, and then obviously educating clients who think of us differently as well. We're making progress. I think it's a paced recovery. It's ongoing, and we've continued to articulate that this business will likely grow slower than the company average rate, but yet we are confident we're doing the right things to get it in the right space. Bryan, it's Brian. We'd expect an acceleration in the second half of the year. The book-to-bill ratio remains healthy, as I said, at 1.2, really on the back of Q3 and Q4 last year, where bookings growth of 20% plus in both quarters. Look, some of this is frankly us in a resource-constrained environment given our headcount opted out of certain lower-end or less strategic opportunities. And so that's business that we decided not to partake in because we chose to prioritize our resources for elements of our portfolio that are more strategic to our future direction. And clients that are more strategic from a customer segmentation point of view. So that's the first point. The second point I would say is we did see during the course of the quarter, I would say, pipeline progression be a little slower than prior quarters and some pushouts into outer quarter periods, higher levels than traditional. I don't think it's enough to signify by any means and concern from a macro demand point of view because bluntly, the biggest single factor we have is just making sure we get fulfillment, right, as opposed to worrying about the macro environment. We see plenty of opportunity for the clients I see. And frankly, I've probably visited a few hundred clients in the last quarter alone. So it's much more around our fulfillment capabilities and about the choice points we are faced with and that we take in a resource-constrained environment. As I said earlier, the average contract duration is a little bigger because we stepped away from some lower-end staff augmentation deals, and we've had a little bit more success in $50 million-plus category. So that's the dynamics I would articulate. I just want to touch upon the other question around the commercial team. Now we're absolutely committed to the commercial team. The multiyear guidance that we gave in our November Analyst Day, that became part of the 2022 revenue guidance is really about participating in growth markets, orienting the portfolio to our higher-growth categories and making sure we have world-class client-facing teams that are consultative in nature and that are productive in nature. And as many of you know, we've really built out a strong sales operations function here in recent years. We started showcasing to you the bookings position we have. We changed our variable compensation program for our commercial team and with a few years of data that we continue to hone in on opportunities around commercial productivity. But I would say the sales roster or the commercial roster is fundamentally similar to where it was in recent months and quarters, and we continue to want to invest in our commercial team and will invest in our commercial team in the years to come. Yes. Look, it's -- as you'll see in the SEC filings, the Communications, Media and Technology business for us is actually our most profitable industry segment externally. We have tremendous momentum there, a strong team who've been driving good momentum with digital native companies, fully leveraging our intuitive operations and automation business group as well. But we have strong client relationships. We've been executing well. Delivery excellence is very strong. I know a lot of these clients personally, they speak to our differentiated offerings and differentiated delivery. So this has been a business we've been investing in for many years as we've made the portfolio a little bit more diverse beyond healthcare and FSI. Products and Resources and CMT have been growing double digits for many, many years. And CMT is one of the showcases, I think, of our success in that regard, both in the United States as well as internationally. So nothing fundamentally that concerns me in terms of underlying currents there. We just have good momentum and a strong team. All right. With that, thank you, everybody, for joining our call. Look forward to catching up next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While our Q2 revenue growth was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range, we delivered sequential margin expansion in line with our expectations, while continuing to invest into our talented people. We remain focused on profitable revenue growth. Moving on to results. Q2 revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year or 9.5% at constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions and a negative 60 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q2, digital revenue, as reported, grew 13% year-over-year and included FX headwinds of approximately 250 basis points, consistent with the total company. At quarter end, digital represented approximately 50% of total revenue, up 3 points from the prior year period. In addition to the FX headwinds, slowing of digital growth reflected lower inorganic contribution and elevated attrition, in particular, in North America. Despite these headwinds, we were pleased with the growth across our digital battlegrounds, which outpaced the total digital growth. As Brian mentioned, Q2 bookings declined 3% year-over-year. This resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.2 billion, which represented a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2, unchanged from Q1. Despite the softer-than-expected growth, we continue to believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our revenue growth outlook for 2022. We expect to improve bookings growth in the quarters ahead. Moving on to segment results for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 5%. Q2 growth included a negative 190 basis points impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. Our recovery within financial services remains largely in line with our expectation, driven by continued strength in our North America regional banking portfolio, growth in the UK and steady performance within insurance globally. Health Sciences revenue increased approximately 8%, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies. Demand among healthcare clients was consistent with last quarter. Momentum continued in our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue increased approximately 12%, driven by growth across all segments and included approximately 260 basis points contribution from recently completed acquisitions. This compares to the approximately 500 basis points contribution we reported in Q1 of this year. Based on the current portfolio of closed acquisitions, we expect the inorganic contribution to be immaterial to segment performance beginning in Q3. Communications, Media & Technology or CMT revenue grew approximately 20%, primarily organically, including growth from new clients. This reflects growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients. We also continue to experience strong demand for our intuitive operations and automation services, which includes our BPO business. From a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth was led by CMT and Life Sciences clients. Our global growth markets, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 12% year-over-year in constant currency, which included a negative 240 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. Growth was led again by the UK, which grew 25% and included strong double-digit growth within financial services, including public sector science, Products and Resources and CMT. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth in our GGM business and do not believe that we are hitting our full potential yet. Now moving on to margins. In Q2, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15.5%, as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin increased by approximately 30 basis points, in line with our expectations. This included improvement in gross margin, driven in part by a balanced execution and our focus on profitable revenue growth. We also experienced a benefit from the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and a modest benefit from our recent pricing initiatives. Additionally, we were pleased with the SG&A leverage we drove in the quarter. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 24.2%, and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.2%, which benefited from a discrete tax benefit related to our unrepatriated accumulated foreign earnings, driven by the depreciation of the rupee. Q2 Diluted GAAP EPS was $1.11, and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 14% and 18% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion or net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q2 was $485 million, representing approximately 84% of net income, in line with our expectation. This brings year-to-date free cash flow to $671 million. DSO of 74 days increased by 2 days sequentially, driven in part by seasonality and by 3 days year-over-year. We expect to improve DSO in the second half of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $141 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. This brings total capital return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends to over $1 billion through the first half of 2022. Turning to guidance. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes that we will continue to balance margin performance and revenue growth. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $4.98 billion to $5.03 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5% to 6% or 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 50 basis points, which reflects the lower-than-anticipated M&A activity compared with our assumptions in prior full year guidance. For the full year, we are lowering the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth guidance by about 1 point, which reflects, in part, the impact we have had while navigating the current industry supply-demand imbalances, elevated attrition and softer-than-expected hiring, particularly in North America. However, we are maintaining our margin expansion guidance, which reflects prioritization of profitable growth, pricing initiatives and the rigor that we have put around SG&A. Our full year revenue, we still expect inorganic growth to contribute approximately 100 basis points to growth, unchanged from prior guidance. This assumes an immaterial contribution from future unannounced acquisitions in Q4. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 220 basis points impact from currency versus 180 basis points previously. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance in the range of $19.7 billion to $19.9 billion, representing 6.3% to 7.3% growth or 8.5% to 9.5% growth in constant currency. This compares to our prior guidance of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion, which represented growth of 7.2% to 9.2% or 9% to 11% in constant currency. Our longer-term capital allocation framework is unchanged. Today's uncertain macroeconomic backdrop has the potential to create a mismatch of valuation expectations between buyers and sellers as well as challenging synergy assumptions. Despite these dynamics, our pipeline remains active, and we expect to announce deals towards the end of this year. However, these factors have led us to deploy less capital than anticipated on M&A. Therefore, we are revising our capital allocation plans for the remainder of 2022. We now expect to return at least $1.2 billion through share repurchases for the full year, up from our commitment of at least $600 million last quarter. As always, this remains subject to market conditions and other factors. Given the strength of our balance sheet and expected free cash flow generation, we do not expect liquidity will restrict our ability to execute against our M&A pipeline for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged, and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints, the elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margins include increased compensation costs, C&E and a return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. Our guidance assumes continued sequential margin expansion in Q3 before the impact of our annual merit cycle in Q4. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of approximately $35 million versus $25 million previously, reflecting higher interest rates. Based on our increased share repurchase activity, we now expect average shares outstanding of approximately 519 million versus 522 million shares previously. We also now expect a tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% to 26%, reflecting lower year-to-date performance. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.51 to $4.57, up approximately 9% to 11% year-over-year. This compares to $4.45 to $4.55 previously. Finally, we are still targeting full year free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. Rod, I'll jump in. The pricing environment, we would still overall characterize as consistent, and we feel we do have pricing opportunities for us that we are realizing and working hard to achieve. We see better opportunities in our digital opportunities where the demand is really difficult to supply and value is high, our new digital type services as we see better opportunities we talked in last quarter about our initiatives to drive pricing across our entire client portfolio. And we're making progress. We always anticipated that this would be a multi-quarter endeavor. Some of these negotiations are ongoing, but we do see early results, and that's why I mentioned in my commentary that we do see some modest contribution from pricing, not only to margin, but obviously, to our overall margin development. Yes. Maybe just as a quick reminder, our second quarter is typically a higher attrition quarter that has to do with some of the bonus payments that we issue in the end of March. So we knew that we would have increased attrition that we don't expect to continue throughout the year. So that's number one. It does -- it did turn out to be a little bit higher, maybe also for the revenue impact that we identified, it had -- it did tick up a little bit higher and a little bit more impact in North America than the core of our operation in India. So from a medium-term perspective, I would think we still have elevated attrition levels, although not at the level that we have seen in the second quarter. Yes. And maybe I'll add the component of the business mix that we have been adding in our growth. We have gotten these questions in past calls. We have been absent from large and mega deals in the past and in the last couple of years. And arguably, that had slow our revenue growth, but it allowed us to much better control our balanced portfolio of the revenue growth within the corridors that we outlined, plus the margin expansion, which is just our fundamental belief will build the compounding, the most quality type business over time. Yes. Look, I think we are really to -- year-to-date quite close to the path that we had anticipated for the year. So I would point out the trajectory that we definitely look forward to improve is our bookings growth. And obviously, on a relative basis, also our employee attrition because that combination will allow us to drive a revenue growth acceleration basically, within the framework that we have outlined and deliver against our bottom line commitments. So the -- I think those would be the two factors that we'll be working hard. I tried to outline the opportunity that we see is not enterprise-wide unfocused. We can with, focused actions, drive improvements. For example, in my script, I mentioned the North American situation, I think we're going to pay extra attention to drive our North American staffing that will have good revenue impact and will strengthen us. That would be good action. We'll be very careful, encouraging our overall, a lot for revenue growth and bookings throughout our distribution and sales capabilities. And then the rest feels to me is in relatively good shape. We have our SG&A now as we have committed to in a good and controlled environment and we are able to drive that margin balance through this combination. And it is a number of factors that come too, by shifting towards our digital mix, which is accretive to our overall gross margin by making continued progress on our pricing action that will help to drive top line growth and the sustainability of our margin profile. So it's kind of a balance of -- we have kind of the foundations and innovative from my perspective in good shape so that we're now addressing selective areas of improvement for the rest of the year. Maybe I'll just add some obvious things. Keep in mind that the reported results still reflect the impact of our disposition of Samlink, that is about 200 basis points impact on the growth rate. In substantiation of Brian's comments, we do see, for example, digital revenue and revenue shares catching up to our company average and making progress on that mix. Brian gave you the cut by our sectors, we have also regional success, our regional banking portfolio, for example, continues to perform really and nice growth rates. And from that perspective, we see that continued what we call it a moderated improvement throughout the year to continue. Yes, Lisa, I'll jump in. Thank you for that question because it's important for us to reiterate that really, our overall strategic framework of capital allocation is unchanged. We still believe M&A is an important tool that we have to enhance the competitiveness of our company to add and augment for us. So what we see here is really purely an operational and time delay basic -- a timing delay of M&A that happens when you develop pipelines and when you pursue deals to do so. It's also a little bit a consequence of a disciplined approach, which we're trying to signal in our prepared remarks. We are thoughtful about how we want to allocate that that capital in this uncertain environment, coming off very lofty valuation expectations, I think it is fairly typical that you have sellers having higher expectations than buyers are willing to do as we see the world through different lenses. And so we observed that a little bit as we also think about how do we justify the expense of M&A in a rational way. We are optimistic overall that we will continue with some M&A in the second half of the year. So we have an active pipeline, but there are always the vagaries of closing those transactions coming out to a mutual agreement. But the -- it would be really purely due to the, I think, the practical situation that we are faced with at this point in time of economy and buyer expectations, outlooks, et cetera. Yes, Lisa, it is -- keep in mind that number one, for clarification, our revenue performance was really to a very small amount of our expectations. So we are now in the fine-tuning of the sausage-making a little bit around what happened in the quarter. And observation is correct that we have a consistent utilization performance over the last couple of quarters. But we have overlapping impact. For example, our utilization is negatively impacted by our increased intake of college grads. They tend to have warm up times till they become fully productive, and it weighs on our utilization metrics in a simplified way were where we have other tight skill sets that have led to high utilization and lost revenue opportunities. This is in particular the case in North America, where we had higher revenue carrying gaps in our capacity for delivery. And so this localized effect basically, is balancing out and created basically some missed revenue opportunities. Yes. I guess that comes to me. The margin performance in the first half has been driven by multi-factors, by a balanced set of contributors and I'm anticipating that to continue throughout the year. So pricing had a modest contribution, and we expect our pricing initiative to build on this and will increase in a slightly increase in importance for it. We had really seen good contributions from the strategic measures that Brian talked about, delivery permit optimization. All these factors have a higher intake of college grads, the careful use of subcontractors the shifting actually and could offset a large chunk of the compensation pressure that we're still facing and we anticipate to face throughout the year. So -- and I would say we had actually a slight growth, I think, by 3% SG&A growth in quarter-over-quarter. So there is -- we will be funding the growth that we need for our company, that is a priority. So SGA will now be in the way, our cost controls on SGA won't be limiting our investments into growth, but we are seeing also good progress in other corporate functions to drive efficiencies and simplify our operation, I think that you would expect us to do. So it's the multitude of these factors, and it's kind of a little bit of an art of how react to actual results in the -- within the quarter and emphasize one more than the other to drive the results. Maybe on the reminder is in -- the third quarter is traditionally our highest margin quarter. So we expect actually a sequential increase in margin in the third quarter. And then as you know, in the fourth quarter, our large compensation measure for the broad delivery organization takes place. So we expect some pressure in the fourth quarter and then deliver our guidance for the full year. I don't think we really give much detail on this. But as Brian mentioned on the bookings performance, where we saw the softness in bookings was disproportionate on what we call shorter-term deals, which makes exactly sense, as Brian had explained. So that portion was affected. But again, our variation from expectation is really a relatively small percentage numbers. So -- but we did see a little bit more pressure on the shorter-end deals compared to the longer-term deals. Yes. I would not really narrow in on specific drivers by industry. Some of our industry groups have a little bit more difficult compares year-over-year. And you can kind of see that when you look at your -- our tables. But, overall, I think in the short term for the third quarter revenue guidance, is impacted by our year-to-date booking performance to some degree. And then our gradual improvement of our attrition rates kind of lead us to a certain revenue forecast that we have given you in our guidance. I wanted to leave that to Brian, because it's a great story. And so Brian can take it."

Thanks to our talented employees, we delivered on our first quarter commitments in what continues to be an intensely competitive global labor market. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year in constant currency, above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance of 10.2% to 11.2% growth. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year and now represents 50% of our revenue. We had another exceptional quarter in digital business operations, which continues to meaningfully outgrow the BPO market reflecting momentum in intelligent process automation and digital native clients. First quarter operating margin was 15%, down slightly sequentially as expected, reflecting seasonality. First quarter bookings growth of 4% was in line with our expectations following exceptional bookings growth in the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have a robust book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.2x revenue reflecting bookings of over $23 billion. Given a healthy pipeline, we anticipate bookings growth acceleration in the second quarter and for the full year. Over the last 3 months, I've met employees, partners and clients across 4 continents. While the global economic environment is uncertain, based on these interactions, I remain optimistic about IT services industry demand for the foreseeable future. Clients are making the shift to digital operating models to become more agile, automated and innovative. They know that it is the only way to deliver customer-centric user experience and hyper personalization, to simplify complex workflows and to build a modern operating infrastructure that's Our strategic repositioning enables us to engage more deeply with clients, helping them to succeed and supports our growth trajectory. Our capabilities are in strong demand as digital becomes mainstream. Ultimately, I believe that our scale in India, complemented by our growing global delivery network, will differentiate us as clients seek talent and business stability. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to be attrition, demand supply imbalances and inflationary pressure. I'd like to thank our teams across the globe for their leadership, patience and engagement as we navigate these challenges and execute against our client commitments. Today, more than ever, employees demand that we invest not just in total rewards, including compensation, but also in the end-to-end employee experience, their skilling and career advancement. Cognizant has always been known for our investment in our people. And in the last year, we built in this legacy with accelerated skilling and enhancements to our promotion framework. First quarter voluntary attrition fell 5 points to 26% on an annualized basis or 29% on a trailing 12-month basis. While we made sequential progress reducing voluntary attrition for the second consecutive quarter, we anticipate attrition will remain elevated for the full year and will increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality. To mitigate labor cost increases and the investments we are making in our people, we continue to execute against a series of measures including our automation agenda, pyramid and shoring optimization and a deep pricing. Turning to the industry segments. In Financial Services, our ongoing recovery continue with growth of 6% year-over-year in constant currency reflecting the sale of our Samlink subsidiary in February, continue to make progress repositioning the business towards higher growth and higher value services and solutions with a more focused client set. We expect to pace recovery in banking and insurance to continue with strong demand for digital transformation. One client whose digital transformation journey we've been supporting is ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. We are transforming the bank's IT landscape into a hybrid cloud platform with a focus on security and regulatory compliance. We'll be implementing an end-to-end secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service model in support of the bank's IT modernization agenda. In health care, revenue grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, with particularly strong growth in Life Sciences. Our investments to modernize the TriZetto product portfolio, which includes the integration of AI and machine learning capabilities continued to pay off. Our clients are responding to our commitment to deliver next-generation platform solutions that help them offer patients real-time insights and personalized care. We're keeping our products cutting edge, building new solutions across the value chain and capitalizing on the opportunity at the intersection of health and digital in areas such as virtual care and telehealth. During the first quarter, we announced our collaboration with Microsoft to deliver a new digital health solution designed to improve medical care. Leveraging Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, our new solution is the first of several planned offerings that combine remote patient monitoring and virtual health using products like smart watches, blood pressure monitors and glucose meters to collect and communicate patient health data to providers. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a leading health insurer with more than 2 million members is a great example of how we're partnering with AWS to drive digital transformation. Wellmark aims to improve the experience of their stakeholders by accelerating cloud migration and data modernization, all while strengthening their information security. In Products and Resources, we continue to see excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Automation is top of mind for clients like Pacific Gas and Electric, which sought our help to realize their vision for a new digital productivity center of excellence that aims to reduce manual efforts, simplify their automation tools and provide agile and scalable solutions for their business and IT users. To that end, our IPA team helped deploy Microsoft Power platform and simplified our tool sets with Cognizant Neuro, our recently announced intelligent automation fabric. PG&E is now well on its way to saving 1 million hours of work through low code, no code automation. Finally, in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, where we've sustained double-digit growth over the last 4 quarters. I'd like to briefly switch gears now to the future of work, a universal topic amongst the C-Suite with enduring societal implications. Organizations around the world are deliberating how to best attract, engage and retain employees. The events of the past few years have prompted people worldwide to question their life and work choices, including how and where they work. In the meantime, executive teams are determining how to best nurture company culture and values in the face of today's labor market realities and a hybrid work environment. These socioeconomic questions also intersect with business practicalities such as real estate strategy, one of the many things we are currently reviewing. One of the prominent business themes of our time is the relationship between purpose and work. Purpose encompasses all the values that drive people's choices, actions and attitudes from wider social and environmental goals to professional and personal objectives such as a healthy work-life balance. That's 1 reason we put so much time, thought and energy into developing and activating a compelling purpose, vision and set of values for our company, which express our commitment to making a positive impact on the environment and the wider society. We continue to advance our ESG agenda, applying our knowledge, portfolio and partnerships to engineer new levels of environmental and social benefits for our company, clients and communities. In April, we announced that we will source 100% renewable energy for all our global offices and facilities by the end of 2026. Sourcing 100% renewable energy supports our goal, and as last year, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and responds to client expectations that business transition to a low-carbon economy. We also want our employees, clients, partners and other stakeholders to better understand today's Cognizant, which is why during the first quarter, we modernized and reintroduced our brand to mirror the company we've become, the services leader with world-class digital solutions and talent. Our brand now carries the tagline, Intuition Engineered. This is our promise to engineer clients' businesses so they can anticipate and meet their customers' needs with the insight and speed of intuition. As a global company, we will always stand with the right of people to choose a path of self-determination and democracy. Wave humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine, Cognizant contributed $1 million in grants to several organizations that are delivering food, water, shelter, health care and economic assistance. We joined the international community in hoping that a path to lasting peace can be found soon. In closing, I believe we\u2019re strategically well positioned to capture a large growing addressable market and drive profitable revenue growth. A month ago, I marked my third year anniversary leading Cognizant. While we are a company in transition, our evolution has been significant across multiple dimensions. We're putting the company on a strong growth trajectory, and I'm optimistic about Cognizant's prospects as we bolster our portfolio judiciously, to not only build and run clients' technology foundations but also transform their enterprises into modern businesses. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum within our digital portfolio. While overall uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, we continue to see a healthy demand environment across our portfolio of services and offerings. Q1 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 9.7% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 220 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions partially offset by a negative 40 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q1, Digital revenue grew 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 50% of total revenue. During the quarter, we reviewed the scope of our digital ensure alignment across digital skills, growth priorities and our pricing initiatives. This is the first time we have reviewed our definition since we updated it in 2020. Under the new definition, Q4 '21 digital revenue would have been about 49% of total revenue, approximately 4 points higher than the 45% we previously reported. For this quarter only, we are also providing some additional information to highlight the change in our digital definition. Under our previous definition, digital would have grown 18% in Q1, and represented approximately 47% of revenue. As Brian mentioned, Q1 bookings grew 4% year-over-year, which resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.4 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 unchanged from Q4. We believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our full year growth ambitions. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 6%. Trends within this segment were consistent with last quarter as positive momentum within our North American banking business and improved performance in insurance were offset by softness in our global banking portfolio. Q1 growth also included a negative 130 basis point impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. We remain focused on investing in our talent and digital capabilities aligned to our strategy. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 9%, primarily organic, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies within our life sciences business, around digitization of clinical trial processes and modernization of manufacturing operations. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 15%, driven by double-digit growth across all subsectors within the segment. Segment growth also benefited from recently completed acquisitions, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to growth. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 20%, primarily organic reflecting growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients, which has continued to support growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth continued to be led by life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and communications and technology clients. Our global growth markets, which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 17% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by 20-plus percent growth in the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology segments. We also continue to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our recent acquisitions. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin declined by approximately 20 basis points. The largest headwind remains increased compensation costs, including the cost of subcontractors. Partially offsetting these headwinds were delivery efficiencies, slowing growth of SG&A and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 23.3%, and the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which benefited from discrete items, which we do not expect to repeat. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.07, and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.08. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion and net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q1 was $186 million, representing approximately 33% of net income. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our softest quarter for free cash flow, primarily due to the timing of bonus payments. DSO of 72 days increased by 3 days sequentially and by 2 days year-over-year. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $444 million on our share repurchase program and returned $143 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6.8% to 7.8% or 9.3% to 10.3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year, we are increasing the organic growth outlook assumption in our guidance, reflecting strong performance in our digital portfolio and a healthy demand backdrop. However, we are tightening our constant currency outlook at both ends of the range, which reflects our improved organic revenue growth. This is partially offset by a lower expectation of inorganic growth, which we now expect to contribute approximately 100 basis points to full year growth versus 200 basis points previously. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 180 basis points impact from currency versus 70 points previously, which equates to roughly $200 million headwind in reported revenues. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance range of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion representing 4.2% to 9.2% growth or 10% to 11% in constant currency. This compares to our previous guidance of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, which represented growth of 7.8% to 10.8% or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. While we did not complete any acquisitions in Q1, we remain active in pursuit of acquisitions aligned with our strategy. We will stay disciplined as we analyze the acquisition pipeline, and thoughtful, as we assess the best use of capital. For the full year, we expect to return at least $600 million through share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints and elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margin include increased compensation costs, T&E and return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. We currently expect to see some gradual improvement in our operating margin in Q2. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.55 compared to $4.46 to $4.60 previously, which primarily reflects the FX impact on our reported revenue outlook. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million and average share outstanding of approximately 522 million, both unchanged from our prior outlook. We also continue to expect a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we are still targeting full year cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. However, there are several moving pieces that could cause us to fall below our goal. Key factors impacting our conversion rate include the timing of certain payments, cash taxes and higher CapEx. We remain focused on our working capital initiatives to offset these headwinds for the remainder of the year. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: . First question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just I want to ask on bookings up 4%. You said that was in line. I think the math -- I guess my simple math suggests that it's a pretty solid book-to-bill in the quarter 2 in addition to the trailing 12-month figure that you shared. Is that accurate? And maybe can you give us a little bit more on why you're confident in the acceleration to close the year in bookings?\nBrian Humphries: Tien-Tsin, it's Brian here. So look, all in all, we actually had an exceptional Q3, Q4 in bookings, if you remember, both quarters were up in excess of 20% year-over-year. And so some of that, there's natural behavior in a commercial team to pull in bookings in the latter part of the year to maximize their variable compensation. So the compares what the compare is. But I feel very good about where we are, a book-to-bill of 1.2, the book-to-bill in the quarter is fine too and generally good momentum behind digital bookings as well. So our pipeline plus the book-to-bill ratio, which is very healthy at this moment in time, give me confidence that we continue to do the right thing. On the contrary, we don't really have what I would view a demand issue as an industry that is faced with elevated attrition. The trick is always to optimize how much you want to sell, otherwise, you end up frustrating clients if you can't deliver against it. So it's more a demand supply and balance labor cost and attrition dilemma than a top line dilemma at this moment in time. Now in the same vein, I'll be the first to say that the economic backdrop is uncertain. And therefore, we continue to monitor, as you do on a daily and weekly basis the war in Europe, the inflation or the risk of stagflation, to broader economic sentiment, of course, and how this may impact not just us, but our clients and therefore, indirectly us. But at this moment in time, despite an uncertain backdrop, I'm certainly optimistic about the IT services demand picture for the foreseeable future and our role within that.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. Yes. No, that's encouraging and fair. So I guess my quick follow-up just on the inorganic change in the outlook. Is that a function of maybe some deals falling out of the pipeline or just a timing issue with what you've seen year-to-date? Just anything else to add there, that would be great.\nBrian Humphries: I would say, Jan and I are quite judicious when it comes to M&A, quite disciplined, very intentional, and we tend to step out of certain deals. If they don't make economic sense, we're here to represent shareholders. Of course, we're custodians of the company. And in some cases, it's been us stepping out. In some cases, there are deals that we weren't able to get done or we weren't able to get the counterparty to engage. There's no fundamental change to our We continue to view that as a core element of our capital allocation framework, certainly a core element of us executing against our strategy. And where we do M&A, we'll be in tune with our digital aspirations, key vertical aspirations, geographic expansion and of course, our desire to be a little bit more advisory led. In certain deals, you hit multiple birds with the 1 stone. You can have an international deal that is aligned to a digital priority that is aligned to a key industry. And so it's more of the same going forward. It can be choppy. Sometimes you get more higher return average, but we feel pretty good about our strategy and how M&A will play a role within that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: So I just wanted to follow up here on an outlook. First, just to unpack the revised revenue outlook. So you took down the inorganic by 100 bps and the FX headwind was obviously a little bit more than 2x what it was before. So collectively about $385 million of headwind versus the prior view. So I just wanted to clarify that, that was really the big piece there with obviously a little bit better organic. And then just on the M&A, just going forward, is it more fair to assume, let's say, a range, 100 bps to 200 bps a year versus a specific target, just given potential lumpiness?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. It's a good comment. I'll start to tackle the M&A stuff first. I think we should expect a little bit of bumpiness in M&A just by the nature of it. And so it's fair to say we haven't really changed our capital allocation framework. So I think the general guideline that is on Brian\u2019s and my mind is still a 2% thing. I think in this case, we had a couple of deals that fell out of the pipeline for the reasons that Brian described. And as we outlook, we see a little bit more activity in the third and fourth quarter happening. So we just felt it was prudent to let you know about that. There's no change. It's just like these are discrete items and in 1 or 2 deals can make a little bit of a difference. But no change for the medium-term outlook. I think we're sticking with our 2% revenue growth and 50% of our free cash flow allocation to M&A. On the guidance, I think you got it right. We basically took the inorganic down by 100 bps, and we increased the organic constant currency at the same rate. So we are sticking with our same organic -- constant currency revenue, not organic, but all in constant currency revenue was sticking at the same midpoint.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. And then just on margin, has the margin progression gone as planned as it relates to maybe the timing of investments that you had budgeted for in 2022? Curious if just the wage inflation has shifted anything around for you? And maybe help us with the cadence of how we go forward from here on operating margin.\nJan Siegmund: No, I appreciate that. You're familiar that our margin profile throughout the year has a typical curve with the second and third quarter being stronger, and we anticipate this year to have a typical curvature, so to speak, on margin. Clearly, you have seen an increased pressure on compensation costs. And so, we have built into our forecast, of course, offsetting measures relative to improvement in our cost to delivery efficiencies, investment into automation. We have -- of course, pricing is rolling out throughout the 4 quarters and will gain throughout the year. So all these things have to be coming together in order for us to achieve the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion, which is our best outlook right now that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush.\nMoshe Katri: I have 2. Can you maybe get some more color on subcontractor use? I think you indicated that was 1 of the factors impacting margins for the quarter, maybe kind of look at that versus percentage of revenues where has it been trending? And then on top of that, maybe some color on the weakness you mentioned in your banking portfolio. Is that the same kind of issue that we've had during the past few years? Or is that anything different?\nJan Siegmund: You broke up in the second question, the weakness in...\nMoshe Katri: In your banking portfolio? And you indicated -- and the question is, whether this was the same weakness that we've been talking about for a couple of years now in BFSI. \nJan Siegmund: Oh, BFS. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yes. So we don't really break out our subcontractor cost explicitly for you. But the biggest impact on our operating margin by far is really a merit in off-cycle and then pair that with the subcontractor hiring. So it's just a bigger factor as you would expect, higher attrition leads to some of that use. But I don't think we're breaking it out publicly, but those were the major factors on BFS continues to be on a good path. We see steady expansion. I mentioned in my call that Samlink went out of the revenue that put a little bit of pressure in the European banking and financial services revenue growth. But overall, we see a steady improvement that shows that we are on the right path here. There's actually increased digital bookings. There are core projects, as Brian mentioned in his call that are driving up. So as we -- I think Brian used on this call, the continued and steady improvement for BFS is kind of where we are. We're not at the end of our work here, but we're feeling we are on solid ground.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Sure. I'll start with the inflation question. And specifically, I know you called out you're taking some pricing actions. Can you just elaborate a bit on what components of revenue will be affected? Is this mostly in your kind of materials business that you'll be able to affect through pricing? And then also a bit of a more strategic question on inflation, how is it affecting your clients' agendas or mix of work at this point?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. We have clearly -- pricing is always part of our business model, and many of our clients obviously have regular price increases built into their contracts. But I think the extraordinary situation of wage inflation and cost pressure that also our clients' experience has, I think, opened more opportunities for us to drive pricing initiatives across the entire company. And I think we are deploying really a variety of approaches. Each client a little bit individualized to it. But once we're finding basically for many clients, receptivity. So it will be still hard. We are in the business of generating benefit and value for our clients. But the discussions from what I can see have been starting and have been constructive with our clients. So I'm expecting pricing to build momentum and help us to contribute to the margin expansion throughout the next 3 quarters.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up question just on the BPO call out. Brian, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted again now this been a couple of quarters in a row, the strengthened BPO. Can you just elaborate what service line specifically, like which verticals is that showing are you sort of leaning into that opportunity, which seems to have come out of the tight labor market in the back of the pandemic.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Lisa. Look, the team has done an extraordinary job. I would say not just in this quarter or recent quarters. But in the last few years, we exited, as you know, content moderation. That has been a large driver of growth in that business, and we executed it seamlessly. We repivoted the company more towards certain categories, notably around intelligent process automation, ultimately contextualized to industry-specific use cases as well as a very strong focus on the digital native clients. But not just has that been a success story in its own right, we're also, Lisa, in every 1 of our 4 externally reportable segments, growing our BPO business in not just along the lines of digital natives. Margins have been improving, and we're obviously now using this to try to get pull through to the, let's say, tech services portion of the company. The -- if you think about our BPO business, I mean fundamentally, it's historically been about 80% aligned to verticalized plays. We continue to strengthen our hand in that regard, but we're also looking in other growth postures, including F&A and CRM and doing that in conjunction with partners and starting to see a pipeline behind that as well. So we have, I would say, very strong client references, a lot of swagger in that group that are consistently beating their forecasts and budgets. And that swagger correlates to broad-based momentum across indeed across all 4 verticals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citibank.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: I guess I wanted to ask with regards to any indirect or flow-through impact you may have seen from the war in Ukraine, either clients coming to you to potentially move work away from East European clients or East European locations with other vendors or subcontractor work that might come your way or even on the supply side, any increased pricing wage pressure?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Ashwin, look, generally, we don't really have any exposures to Ukraine or Russia and are now significant operations there whatsoever. And I would say, at this moment in time, we've seen no material impact of the conflict on client demand either. Of course, we'll continue to monitor that situation. One, we have had clients come our way. I mean we're clearly aware of our digital engineering strength and our ambition to scale further there. I actually think if I stand back from the here and now, I believe that the implications will be lasting and that our scale in India, which we're actually tying into our digital studios around the rest of the world, which are very much part of our digital and global delivery network, they'll ultimately help us distinguish ourselves. And ultimately, as clients are assessing their vendors and strategic partners, and in particular, as digital becomes mainstream, I suspect that scaled players like Cognizant will stand to win in the long term. And India will continue to be an asset for us. And if you just think about the last few years in the COVID period, there's been a number of points mix shift to offshore, notwithstanding the industry scaling towards digital. And I think that will stand Cognizant in good stead given the tremendous strength and talent we have across India.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood. And with regards to just talking about wage inflation and pricing trends, I know there are many nuances as it relates to the ability to proactively pass price increases to clients, when you can do that, the number of times a year or the call or definitions, things like that. Could you sort of walk through what you're seeing areas?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. I'll start and Jan, why don't you jump in if needed. Ashwin, I think, first of all, pricing is extremely topical at this moment time, given the services companies are knowledge-based organizations and therefore, our supply chain for wanted a better word is our talent. And as costs of our people go up, by definition, we have an obligation to, in one form or another, either automate, change the pyramid, change the offshoring mix or near-shoring mix and/or find a way to pass on cost to clients, notwithstanding automation agendas or whatnot. So I think at this stage, pricing is mainstream in terms of dialogue amongst not just Cognizant, but also our peers in the industry to try to offset the compensation pressure. So the classic situation that we have grown up with historically around MSAs being signed with rate cards associated with those and rate cards coming up for renewal every 1 or 2 years, that is not necessarily as relevant anymore because people have to intersect those natural cycles. Now on top of that, I'd just point out that well, as Jan said, we have a pricing initiative underway. Clearly, the business model evolution of Cognizant, which has been quite intentional in recent years, including a much greater shift towards digital and the commitment to try to evolve from being a provider of resources to be a solution provider that enables clients to address their pain points by a selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes, that puts us in a position where we are competing with sometimes very different competitors and we may have some margin opportunity via pricing leverage as well. So both of those factors, I think, are pertinent at this moment in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research.\nRod Bourgeois : I just want to ask about acquisitions that you've completed in the past couple of years and how you're performing against the revenue and synergy targets on those acquisitions. And I would also ask if you could include any kind of update on TriZetto. I know that you made some good turnaround progress in that business' growth last year. And it would be helpful to hear your latest thoughts also on TriZetto's growth trajectory.\nJan Siegmund: Hey, Rod, I'll take your second question first. TriZetto had actually -- interesting that you're asking -- the best product sales quarter ever in the history this quarter. So the product modernization that we had undergone with TriZetto continues to show benefit and so they are doing really well and the pull through implementation services and other services to it.  Relative to the M&A performance. We had -- our M&A portfolio is performing well against our budget, and we are generating actually revenue synergies as we had planned for. And I think we have probably a little bit more work to do to counter the margin dilution that our M&A does. But I'll give you 1 example. Our Softvision acquisition that we did now a number of years ago is now the core basis of our digital engineering business, and we're really integrating our entire engineering practice, digital engineering practice based on the Softvision model. So I would describe our M&A program is largely successful as a portfolio. Now you always have in a portfolio of companies, some that are not doing quite as well, but as a portfolio, we are very satisfied with the progress we're making on M&A.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. You could have just said TriZetto's performance is so good, it can make you cough, but that's my bad analyst humor.\nJan Siegmund: I'm sorry. I'm a little bit under the weather with a little bit of a cough. So sorry for that, Rod.\nRod Bourgeois: Understood. Hey, just on the attrition front, is the attrition challenge starting to abate? And what levers are being pulled that give you some encouragement about where that might be going from here? Where are you getting some benefit on the efforts that you're making to attract and retain talent?\nBrian Humphries: Rod, it's Brian. So first of all, we're delighted. We've reduced voluntary attrition for 2 quarters in a row. This quarter, attrition fell 5 points sequentially on a voluntary basis, and we are extremely comprehensive in our disclosure of attrition perhaps the purest in the industry. That being said, I actually anticipate attrition will pick up in the second quarter. In fact, I know attrition will pick up because we look at resignations on a daily basis, and we anticipate it will be elevated for the course of the year. We have done a tremendous amount in the last year. We call this early. We substantially overspent our allocated budget last year for compensation and promotions because we wanted to invest in our talent try to mitigate attrition and make sure we capture the market opportunity. But this is above and beyond simply financial measures. It's total rewards, vacation policy, 401(k) policy, stock purchase price policy, et cetera, within total awards. And on top of that then, there's a significant amount that we've been doing around investing in our employees, whether that is skilling or indeed enabling career path advancements, Cognizant as you know very well, has always been a company that invested heavily in our people, attracted smart people, put them into accounts and really enable ourselves to ingratiate ourselves at accounts. Well, we've furthered that in the last year by doing what I would view as clever things with regards to our promotion process, really trying to make this a little bit more self-service and constant through the course of the year by tying it much greater to skilling as opposed to longevity of tenure and making sure that we try to correlate that with bill rate increases as well. And then there's a broader notion of us getting back on the front foot growing double digits, which creates career path opportunities for people and upward mobility and just a celebratory sense of winning bigger deals, winning in digital and delivering with success. Now all of that comes against the backdrop of us also in the course of the last few years taking some pain by really balancing our visa dependency in North America given the regulatory backdrop as well. But the heavy lifting of that is now essentially behind us. So we've been working very hard to mitigate attrition. But the reality is the market is red hot behind certain skills and try as we might, and we track the data when we promote people or when we give them salary increases. We know how long it mitigate attrition before it picks up again. So I just think this industry is perhaps at a different curve than it was in the last 15 to 20 years, perhaps the return to office are much more of a hybrid work will help mitigate what we've seen in the last year, but I'm still somewhat pessimistic about the industry attrition trends.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Brian, I was wondering if you could address headcount growth, a number of quarters here of nice strong double-digit headcount growth in spite of attrition, although attrition has been improving. Can you maybe unpack that growth a little bit and give us a little bit of insight around have you been able to improved lateral hiring. Are you making some digital ads? Is this primarily freshers that you're bringing on board? And how that might translate into revenue related -- I guess, headcount-related revenue growth going forward?\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Well, the holy grail of course, in a services company is somehow to decouple headcount growth and revenue growth, but there are multiple factors at play, including accelerators and the mix of their headcount onshore versus offshore and indeed within the pyramid. Clearly, if I start with the pyramid, at the bottom of the pyramid, I felt 3 years ago, we were light. We hadn't been as aggressive on campus hiring, et cetera. And in the last few years, we have really, I would say, materially changed our hiring practices, 17,000 a few years ago, 33,000 freshers onboarded and infused in the last year. And then we're aiming for 45,000, 50,000 this coming year. And I'm assuming that will continue to grow. So that by definition, adds headcount at lower levels from a billing perspective. And clearly, as you go through rightsize that, then you bring people on board, you get them trained for a few months, you infuse them into accounts and ultimately get them into more billable type roles. So that's been 1 factor where you've seen us materially add headcount. And I think it's fundamentally so core to our success in the years ahead because with those people being skilled and with this internal job moves program that creates upward mobility in our organization, we are therefore able to promote from within more often, particularly when we have fixed bid or managed services type deals versus a more traditional deal staff augmentation or interview-based role. The second factor I'd say is our mix has shifted like many in the industry, about 2 points towards offshore in the last year, and that has different dynamics in terms of average bill rate per employee or margin dollars per employee but also margin rate per employee can be higher in offshore. But the attrition that we're experiencing, I think, as an industry and within Cognizant is broad-based. It's not just in India, it's not just in the junior levels of the organization. It's also across Western Europe and North America. So we are continuing to complement the programs we put in place with incremental campus programs in North America, nearshore programs in Mexico and Canada, which are ramping nicely for us, and of course, the need for subcontractors and laterals. Subcontractors actually fell sequentially in mid-single digits, and that's something we'd obviously like to continue to optimize in the years ahead by getting more campus programs, more upward mobility and better demand visibility such that we can avoid as much subcontractors. And then last but not least, one of our core competencies, I would argue, has been our talent acquisition group, we've done remarkable work in the last year or so. Certainly, the offer to join a ratio has eroded in the industry and Cognizant is no different. But nonetheless, we have an incredible capability to bring in tens of thousands of employees per quarter. And I'm firmly of the opinion we're not yet hitting our stride in terms of our revenue potential. So we want to continue to scale our operations to get after the market possibilities that are out there.\nBrian Essex: Got it. Very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a quick follow-up for Jan. On FX, maybe any way to quantify the contribution from rupee depreciation versus the dollar and how you might be thinking about that going forward given the margin guidance you've given?\nJan Siegmund: Actually the rupee movement going forward, which is largely affecting basically, of course, our cost base is, as you know, moderated by our hedging program. So we really don't make an assumption around this. In the quarter, I think I mentioned in the script that the rupee did contribute about 50 basis points in a set of ups and downs to our margin. But that may help you a little bit to extrapolate for what it is. So this is largely driven by our revenue forecast that's going to be the euro and the pound are going to be the most impactful one in that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman : I'll ask my 2 questions concurrently since they're related. Brian, first for you. When you last -- since you last gave guidance, based on our discussions with folks in India, in particular, it seems like wage rates have actually moved against you. In other words, wage rates have gotten more expensive even over the last 90 days. And assuming that supposition is true, I'm just -- what is going right that allows you to maintain the margin guidance even with perhaps wage rates getting more onerous. So perhaps you assumed in the previous continue to move against you. But is it as simple as pricing? Because when we do our calcs on the rupee exchange rate, it's not enough to offset the change in waste rates even over the last 90 days. So, a, what is going right that helped you maintain the guidance? And are you comfortable that, in fact, with the current wage rate structure, you're leaving enough room as you said, to strengthen your hand or invest appropriately for the longer term?\nBrian Humphries : Well, we have continued to invest in the company. As you know, over the last few years, our SG&A has outgrown revenue and margin dollars substantially on a year-over-year basis for a whole host of initiatives, from IT security to marketing to reinvigorating the commercial momentum story that is now few in the growth that we're seeing. Keith, by definition, it's not an easy environment. By definition, when we look at forward guidance, we anticipate not just the here and now, but month and quarter, we have more lateral layers that we're bringing in from the outside, which are coming in at rates.  But I still feel in the same vein that the negatives of labor cost increases, the attrition impact on utilization, the increased costs associated with travel and entertainment and return to office, we still have possibilities to offset that with moderated SG&A growth, with revenue growth leverage, pyramid optimization, shoring optimization, automation, real estate and, of course, pricing. And arguably, pricing is the big one. We are seeing some nice green shoots there. It's a programmatic approach that Jan and I are heavily invested in with our pricing team globally and with the markets to make sure that we have the courage to talk to clients around the importance of investing in our people, which will help mitigate attrition on their accounts and the various other actions we're taking. So pricing is ultimately the factor that gives us an ability to maintain margin growth of 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year.\nKeith Bachman: Right. In other words, those pricing discussions, even since the beginning of the year, those are perhaps a bit more favorable where clients are willing to listen or it's a more equitable discussion at least it sound.\nBrian Humphries: Yes. Look, let's face it. I mean in every C-Suite conversation that I have as I go around the world, we all end up talking about multiple things around return to offers, hybrid work, culture and also about labor and supply chain disruption. And many clients over the years, as you know, have brought certain skills in-house and they're all dealing with the same trends we are dealing with ourselves in terms of elevated attrition and labor cost increases. So it is quite topical. It's quite known for our client base, and we're not the only company in the world approaching clients outside of standard renewal dates to intersect the classic rate card work. It's heavy lifting. It's not easy. I want to call out my team globally. We've worked very hard in the last 9 months to mitigate this to navigate our way through certain icebergs. And we know we've got some heavy lifting ahead of us as well. But the team are committed to do so. And we keep, obviously, everybody current on a quarter-by-quarter basis and see how much progress we can make in this regard.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Brian, just to clarify, you did say that you've had a really nice move in quarter attrition over 2 quarters. You said it would go back up in June due to some seasonal factors. But do you think it flattens out there, even declines as you look at the back half of the calendar year? Or do you think it kind of stays at these elevated levels? Can you make progress in attrition, if you look over the horizon from the June quarter?\nBrian Humphries: We just don't know. It's very hard to call, Keith. The reality is that attrition slows based on a series of financial measures we've made, serious promotion measures we've made. But obviously, there are elements of seasonality at play here as bonuses are paid, which triggered an increase in attrition in the last few months. And so therefore, I know that attrition will go up in Q2, and that's factored into our guidance. Once we get past Q2, we're just going to have to keep a close eye on this and see how we're able to continue to engage employees. I actually believe that the environment we're in these days, which I think we've hit a watershed moment of people no longer necessarily wanting to work in an office environment like in the past can be detrimental to employee engagement and cultural affinity and indeed can enable people to work more remotely. And then in countries like India, the notion of moving from a large urban center to a rural environment, trying to encourage people back to an urban environment can have meaningful consequences for their disposable income at the end of the month. So there's not just a philosophical debate in terms of whether you can commit your work on remotely leveraging technology, but it's very much a financial debate as well, notwithstanding the broader inflationary pressure in the urban centers or indeed in rural. So I'm somewhat of the opinion that we're at a new norm, the labor market as we set. And with that new approach to work, industry attrition may pick up on a more sustainable basis, particularly in today's demand environment, where I still feel that digital transformation is clearly throughout multiple industries, and there's a lot more legs on this in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Just on -- kind of a follow-up question on pricing. Can you talk a little bit about -- well, historically, you've talked about there being a gap between your current pricing and the pricing you command in some of your acquisitions. Where are we in terms of closing the gap? And how much incremental benefit do you think can come from that this year?\nJan Siegmund: I think I don't want to go into all the details of the pricing opportunity, but you're pointing out, I think, a key element of -- that is playing a little bit in our favor. The shift towards digital is on its own helping because we have a higher gross margin in our digital business. We're focusing, obviously, also on the pricing of these high-end demand resources. And so that gives a little bit more pricing opportunities. Also these projects tend to be a little bit shorter term compared to other long-term contractual things. So in that area, we're going to expect to make some progress, and I think our clients have also shown more receptivity in the area of these set of digital skills to discuss pricing with us. So I think that's helping. So you have a double effect of driving higher share using our acquisitions and pricing levels that have been established by our acquisitions as a guide to establish better pricing levels for the entire enterprise. So I think you're intuitively pointing out 1 area that gives us -- is definitely part of our overall thinking relative to revenue generation. There's also an element, if I come back to the question is really the overall margin discussion and pricing has been a focus on this call. But we do have, with our shift towards hiring of Gen Zs dramatically shifted our cost pyramid development and the internal promotions not only help, of course, generating better group happening for our associates, but also help us to mitigate the cost of lateral hires. And we hope that as we execute on our strategy of increased Gen Z hiring that -- and we plan on cost efficiencies and in our delivery model, helping in a similar way to offset the compensation pressure that we're good seeing just on wages, basically.\nJames Faucette : Got it. Got it. And then how would you talk about -- and maybe just for you, Brian, how do you feel about the current state of your delivery organization and even outside of attrition, obviously, attrition and hiring is always going to be a challenge for delivery. But how are you feeling about that structurally and skill wise, et cetera? And any unique challenges outside of hiring and attrition that you want to make sure you try to address as we go through the rest of this year?\nBrian Humphries : I'm very proud of our delivery organization. At the end of the day, Cognizant is a delivery company, whatever we sell a little more than a commitment to actually go and deliver against that. And come what may in the last few years, humanitarian crisis, a cyber attack and of course, in today's elevated industry attrition. Our delivery team have gone the extra mile time and time again to satisfy client demand and juggle various balls. So I'd like to complement them. We, of course, are complementing India as well by bolstering that with a global delivery network in Europe, in North America, onshore as well as nearshore locations. So they've done a really nice job for us. As we evolve the way we show up the clients and lead with advisory capabilities to sell solutions and deliver outcomes by industry, addressing client pain points, of course, there is an evolution that's happening in our delivery organization. And that includes how we solution and project and program management, and of course, the degree of efficiencies and accelerators we're able to use within our portfolio. And that's something we're making good progress on. And at some stage in the future, we'll talk more about that externally. But our delivery organization is the heart of Cognizant. I, frankly, was in India probably 4, 5 weeks ago, I'll be back there in the coming month or 2 as well. A lot of my team have been there in more recent weeks. I actually characterized the morale and the vibe amongst the delivery organization to be perhaps the highest it's been in the last 3 years. I really feel very good about where we are, notwithstanding the pressure everybody has been under given these either self-imposed or exogenous events.\nOperator: We have time for 1 more question. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Thanks for fitting me in. I'll keep it short here. I guess, I know focus of the company has been to do larger deals, just get an update on how that pipeline looks and if you're being able to close some of the larger deals? And then kind of the secondly, is there a bookings about? I know we started at 4%, you're talking about an acceleration. I know we've done mid-teens the last couple of years, just trying to get our models set up correctly.\nBrian Humphries : Yes. Look, I think fundamentally, given the revenue guidance Jan and I gave in November last year in the multiyear outlook as well as the current guidance for 2022, we've got to maintain a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1 or above. That's certainly directionally what's going to be needed for us to achieve those goals. I always think it's very important to underscore the importance of thinking about bookings across a trading 12-month basis. And to your point, Bryan, we've had some very strong years now the last 2. And from my perspective, we are in a much better position than that and we've been at any stage as I came here a few years ago. And I feel good about our win rate, and I feel good or better pipeline within that. So that's kind of my perspective in terms of bookings and our readiness to get after the market opportunity in the years ahead. The demand picture is less concerned than the attrition and labor cost concerns.\nBryan Keane : And what about larger deals, Brian?\nBrian Humphries : Larger deals, trailing 12-month basis, we've got $23.4 billion of bookings without substantial large deals within that. And I view that as a positive because our digital momentum has really picked up. But certainly, with, I would say, strong delivery capabilities, strengthening project and program management, strengthening solution name, discipline within Cognizant. We are continuing to review the opportunity to get into some larger deals. And hopefully, we'll have some good news for you on that in the next few quarters. Some of those will be aligned to really us like FSI, where we've done some good work in portfolio. We cleaned -- refreshed our client-facing teams, both in delivery as well as in commercial, and we've got a very strong industry solutions group that needs to continue to get stronger. And we've been spending a lot of time with clients that we haven't sold to in recent years, and I think we have the opportunity to get into some of those larger accounts as well. So hopefully, you'll see something in the coming quarters in that regard. But our momentum has ultimately been carried by digital momentum, the reinvigoration of our commercial sales team and client centricity at our core, clearly, a broader portfolio that's more compelling than ever before, which has been intentionally built to exposures to higher growth categories. Our international expansion, I'll call out the UK, our second largest country after the U.S. growing consistently now. 20% plus is a really strong post-merger integration opportunity to scale into our accounts. If we can complement all of that with a few larger deals per year, that will be done opportunistically judiciously. There's a lot of potential left in this company, and I really feel good about that.\nBrian Humphries : Okay. With that, thank you very much for joining us today, and we look\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Humphries",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks to our talented employees, we delivered on our first quarter commitments in what continues to be an intensely competitive global labor market. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, up 10.9% year-over-year in constant currency, above the midpoint of our first quarter guidance of 10.2% to 11.2% growth. Growth was led by digital, which grew 20% year-over-year and now represents 50% of our revenue. We had another exceptional quarter in digital business operations, which continues to meaningfully outgrow the BPO market reflecting momentum in intelligent process automation and digital native clients. First quarter operating margin was 15%, down slightly sequentially as expected, reflecting seasonality. First quarter bookings growth of 4% was in line with our expectations following exceptional bookings growth in the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have a robust book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.2x revenue reflecting bookings of over $23 billion. Given a healthy pipeline, we anticipate bookings growth acceleration in the second quarter and for the full year. Over the last 3 months, I've met employees, partners and clients across 4 continents. While the global economic environment is uncertain, based on these interactions, I remain optimistic about IT services industry demand for the foreseeable future. Clients are making the shift to digital operating models to become more agile, automated and innovative. They know that it is the only way to deliver customer-centric user experience and hyper personalization, to simplify complex workflows and to build a modern operating infrastructure that's Our strategic repositioning enables us to engage more deeply with clients, helping them to succeed and supports our growth trajectory. Our capabilities are in strong demand as digital becomes mainstream. Ultimately, I believe that our scale in India, complemented by our growing global delivery network, will differentiate us as clients seek talent and business stability. Meanwhile, the labor market continues to be attrition, demand supply imbalances and inflationary pressure. I'd like to thank our teams across the globe for their leadership, patience and engagement as we navigate these challenges and execute against our client commitments. Today, more than ever, employees demand that we invest not just in total rewards, including compensation, but also in the end-to-end employee experience, their skilling and career advancement. Cognizant has always been known for our investment in our people. And in the last year, we built in this legacy with accelerated skilling and enhancements to our promotion framework. First quarter voluntary attrition fell 5 points to 26% on an annualized basis or 29% on a trailing 12-month basis. While we made sequential progress reducing voluntary attrition for the second consecutive quarter, we anticipate attrition will remain elevated for the full year and will increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality. To mitigate labor cost increases and the investments we are making in our people, we continue to execute against a series of measures including our automation agenda, pyramid and shoring optimization and a deep pricing. Turning to the industry segments. In Financial Services, our ongoing recovery continue with growth of 6% year-over-year in constant currency reflecting the sale of our Samlink subsidiary in February, continue to make progress repositioning the business towards higher growth and higher value services and solutions with a more focused client set. We expect to pace recovery in banking and insurance to continue with strong demand for digital transformation. One client whose digital transformation journey we've been supporting is ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. We are transforming the bank's IT landscape into a hybrid cloud platform with a focus on security and regulatory compliance. We'll be implementing an end-to-end secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure as a service model in support of the bank's IT modernization agenda. In health care, revenue grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency, with particularly strong growth in Life Sciences. Our investments to modernize the TriZetto product portfolio, which includes the integration of AI and machine learning capabilities continued to pay off. Our clients are responding to our commitment to deliver next-generation platform solutions that help them offer patients real-time insights and personalized care. We're keeping our products cutting edge, building new solutions across the value chain and capitalizing on the opportunity at the intersection of health and digital in areas such as virtual care and telehealth. During the first quarter, we announced our collaboration with Microsoft to deliver a new digital health solution designed to improve medical care. Leveraging Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, our new solution is the first of several planned offerings that combine remote patient monitoring and virtual health using products like smart watches, blood pressure monitors and glucose meters to collect and communicate patient health data to providers. Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield, a leading health insurer with more than 2 million members is a great example of how we're partnering with AWS to drive digital transformation. Wellmark aims to improve the experience of their stakeholders by accelerating cloud migration and data modernization, all while strengthening their information security. In Products and Resources, we continue to see excellent growth in client success across travel and hospitality and in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities. Automation is top of mind for clients like Pacific Gas and Electric, which sought our help to realize their vision for a new digital productivity center of excellence that aims to reduce manual efforts, simplify their automation tools and provide agile and scalable solutions for their business and IT users. To that end, our IPA team helped deploy Microsoft Power platform and simplified our tool sets with Cognizant Neuro, our recently announced intelligent automation fabric. PG&E is now well on its way to saving 1 million hours of work through low code, no code automation. Finally, in Communications, Media and Technology, we saw continued strength in technology, where we've sustained double-digit growth over the last 4 quarters. I'd like to briefly switch gears now to the future of work, a universal topic amongst the C-Suite with enduring societal implications. Organizations around the world are deliberating how to best attract, engage and retain employees. The events of the past few years have prompted people worldwide to question their life and work choices, including how and where they work. In the meantime, executive teams are determining how to best nurture company culture and values in the face of today's labor market realities and a hybrid work environment. These socioeconomic questions also intersect with business practicalities such as real estate strategy, one of the many things we are currently reviewing. One of the prominent business themes of our time is the relationship between purpose and work. Purpose encompasses all the values that drive people's choices, actions and attitudes from wider social and environmental goals to professional and personal objectives such as a healthy work-life balance. That's 1 reason we put so much time, thought and energy into developing and activating a compelling purpose, vision and set of values for our company, which express our commitment to making a positive impact on the environment and the wider society. We continue to advance our ESG agenda, applying our knowledge, portfolio and partnerships to engineer new levels of environmental and social benefits for our company, clients and communities. In April, we announced that we will source 100% renewable energy for all our global offices and facilities by the end of 2026. Sourcing 100% renewable energy supports our goal, and as last year, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and responds to client expectations that business transition to a low-carbon economy. We also want our employees, clients, partners and other stakeholders to better understand today's Cognizant, which is why during the first quarter, we modernized and reintroduced our brand to mirror the company we've become, the services leader with world-class digital solutions and talent. Our brand now carries the tagline, Intuition Engineered. This is our promise to engineer clients' businesses so they can anticipate and meet their customers' needs with the insight and speed of intuition. As a global company, we will always stand with the right of people to choose a path of self-determination and democracy. Wave humanitarian relief efforts for Ukraine, Cognizant contributed $1 million in grants to several organizations that are delivering food, water, shelter, health care and economic assistance. We joined the international community in hoping that a path to lasting peace can be found soon. In closing, I believe we're strategically well positioned to capture a large growing addressable market and drive profitable revenue growth. A month ago, I marked my third year anniversary leading Cognizant. While we are a company in transition, our evolution has been significant across multiple dimensions. We're putting the company on a strong growth trajectory, and I'm optimistic about Cognizant's prospects as we bolster our portfolio judiciously, to not only build and run clients' technology foundations but also transform their enterprises into modern businesses. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who will cover the details of the quarter and our financial outlook before we take your questions. Jan, over to you. Tien-Tsin, it's Brian here. So look, all in all, we actually had an exceptional Q3, Q4 in bookings, if you remember, both quarters were up in excess of 20% year-over-year. And so some of that, there's natural behavior in a commercial team to pull in bookings in the latter part of the year to maximize their variable compensation. So the compares what the compare is. But I feel very good about where we are, a book-to-bill of 1.2, the book-to-bill in the quarter is fine too and generally good momentum behind digital bookings as well. So our pipeline plus the book-to-bill ratio, which is very healthy at this moment in time, give me confidence that we continue to do the right thing. On the contrary, we don't really have what I would view a demand issue as an industry that is faced with elevated attrition. The trick is always to optimize how much you want to sell, otherwise, you end up frustrating clients if you can't deliver against it. So it's more a demand supply and balance labor cost and attrition dilemma than a top line dilemma at this moment in time. Now in the same vein, I'll be the first to say that the economic backdrop is uncertain. And therefore, we continue to monitor, as you do on a daily and weekly basis the war in Europe, the inflation or the risk of stagflation, to broader economic sentiment, of course, and how this may impact not just us, but our clients and therefore, indirectly us. But at this moment in time, despite an uncertain backdrop, I'm certainly optimistic about the IT services demand picture for the foreseeable future and our role within that. I would say, Jan and I are quite judicious when it comes to M&A, quite disciplined, very intentional, and we tend to step out of certain deals. If they don't make economic sense, we're here to represent shareholders. Of course, we're custodians of the company. And in some cases, it's been us stepping out. In some cases, there are deals that we weren't able to get done or we weren't able to get the counterparty to engage. There's no fundamental change to our We continue to view that as a core element of our capital allocation framework, certainly a core element of us executing against our strategy. And where we do M&A, we'll be in tune with our digital aspirations, key vertical aspirations, geographic expansion and of course, our desire to be a little bit more advisory led. In certain deals, you hit multiple birds with the 1 stone. You can have an international deal that is aligned to a digital priority that is aligned to a key industry. And so it's more of the same going forward. It can be choppy. Sometimes you get more higher return average, but we feel pretty good about our strategy and how M&A will play a role within that. Yes. Lisa. Look, the team has done an extraordinary job. I would say not just in this quarter or recent quarters. But in the last few years, we exited, as you know, content moderation. That has been a large driver of growth in that business, and we executed it seamlessly. We repivoted the company more towards certain categories, notably around intelligent process automation, ultimately contextualized to industry-specific use cases as well as a very strong focus on the digital native clients. But not just has that been a success story in its own right, we're also, Lisa, in every 1 of our 4 externally reportable segments, growing our BPO business in not just along the lines of digital natives. Margins have been improving, and we're obviously now using this to try to get pull through to the, let's say, tech services portion of the company. The -- if you think about our BPO business, I mean fundamentally, it's historically been about 80% aligned to verticalized plays. We continue to strengthen our hand in that regard, but we're also looking in other growth postures, including F&A and CRM and doing that in conjunction with partners and starting to see a pipeline behind that as well. So we have, I would say, very strong client references, a lot of swagger in that group that are consistently beating their forecasts and budgets. And that swagger correlates to broad-based momentum across indeed across all 4 verticals. Yes. Ashwin, look, generally, we don't really have any exposures to Ukraine or Russia and are now significant operations there whatsoever. And I would say, at this moment in time, we've seen no material impact of the conflict on client demand either. Of course, we'll continue to monitor that situation. One, we have had clients come our way. I mean we're clearly aware of our digital engineering strength and our ambition to scale further there. I actually think if I stand back from the here and now, I believe that the implications will be lasting and that our scale in India, which we're actually tying into our digital studios around the rest of the world, which are very much part of our digital and global delivery network, they'll ultimately help us distinguish ourselves. And ultimately, as clients are assessing their vendors and strategic partners, and in particular, as digital becomes mainstream, I suspect that scaled players like Cognizant will stand to win in the long term. And India will continue to be an asset for us. And if you just think about the last few years in the COVID period, there's been a number of points mix shift to offshore, notwithstanding the industry scaling towards digital. And I think that will stand Cognizant in good stead given the tremendous strength and talent we have across India. Yes. I'll start and Jan, why don't you jump in if needed. Ashwin, I think, first of all, pricing is extremely topical at this moment time, given the services companies are knowledge-based organizations and therefore, our supply chain for wanted a better word is our talent. And as costs of our people go up, by definition, we have an obligation to, in one form or another, either automate, change the pyramid, change the offshoring mix or near-shoring mix and/or find a way to pass on cost to clients, notwithstanding automation agendas or whatnot. So I think at this stage, pricing is mainstream in terms of dialogue amongst not just Cognizant, but also our peers in the industry to try to offset the compensation pressure. So the classic situation that we have grown up with historically around MSAs being signed with rate cards associated with those and rate cards coming up for renewal every 1 or 2 years, that is not necessarily as relevant anymore because people have to intersect those natural cycles. Now on top of that, I'd just point out that well, as Jan said, we have a pricing initiative underway. Clearly, the business model evolution of Cognizant, which has been quite intentional in recent years, including a much greater shift towards digital and the commitment to try to evolve from being a provider of resources to be a solution provider that enables clients to address their pain points by a selling solutioning and delivering client outcomes, that puts us in a position where we are competing with sometimes very different competitors and we may have some margin opportunity via pricing leverage as well. So both of those factors, I think, are pertinent at this moment in time. Rod, it's Brian. So first of all, we're delighted. We've reduced voluntary attrition for 2 quarters in a row. This quarter, attrition fell 5 points sequentially on a voluntary basis, and we are extremely comprehensive in our disclosure of attrition perhaps the purest in the industry. That being said, I actually anticipate attrition will pick up in the second quarter. In fact, I know attrition will pick up because we look at resignations on a daily basis, and we anticipate it will be elevated for the course of the year. We have done a tremendous amount in the last year. We call this early. We substantially overspent our allocated budget last year for compensation and promotions because we wanted to invest in our talent try to mitigate attrition and make sure we capture the market opportunity. But this is above and beyond simply financial measures. It's total rewards, vacation policy, 401(k) policy, stock purchase price policy, et cetera, within total awards. And on top of that then, there's a significant amount that we've been doing around investing in our employees, whether that is skilling or indeed enabling career path advancements, Cognizant as you know very well, has always been a company that invested heavily in our people, attracted smart people, put them into accounts and really enable ourselves to ingratiate ourselves at accounts. Well, we've furthered that in the last year by doing what I would view as clever things with regards to our promotion process, really trying to make this a little bit more self-service and constant through the course of the year by tying it much greater to skilling as opposed to longevity of tenure and making sure that we try to correlate that with bill rate increases as well. And then there's a broader notion of us getting back on the front foot growing double digits, which creates career path opportunities for people and upward mobility and just a celebratory sense of winning bigger deals, winning in digital and delivering with success. Now all of that comes against the backdrop of us also in the course of the last few years taking some pain by really balancing our visa dependency in North America given the regulatory backdrop as well. But the heavy lifting of that is now essentially behind us. So we've been working very hard to mitigate attrition. But the reality is the market is red hot behind certain skills and try as we might, and we track the data when we promote people or when we give them salary increases. We know how long it mitigate attrition before it picks up again. So I just think this industry is perhaps at a different curve than it was in the last 15 to 20 years, perhaps the return to office are much more of a hybrid work will help mitigate what we've seen in the last year, but I'm still somewhat pessimistic about the industry attrition trends. Yes. Well, the holy grail of course, in a services company is somehow to decouple headcount growth and revenue growth, but there are multiple factors at play, including accelerators and the mix of their headcount onshore versus offshore and indeed within the pyramid. Clearly, if I start with the pyramid, at the bottom of the pyramid, I felt 3 years ago, we were light. We hadn't been as aggressive on campus hiring, et cetera. And in the last few years, we have really, I would say, materially changed our hiring practices, 17,000 a few years ago, 33,000 freshers onboarded and infused in the last year. And then we're aiming for 45,000, 50,000 this coming year. And I'm assuming that will continue to grow. So that by definition, adds headcount at lower levels from a billing perspective. And clearly, as you go through rightsize that, then you bring people on board, you get them trained for a few months, you infuse them into accounts and ultimately get them into more billable type roles. So that's been 1 factor where you've seen us materially add headcount. And I think it's fundamentally so core to our success in the years ahead because with those people being skilled and with this internal job moves program that creates upward mobility in our organization, we are therefore able to promote from within more often, particularly when we have fixed bid or managed services type deals versus a more traditional deal staff augmentation or interview-based role. The second factor I'd say is our mix has shifted like many in the industry, about 2 points towards offshore in the last year, and that has different dynamics in terms of average bill rate per employee or margin dollars per employee but also margin rate per employee can be higher in offshore. But the attrition that we're experiencing, I think, as an industry and within Cognizant is broad-based. It's not just in India, it's not just in the junior levels of the organization. It's also across Western Europe and North America. So we are continuing to complement the programs we put in place with incremental campus programs in North America, nearshore programs in Mexico and Canada, which are ramping nicely for us, and of course, the need for subcontractors and laterals. Subcontractors actually fell sequentially in mid-single digits, and that's something we'd obviously like to continue to optimize in the years ahead by getting more campus programs, more upward mobility and better demand visibility such that we can avoid as much subcontractors. And then last but not least, one of our core competencies, I would argue, has been our talent acquisition group, we've done remarkable work in the last year or so. Certainly, the offer to join a ratio has eroded in the industry and Cognizant is no different. But nonetheless, we have an incredible capability to bring in tens of thousands of employees per quarter. And I'm firmly of the opinion we're not yet hitting our stride in terms of our revenue potential. So we want to continue to scale our operations to get after the market possibilities that are out there. Well, we have continued to invest in the company. As you know, over the last few years, our SG&A has outgrown revenue and margin dollars substantially on a year-over-year basis for a whole host of initiatives, from IT security to marketing to reinvigorating the commercial momentum story that is now few in the growth that we're seeing. Keith, by definition, it's not an easy environment. By definition, when we look at forward guidance, we anticipate not just the here and now, but month and quarter, we have more lateral layers that we're bringing in from the outside, which are coming in at rates.  But I still feel in the same vein that the negatives of labor cost increases, the attrition impact on utilization, the increased costs associated with travel and entertainment and return to office, we still have possibilities to offset that with moderated SG&A growth, with revenue growth leverage, pyramid optimization, shoring optimization, automation, real estate and, of course, pricing. And arguably, pricing is the big one. We are seeing some nice green shoots there. It's a programmatic approach that Jan and I are heavily invested in with our pricing team globally and with the markets to make sure that we have the courage to talk to clients around the importance of investing in our people, which will help mitigate attrition on their accounts and the various other actions we're taking. So pricing is ultimately the factor that gives us an ability to maintain margin growth of 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year. Yes. Look, let's face it. I mean in every C-Suite conversation that I have as I go around the world, we all end up talking about multiple things around return to offers, hybrid work, culture and also about labor and supply chain disruption. And many clients over the years, as you know, have brought certain skills in-house and they're all dealing with the same trends we are dealing with ourselves in terms of elevated attrition and labor cost increases. So it is quite topical. It's quite known for our client base, and we're not the only company in the world approaching clients outside of standard renewal dates to intersect the classic rate card work. It's heavy lifting. It's not easy. I want to call out my team globally. We've worked very hard in the last 9 months to mitigate this to navigate our way through certain icebergs. And we know we've got some heavy lifting ahead of us as well. But the team are committed to do so. And we keep, obviously, everybody current on a quarter-by-quarter basis and see how much progress we can make in this regard. We just don't know. It's very hard to call, Keith. The reality is that attrition slows based on a series of financial measures we've made, serious promotion measures we've made. But obviously, there are elements of seasonality at play here as bonuses are paid, which triggered an increase in attrition in the last few months. And so therefore, I know that attrition will go up in Q2, and that's factored into our guidance. Once we get past Q2, we're just going to have to keep a close eye on this and see how we're able to continue to engage employees. I actually believe that the environment we're in these days, which I think we've hit a watershed moment of people no longer necessarily wanting to work in an office environment like in the past can be detrimental to employee engagement and cultural affinity and indeed can enable people to work more remotely. And then in countries like India, the notion of moving from a large urban center to a rural environment, trying to encourage people back to an urban environment can have meaningful consequences for their disposable income at the end of the month. So there's not just a philosophical debate in terms of whether you can commit your work on remotely leveraging technology, but it's very much a financial debate as well, notwithstanding the broader inflationary pressure in the urban centers or indeed in rural. So I'm somewhat of the opinion that we're at a new norm, the labor market as we set. And with that new approach to work, industry attrition may pick up on a more sustainable basis, particularly in today's demand environment, where I still feel that digital transformation is clearly throughout multiple industries, and there's a lot more legs on this in the years ahead. I'm very proud of our delivery organization. At the end of the day, Cognizant is a delivery company, whatever we sell a little more than a commitment to actually go and deliver against that. And come what may in the last few years, humanitarian crisis, a cyber attack and of course, in today's elevated industry attrition. Our delivery team have gone the extra mile time and time again to satisfy client demand and juggle various balls. So I'd like to complement them. We, of course, are complementing India as well by bolstering that with a global delivery network in Europe, in North America, onshore as well as nearshore locations. So they've done a really nice job for us. As we evolve the way we show up the clients and lead with advisory capabilities to sell solutions and deliver outcomes by industry, addressing client pain points, of course, there is an evolution that's happening in our delivery organization. And that includes how we solution and project and program management, and of course, the degree of efficiencies and accelerators we're able to use within our portfolio. And that's something we're making good progress on. And at some stage in the future, we'll talk more about that externally. But our delivery organization is the heart of Cognizant. I, frankly, was in India probably 4, 5 weeks ago, I'll be back there in the coming month or 2 as well. A lot of my team have been there in more recent weeks. I actually characterized the morale and the vibe amongst the delivery organization to be perhaps the highest it's been in the last 3 years. I really feel very good about where we are, notwithstanding the pressure everybody has been under given these either self-imposed or exogenous events. Yes. Look, I think fundamentally, given the revenue guidance Jan and I gave in November last year in the multiyear outlook as well as the current guidance for 2022, we've got to maintain a book-to-bill ratio at 1.1 or above. That's certainly directionally what's going to be needed for us to achieve those goals. I always think it's very important to underscore the importance of thinking about bookings across a trading 12-month basis. And to your point, Bryan, we've had some very strong years now the last 2. And from my perspective, we are in a much better position than that and we've been at any stage as I came here a few years ago. And I feel good about our win rate, and I feel good or better pipeline within that. So that's kind of my perspective in terms of bookings and our readiness to get after the market opportunity in the years ahead. The demand picture is less concerned than the attrition and labor cost concerns. Larger deals, trailing 12-month basis, we've got $23.4 billion of bookings without substantial large deals within that. And I view that as a positive because our digital momentum has really picked up. But certainly, with, I would say, strong delivery capabilities, strengthening project and program management, strengthening solution name, discipline within Cognizant. We are continuing to review the opportunity to get into some larger deals. And hopefully, we'll have some good news for you on that in the next few quarters. Some of those will be aligned to really us like FSI, where we've done some good work in portfolio. We cleaned -- refreshed our client-facing teams, both in delivery as well as in commercial, and we've got a very strong industry solutions group that needs to continue to get stronger. And we've been spending a lot of time with clients that we haven't sold to in recent years, and I think we have the opportunity to get into some of those larger accounts as well. So hopefully, you'll see something in the coming quarters in that regard. But our momentum has ultimately been carried by digital momentum, the reinvigoration of our commercial sales team and client centricity at our core, clearly, a broader portfolio that's more compelling than ever before, which has been intentionally built to exposures to higher growth categories. Our international expansion, I'll call out the UK, our second largest country after the U.S. growing consistently now. 20% plus is a really strong post-merger integration opportunity to scale into our accounts. If we can complement all of that with a few larger deals per year, that will be done opportunistically judiciously. There's a lot of potential left in this company, and I really feel good about that. Okay. With that, thank you very much for joining us today, and we look"

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued momentum within our digital portfolio. While overall uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased, we continue to see a healthy demand environment across our portfolio of services and offerings. Q1 revenue was $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 9.7% year-over-year or 10.9% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 220 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions partially offset by a negative 40 basis point impact from the sale of Samlink completed February 1. In Q1, Digital revenue grew 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 50% of total revenue. During the quarter, we reviewed the scope of our digital ensure alignment across digital skills, growth priorities and our pricing initiatives. This is the first time we have reviewed our definition since we updated it in 2020. Under the new definition, Q4 '21 digital revenue would have been about 49% of total revenue, approximately 4 points higher than the 45% we previously reported. For this quarter only, we are also providing some additional information to highlight the change in our digital definition. Under our previous definition, digital would have grown 18% in Q1, and represented approximately 47% of revenue. As Brian mentioned, Q1 bookings grew 4% year-over-year, which resulted in trailing 12 months bookings of $23.4 billion, representing a book-to-bill of approximately 1.2 unchanged from Q4. We believe this book-to-bill provides us a healthy opportunity to support our full year growth ambitions. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services revenue increased approximately 6%. Trends within this segment were consistent with last quarter as positive momentum within our North American banking business and improved performance in insurance were offset by softness in our global banking portfolio. Q1 growth also included a negative 130 basis point impact from the sale of our Samlink subsidiary. We remain focused on investing in our talent and digital capabilities aligned to our strategy. Healthcare revenue increased approximately 9%, primarily organic, driven by demand for digital services among pharmaceutical companies within our life sciences business, around digitization of clinical trial processes and modernization of manufacturing operations. Products and resources revenue increased approximately 15%, driven by double-digit growth across all subsectors within the segment. Segment growth also benefited from recently completed acquisitions, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to growth. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 20%, primarily organic reflecting growing demand for data services and our work with leading digital native clients, which has continued to support growth in our core portfolio. From a geographic perspective, in Q1, North America revenue grew 9% year-over-year. Growth continued to be led by life sciences, manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities and communications and technology clients. Our global growth markets, which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 17% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth was led by 20-plus percent growth in the UK, where we saw strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients, Products and Resources, and Communications, Media and Technology segments. We also continue to experience strong growth in Australia and Germany, driven in part by our recent acquisitions. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 15% as there were no non-GAAP charges in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, operating margin declined by approximately 20 basis points. The largest headwind remains increased compensation costs, including the cost of subcontractors. Partially offsetting these headwinds were delivery efficiencies, slowing growth of SG&A and depreciation of the rupee against the dollar. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 23.3%, and the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%, which benefited from discrete items, which we do not expect to repeat. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.07, and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.08. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion and net cash of $1.7 billion. Free cash flow in Q1 was $186 million, representing approximately 33% of net income. As a reminder, Q1 is seasonally our softest quarter for free cash flow, primarily due to the timing of bonus payments. DSO of 72 days increased by 3 days sequentially and by 2 days year-over-year. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares for $444 million on our share repurchase program and returned $143 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6.8% to 7.8% or 9.3% to 10.3% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 250 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year, we are increasing the organic growth outlook assumption in our guidance, reflecting strong performance in our digital portfolio and a healthy demand backdrop. However, we are tightening our constant currency outlook at both ends of the range, which reflects our improved organic revenue growth. This is partially offset by a lower expectation of inorganic growth, which we now expect to contribute approximately 100 basis points to full year growth versus 200 basis points previously. Our reported revenue outlook now assumes a negative 180 basis points impact from currency versus 70 points previously, which equates to roughly $200 million headwind in reported revenues. This leads to a revised reported revenue guidance range of $19.8 billion to $20.2 billion representing 4.2% to 9.2% growth or 10% to 11% in constant currency. This compares to our previous guidance of $20 billion to $20.5 billion, which represented growth of 7.8% to 10.8% or 8.5% to 11.5% in constant currency. Our capital allocation framework is unchanged. While we did not complete any acquisitions in Q1, we remain active in pursuit of acquisitions aligned with our strategy. We will stay disciplined as we analyze the acquisition pipeline, and thoughtful, as we assess the best use of capital. For the full year, we expect to return at least $600 million through share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. Our adjusted operating margin outlook is unchanged and we continue to expect approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion versus 2021. Our outlook for operating margin continues to assume industry supply side constraints and elevated attrition for the remainder of the year. Headwinds to operating margin include increased compensation costs, T&E and return to office costs, which we expect to offset through delivery efficiencies, digital revenue mix, pricing and SG&A leverage and discipline. We currently expect to see some gradual improvement in our operating margin in Q2. This leads to our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.45 to $4.55 compared to $4.46 to $4.60 previously, which primarily reflects the FX impact on our reported revenue outlook. Our full year outlook assumes interest income of $25 million and average share outstanding of approximately 522 million, both unchanged from our prior outlook. We also continue to expect a tax rate of 25% to 26%. Finally, we are still targeting full year cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income. However, there are several moving pieces that could cause us to fall below our goal. Key factors impacting our conversion rate include the timing of certain payments, cash taxes and higher CapEx. We remain focused on our working capital initiatives to offset these headwinds for the remainder of the year. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. It's a good comment. I'll start to tackle the M&A stuff first. I think we should expect a little bit of bumpiness in M&A just by the nature of it. And so it's fair to say we haven't really changed our capital allocation framework. So I think the general guideline that is on Brian's and my mind is still a 2% thing. I think in this case, we had a couple of deals that fell out of the pipeline for the reasons that Brian described. And as we outlook, we see a little bit more activity in the third and fourth quarter happening. So we just felt it was prudent to let you know about that. There's no change. It's just like these are discrete items and in 1 or 2 deals can make a little bit of a difference. But no change for the medium-term outlook. I think we're sticking with our 2% revenue growth and 50% of our free cash flow allocation to M&A. On the guidance, I think you got it right. We basically took the inorganic down by 100 bps, and we increased the organic constant currency at the same rate. So we are sticking with our same organic -- constant currency revenue, not organic, but all in constant currency revenue was sticking at the same midpoint. No, I appreciate that. You're familiar that our margin profile throughout the year has a typical curve with the second and third quarter being stronger, and we anticipate this year to have a typical curvature, so to speak, on margin. Clearly, you have seen an increased pressure on compensation costs. And so, we have built into our forecast, of course, offsetting measures relative to improvement in our cost to delivery efficiencies, investment into automation. We have -- of course, pricing is rolling out throughout the 4 quarters and will gain throughout the year. So all these things have to be coming together in order for us to achieve the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of margin expansion, which is our best outlook right now that we have. You broke up in the second question, the weakness in... Oh, BFS. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yes. So we don't really break out our subcontractor cost explicitly for you. But the biggest impact on our operating margin by far is really a merit in off-cycle and then pair that with the subcontractor hiring. So it's just a bigger factor as you would expect, higher attrition leads to some of that use. But I don't think we're breaking it out publicly, but those were the major factors on BFS continues to be on a good path. We see steady expansion. I mentioned in my call that Samlink went out of the revenue that put a little bit of pressure in the European banking and financial services revenue growth. But overall, we see a steady improvement that shows that we are on the right path here. There's actually increased digital bookings. There are core projects, as Brian mentioned in his call that are driving up. So as we -- I think Brian used on this call, the continued and steady improvement for BFS is kind of where we are. We're not at the end of our work here, but we're feeling we are on solid ground. Yes. We have clearly -- pricing is always part of our business model, and many of our clients obviously have regular price increases built into their contracts. But I think the extraordinary situation of wage inflation and cost pressure that also our clients' experience has, I think, opened more opportunities for us to drive pricing initiatives across the entire company. And I think we are deploying really a variety of approaches. Each client a little bit individualized to it. But once we're finding basically for many clients, receptivity. So it will be still hard. We are in the business of generating benefit and value for our clients. But the discussions from what I can see have been starting and have been constructive with our clients. So I'm expecting pricing to build momentum and help us to contribute to the margin expansion throughout the next 3 quarters. Hey, Rod, I'll take your second question first. TriZetto had actually -- interesting that you're asking -- the best product sales quarter ever in the history this quarter. So the product modernization that we had undergone with TriZetto continues to show benefit and so they are doing really well and the pull through implementation services and other services to it.  Relative to the M&A performance. We had -- our M&A portfolio is performing well against our budget, and we are generating actually revenue synergies as we had planned for. And I think we have probably a little bit more work to do to counter the margin dilution that our M&A does. But I'll give you 1 example. Our Softvision acquisition that we did now a number of years ago is now the core basis of our digital engineering business, and we're really integrating our entire engineering practice, digital engineering practice based on the Softvision model. So I would describe our M&A program is largely successful as a portfolio. Now you always have in a portfolio of companies, some that are not doing quite as well, but as a portfolio, we are very satisfied with the progress we're making on M&A. I'm sorry. I'm a little bit under the weather with a little bit of a cough. So sorry for that, Rod. Actually the rupee movement going forward, which is largely affecting basically, of course, our cost base is, as you know, moderated by our hedging program. So we really don't make an assumption around this. In the quarter, I think I mentioned in the script that the rupee did contribute about 50 basis points in a set of ups and downs to our margin. But that may help you a little bit to extrapolate for what it is. So this is largely driven by our revenue forecast that's going to be the euro and the pound are going to be the most impactful one in that. I think I don't want to go into all the details of the pricing opportunity, but you're pointing out, I think, a key element of -- that is playing a little bit in our favor. The shift towards digital is on its own helping because we have a higher gross margin in our digital business. We're focusing, obviously, also on the pricing of these high-end demand resources. And so that gives a little bit more pricing opportunities. Also these projects tend to be a little bit shorter term compared to other long-term contractual things. So in that area, we're going to expect to make some progress, and I think our clients have also shown more receptivity in the area of these set of digital skills to discuss pricing with us. So I think that's helping. So you have a double effect of driving higher share using our acquisitions and pricing levels that have been established by our acquisitions as a guide to establish better pricing levels for the entire enterprise. So I think you're intuitively pointing out 1 area that gives us -- is definitely part of our overall thinking relative to revenue generation. There's also an element, if I come back to the question is really the overall margin discussion and pricing has been a focus on this call. But we do have, with our shift towards hiring of Gen Zs dramatically shifted our cost pyramid development and the internal promotions not only help, of course, generating better group happening for our associates, but also help us to mitigate the cost of lateral hires. And we hope that as we execute on our strategy of increased Gen Z hiring that -- and we plan on cost efficiencies and in our delivery model, helping in a similar way to offset the compensation pressure that we're good seeing just on wages, basically."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover three topics. Cognizant's fourth quarter and full year results, an assessment of our progress in 2023, and a look ahead to our focus and outlook for 2024. I've been in the CEO role now for a full year and have used this 12 months to dig into the company's client relationships, operations, services portfolio, market environment, finances and culture. I've met with about 400 clients and established a regular cadence of listening to and speaking with our employees across the world. My full year immersion into everything, Cognizant has confirmed my belief in the high level of initiative and motivation of nearly 350,000 employees as well as my belief in the company's distinctive core strengths. I have confidence in our potential to increase our revenue growth, and I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes. Let's start with the fourth quarter where we delivered on our commitments while continuing to implement our cost management program. To call out three highlights. First, we executed well, delivering revenue within our guidance range despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures and meaningfully exceeded our adjusted operating margin expectations. Second, we made further progress on our goal to increase the percentage of large deals, new clients and business in the overall mix. And third, we saw continued improvement in our voluntary attrition. Q4 revenue of $4.8 billion was in line with the guidance range we provided last quarter. Year-over-year, Q4 revenue was down 1.7% as reported or down 2.4% in constant currency. The quarter developed much as we expected as clients remain cautious and limited the discretionary spending. Our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was meaningfully stronger than we anticipated, driven by savings from our next-gen cost management program and better execution on our operational efficiencies. We sustained our large deal momentum in the quarter, winning seven deals exceeding $100 million each. Of these seven deals, two were new business and five were a mix of renewals and expansions. I am especially pleased to see our continued decline in employee attrition, trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 13.8%, that is down 2.4 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points year-over-year. Turning to the full year. Revenue of $19.4 billion was down slightly from the prior year and in line with the guidance we set on our Q3 call. A strong Q4 margin performance enabled us to achieve a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% compared with a guidance of approximately 14.7%. We ended Q4 with a trailing 12 months booking growth of $26.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x. For 2023, about 30% of our TCV exceeded 50 billion plus deals, compared with approximately 20% in the previous year. We signed 17 deals that exceeded $100 million TCV, $100 million TCV. Total TCV for deals above $100 million increased 42% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to this progress. We have reoriented our teams to large deal demand generation and execution across all service lines. We have strengthened our ability to seed (ph), shape and sell large deals. And we have made progress in industrializing delivery with automation and productivity tools to create repeatable solutions and enable a consistent and efficient delivery operating model for large deals. Turning to our business segments where Jatin will cover our financial performance, I want to comment on our two largest segments. In financial services, while responding to a demand environment that remains challenging. We are increasing our efforts to stimulate growth. We've installed new leaders in a number of key positions across the segment. We have invested in consulting and commercial resources and targets of industries and in partner relationships. We are also focused on expanding our service offerings and on enhancing our industry solutions powered by new technologies like Generative AI. In Health Sciences, as the healthcare industry continues to undergo major transformation, we believe Cognizant is well positioned to become the nucleus of an emerging healthcare ecosystem through our platform's data and solutions. With these dynamics in mind, we are investing in the expansion of our TriZetto platform and our healthcare BPaaS solution capabilities. We are also capitalizing on the opportunity Gen AI presents to the healthcare market. For instance, LLM can be used to streamline payer administrative processes, automate clinical documentation and enhance clinical decision support systems. I remain confident in the value of our health sciences portfolio provides to clients. For example, Fortrea recently chose Cognizant as its technology transformation partner to deploy a modern secure digital ecosystem to help bring treatments to patients faster while strengthening its position in the life sciences industry. And Takeda, a global biopharma company with whom we have had a long relationship has selected us to help modernize their infrastructure and application management in support of the digital transformation. Now let's turn to an assessment of how we move the company forward in 2023. To begin, we made considerable progress enhancing three core strengths that taken together, I believe, Cognizant set apart in the market. First, industry expertise. In 2023, we further deepened our expertise at the intersection of technology and industry use cases to deliver industry specific solutions in service of business outcomes. We also enhanced our collaboration and co-creation with clients and the broader partner ecosystem to stitch together industry-leading capabilities. A good example is our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to advance the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. We are also collaborating with ServiceNow to enhance Cognizant's WorkNEXT modern workplace services solution with generative AI capabilities. WorkNEXT aims to provide more intuitive and personalized experiences for employees, while helping to better quantify and improve the return on experience for enterprise customers. A second core strength we are collaborative partners to our clients. As mentioned on our Q3 call, our annual client Net Promoter Score survey hit a historic high for Cognizant last year. Our empathy for clients as a part of our DNA and we believe we have become even better at listening carefully to, learning from, and working with clients to earn their trust, solve their problems and help them succeed. Third, we are passionate innovators. Last April, we launched Cognizant's Bluebolt grassroots innovation program calling on all our employees to help us solve client problems, look for unmet or latent client needs and challenge the status quo. And in just nine months, our employees generated more than 100,000 ideas, 21,000 of which we have already implemented. We expect to augment our Bluebolt program through a new collaboration with Microsoft to launch the innovation assistant as generative AI-powered tool built on Azure OpenAI service. Shortly after my arrival, we consolidated our performance objectives, the way we measure success. But just three long strategic priorities, long-term strategic priorities. Become the employer of choice in our industry, accelerate revenue growth and simplify our operations. I'll touch on our progress beginning with employer of choice. Our voluntary attrition improved throughout 2023 to multi-year lows, while our employee engagement scores improved to capitalize Cognizant's entrepreneurial spirit, we have given greater autonomy and accountability to business unit leaders. This is helping increase our responsiveness to client needs and market conditions. We remain committed to providing our teams with continuous learning, upskilling and professional development. In 2023, 90% of our global workforce spent time in learning with 270,000 of our employees acquiring at least one new skill proficiency. And 88,000 completing AI and generative AI courses. We've also established programs provide more opportunities for employees to advance their cadence. I'm pleased to say, we promoted nearly 30,000 people across the company last year. Later this month, we'll bring together our entire employee population and gatherings, physical and virtual to recognize excellence across the business with Cognizant's companywide awards program the IMPACT Awards. Late last year, we introduced an initiative called Shakti that will unify our women-centric programs to further advance carriers and boost women leadership in technology. Shakti will encompass Cognizant's leadership development programs for our senior level women globally and for our mid-level women in India along with our period upskilling program for women returning to work after a career break. Our second performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. We've invested heavily in platform-centric approaches to further differentiate Cognizant in select industries. I've talked about our core platform just TriZetto in healthcare, Shared Investigator in life sciences and asset performance in smart manufacturing to name a few. Last year, we also began industrializing solutions for the next wave of technologies with our AI portfolio. We introduced Cognizant Neuro IT Operations, our AI led platform built to reduce the complexity and costs of enterprise infrastructure. We launched Cognizant Skygrade our cloud orchestration platform designed to help clients to rapidly transition to modern cloud-native architectures. In addition, we introduced Cognizant Neuro AI, developed to speed clients' adoption of generative AI. With Neuro AI, we are able to quickly build AI enablement use cases for clients that are specific to their businesses. And just last week, we expanded our GenAI portfolio with the introduction of Cognizant Flowsource, developed to help engineering teams, deliver high-quality code faster with increased control and transparency. Today, we have over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some examples are creating a virtual coach for a diabetic patient for a pharma company, predicting the size of target audiences for a TV network, conducting sentiment analysis and summarization of user comments for a large bank, developing field services expert advisor for a manufacturer, enabling conversational intelligence for an insurance call center and auto generating a sales pitch for a tech company. We have another 350 plus opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. We aim to infuse AI, not only into our core offerings but into everything we do, including using generative AI to create industry and functional services. It's worth mentioning that one of our integrated practices, intuitive operations and automation which helps clients, build and plan modern operations across $2.5 billion of revenue in 2023. Our tech-driven modern BPO and automation services helps clients achieve higher levels of productivity and reap benefits of generative AI in the core processes. We strive to stay tuned to market shifts, which is why last month, we acquired Thirdera. And Elite ServiceNow Partner that specializes in solutions for the ServiceNow platform. Adding Thirdera brings an on and near-shore global presence to our own ServiceNow Business Group. With Thirdera, we'll continue to advance the efforts of our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to build a $1 billion combined business focused on AI driven automation. Our third performance objective is to simplify our business. We executed well on our NextGen program, which is aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning workspace to reflect the post pandemic work environment. Our cost management enabled us to achieve a 2023 adjusted operating margin performance that exceeded our expectations from early in the year. Simplifying our business goes beyond structurally reducing costs. It also helps us become more agile and productive and innovative. Last year, we further streamlined our operating model and what we -- what was a complex metrics structure to focus primarily on our markets and integrated service lines. We are moving towards fewer layers in the organization, which we believe will bring us closer to our clients and associates, help drive strong coordination across the company and further empower account teams to make decisions. In summary, 2023 was a year of strengthening our company's fundamentals. Now let's look at -- look to our focus in 2024. We have selected six strategic imperatives that will help further sharpen our differentiation across clients' primary needs, while strengthening our ability to achieve our performance objectives. These imperatives are to grow in select industries, expand internationally, with large deals capabilities, capture the AI opportunity, deliver our talent strategy, and implement our IT roadmap. In the interest of time, I'll focus on only one of those initiatives which is capturing the substantial AI opportunity. Although, consumer use of generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly. That said, we expect the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon and believe that after a slow takeoff movement of this curve will accelerate sharply. The results we have seen from initial GenAI proof-of-concepts are very encouraging. We believe system integrators like Cognizant will play a major role in managing, governing and optimizing generative AI initiatives upscale. This includes building accuracy in output, reducing hallucinations continued reenforced learning and testing incorporate -- incorporating transparency and accountability and iteratively driving performance optimization. Therefore on -- as mentioned on our prior calls, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years, spanning people, platforms, partnerships and M&A. We believe generative AI is becoming a driving force for the economy and society. In partnership with Oxford Economics, Cognizant developed and published a new economic impact study end of last month's World Economic Forum that predicts, generative AI could inject up to $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over 10 years. Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology. From 2023 to 2032 the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI could increase from 8% (ph) to 52%. Setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth. One last topic to cover and that's the demand environment. We see little change from the assessment we have provided in recent quarters about uncertain and weak discretionary spending in the early part of 2024. Given that clients are experiencing a period that has brought both change and uncertainty together, we expect them to continue to focus on reducing costs, consolidating vendors, modernizing the data and the processes and increasing the productivity, so that they can imply savings to AI led transformation. On a closing note, we celebrated our 30th anniversary just last month. We have stood the test of time and we are determined to sustain and extend the momentum we've created last year. As optimistic as I was about our company's future, when I joined last January, I'm doubly so now. Whatever the future may hold, I believe we are in a significantly strong position today than we were one year ago to seize the market opportunity ahead. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jatin, who joined us on December 4th for his initial observations about Cognizant and additional details on the quarter.\nJatin Dalal: Thank you, Ravi and good afternoon everyone. I am very excited to join Cognizant, and would like to thank the entire organization for such a warm welcome. I would also like to thank, Jan, for helping me in making the onboarding experience so seamless. I have always admired Cognizant's growth mindset, client centricity and the entrepreneurial culture. While it has only been two months since I joined, the energy and passion across the organization are apparent. I have also had the opportunity to participate in our global sales kickoff events in January. This has further strengthened my conviction in Cognizant's capability and our market opportunity. I'm excited to partner with Ravi and the entire leadership team, to build on the progress we have made in 2023, as we strive to reach our full growth potential. In doing so, I believe there is a tremendous opportunity, to create long term sustainable value for our associates, clients and shareholders. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year revenue results. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.7% year-over-year or a decline of 2.4% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 90 basis points of growth from our acquisitions. This led to full year revenue of $19.4 billion, which declined 0.4% year-over-year or 0.3% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Ravi discussed Financial Services and Health Services, which declined 6.6% and 2.7% year-over-year in constant currency, respectively. So I will quickly comment on our other two segments. Products and Resources revenue was roughly flat year-over-year in constant currency, which included contribution from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new business. This helped offset the macro-driven discretionary spending pressure. We saw relatively better performance in North America, particularly among auto, utility and travel and hospitality clients. Communication, media and technology revenue increased 2% in constant currency. The growth reflected the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new bookings. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 16.1%. Year-over-year, margin included savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. This helped partially offset increased compensation costs. As a reminder, the prior year period also included a negative impact from a noncash impairment charge, related to a Health Sciences customer. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26%, adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.4%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was 1.11, which is $1.11 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.18. Now, we turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $2.6 billion or net cash of $2 billion. DSO of 77 days was flat sequentially and increased three days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q4 was $659 million which brings full year 2023 free cash flow to $2 billion or approximately 95% of the net income. This was slightly ahead of our expectations. During the quarter, we repurchased over 4 million shares for $313 million and returned $146 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. For the full year, we returned about $1.7 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion through share repurchases and $591 million through our regular dividend. As of December 31, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.68 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.7% to 1.2% or a decline of 3% to 1.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of approximately 30 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $19 billion to $19.8 billion, which is a decline of 1.8% to growth of 2.2% year-over-year or a decline of 2% to growth of 2% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be up to 100 basis points, and we anticipate approximately 20 basis points positive impact for the year from the currency. Our NextGen program remained on track this quarter, and we still expect to incur total cost of approximately $300 million. This includes $229 million incurred in 2023, and our expectation for an additional $70 million in 2024. There are no changes to our savings assumption from NextGen, and we still intend to reinvest the majority of the savings in the growth opportunity in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted margins. We are pleased with the strong finish to 2023, which allowed us to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% versus our guidance of 14.7%. In 2024, we continue to expect 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion. This represents an adjusted operating margin range of 15.3% to 15.5%. We remain focused on driving further efficiency in our business model through improved utilization, increased operational discipline and automation of tools and processes. We are also introducing guidance for net interest income versus our prior practice of providing gross interest income. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $40 million. Our expectation for the full year adjusted tax rate is 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent about 80% of net income. This includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately $360 million because of a ruling on January 8 in India relating to a previously disclosed 2016 tax matter in connection with share repurchase transactions, undertaken by our Indian subsidiary. The ruling required Cognizant to deposit the funds with India tax authorities to proceed with our appeals process. The funds deposited with tax authority were previously held in bank deposit under lien. And as of December 31 were presented on our balance sheet under long term investments. The outflow will negatively impact our operating cash flow, but will not impact the cash and cash equivalent amounts on the balance sheet, and therefore, we do not anticipate any impact to our capital allocation priorities. Final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due toward tax authorities will be determined at the end of the appeals process. We continue to believe that we have complied with all tax regulations applicable to this matter in accordance with the law and intend to vigorously defend our position. Moving on to capital allocation. We expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders in 2024, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to pursue acquisition opportunities aligned with our strategy. For the full year, we therefore, expect to deploy more than 100% of free cash flow, given the negative impact of the free cash flow from the aforementioned additional deposit with the India tax authorities. Based on our anticipated share repurchases, our guidance for shares outstanding is approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.5 to $4.68. With that, we'll be open to take the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you. Hi, Ravi and hi, Jatin, welcome. My first question is with regards to bookings, if you can provide some color as it relates to ACV versus TCV expectations. New versus -- new versus renewals by sizing perhaps, I know you provided by count. And in terms of just cadence of when you expect new contracts to start kicking in and influencing growth, if you can comment on that, that'll be great.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Ashwin. Hope you're doing well. And I'm going to start -- this is Ravi here. I'm going to start and ask Jatin to chip in. If you look at how we shaped our 2023 bookings, we have significant upside on the category above $50 million, above $100 million and actually above $250 million TCV. Because these are large deals, managed services, cost takeout opportunities because 2023 was a lot of them, it also has a longer period if I may, in comparison to shorter deals in the range of say $0 million to $5 million versus $0 million to $10 million. The $0 million to $10 million deals actually they kind of get consumed in the same year as they form and it is actually in some ways driven by the discretionary spend. So we have more skewness. We don't comment on the ACV versus TCV. We don't publicly say that, but we have more skewness on large deals in comparison to the smaller deals. The large deals actually, we have significantly gone up over the previous years. Also, we have new renewals, new expansion, I mean renewals, new expansions and new logos in the mix I would say, we again have a significant upside on new and expansion, like we have commented on the numbers of deals. I think even in the TCV numbers, you will find new business and expansion being very, very high. In fact, we also made a point to make sure that we published some of these names in the market, for example, this quarter the important ones we published is Fortrea and if Fortrea is one of the customers we signed large deal with, we also published one on Takeda. So effectively what it does is, it gives you a good backlog for the future because the large deals have a longer period, so they are -- they give you a good backlog for the future. But they also have a runway into the current year where you win, but they have a bigger runway into the future years as you go forward. When we did 2023, we didn't have that luxury from 2022, because the large deal proportion was much lower. Now that we're entering 2024, what we won in 2023 will contribute to 2024, it did contribute to '23, but it will contribute more 2024 and it will create a backlog for the future. Now --\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Understood.\nRavi Kumar: The question is, what does it do to -- in our revenues. As much as it starts to contribute to revenues, it -- there is also a discretionary softness, which we had in 2023, which kind of -- a portion of it sits off. So the question is, in 2024, how much is the discretionary going to hold, depending on which you could see the impact. I mean, it's unknown at this point of time, early in the year, what is going to happen to discretionary in 2024. And discretionary in 2023 went down, and it kind of made up -- it kind of got neutralized by the extraordinary run we had on large deals. In 2024, we don't know what's going to happen to discretionary, but it will -- the '23 wins will contribute to it and the continued momentum in '24 will contribute to it as well.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: So as it relates to your outlook, what are you assuming beyond 1Q in terms of discretionary? And if discretionary does not actually come back to a good extent, would you still expect things like the investment in consulting relationships, partnerships and so on, to at least incrementally contribute or are we just in a waiting game?\nRavi Kumar: So Ashwin, if you do the math, you will notice that there is some sequential growth assumed in our numbers. So if you do the math, you will get that there is sequential growth assumed in our numbers. We have good traction on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, AI-led productivity deals, those are the large deals we are winning. So we want to double down on those opportunities. We think we have a winning formula, and we will continue to run on it, which will give us the new business and which will give us the expansion on our existing clients. So discretionary today is unknown. I mean -- and that's why if you notice our guidance range is broader because we do not know what we do not know. But our thesis is very simple. We are going to be prepared for a comeback of discretionary. We're going to be fully prepared for it. We will gear our operating engine. We'll gear our fulfillment engine, and we'll double down as it comes, so that we don't miss the opportunity. Equally, on a separate swim lane, we've got a winning formula on large deals for cost takeout, which will remain irrespective of discretionary comes back or not. So we're going to ride on them as well. We're going to continue on that momentum from 2023, which has contributed to new business and new logos. So we will go behind it. So we're going to be prepared on one swim lane, and we're going to double down on the other one. And if that comes back, we want to be seizing those opportunities.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Very helpful as always. All the best.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. The margin outlook was encouraging. So I was hoping for little more detail on the gross margin versus operating margin dynamic. It sounds like utilization rates should improve. You talk about NextGen benefits, productivity, pricing, that kind of thing. So I just want to make sure I understand the callouts for the -- for margins for the year across gross margin and operating margin, if that's okay. That's all I had. Thank you.\nJatin Dalal: Sure, Tien-Tsin. The -- I think the opportunity exists on both lines, and the drivers would be clearly different. The driver for gross margin would be really the efficiency of operations kicking in. We have quite a bit of utilization upside that one can capture as the growth return. The second is really deploying the tools and processes related -- around AI and automation to, to get some operational benefits out. So there's the opportunity on gross margin apart from the traditional opportunity around pyramid and Gen Zs and related traditional measures. On operating margin, definitely, there will be an upside on SG&A front led by some of the cost take-outs related with the tail end of NextGen program that will complete in 2024. So I would be -- I mean, we'll work on both, and we'll see where we go by the individual lines. But overall, we think we have sufficient actions around the overall expansion we have spoken about.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. And within\u2026\nRavi Kumar: Just to add to what Jatin said. We're very pleased with our performance on the NextGen program. We do think we have an opportunity for a full year impact this year on the NextGen program. Equally, as Jatin also pointed out, in addition to the classical levers in gross margin, we do have -- I mean, classical levers being, better operational efficiency, higher utilization, better pyramid, higher offshoring, I mean all of these are -- we are very encouraged with the progress. But we also have this unique opportunity to share the productivity benefits with our clients, which is the technology arbitrage versus the labor arbitrage, driven by generative AI tooling. And I think we are ahead of the curve, which is the reason why we are winning a lot of these large deals and sharing those benefits of productivity, which will then start to contribute to growth and operating margin as we go forward.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Great. That's what I was looking for. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.\nMoshe Katri: Hey, thanks for taking my question. And Jatin, welcome. It'll be great to work with you again. So a couple of questions. If we're looking at revenue growth, and we're looking at the deal flow that you've been winning since you came on board, Ravi. When do you think we could see that inflection point in revenue growth, especially as you start seeing some of these deals ramping on top of what you won last year and obviously, factoring the fact that it takes some time for these deals to ramp. That's my first question.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Moshe. Good to hear from you again. The wins in 2023 started to ramp in 2023, of course, they have a partial benefit in the first year and the start to get to more benefits in the second and the third year. Equally, the momentum as we got into the, into the back end of last year, we actually had more new business, more new logos in the percentage mix of our large deals, which means it'll have higher impact in the future years. So what this really does to us, it makes our business sticky, it increases our backlog for the future, and therefore you're entering the year with tail velocity. The only unknown in the mix is the $0 million to $5 million deals, which are discretionary in nature. And, they kind of neutralize if the fall-off, they kind of neutralize what you win on the large deals. I think part of that happened in 2023 because discretionary was pretty soft in 2023. 2024, we do not know what's going to happen to discretionary. Otherwise, I would say the flow of those deals, the large deals is continuing and it will strengthen in '24 and '25 when it will actually be fully realized. What it does though is -- I mean the unknown in the mix is, how much does that get neutralized by soft discretionary. If the discretionary is not soft, it comes back, we want to be prepared, it then starts to show the momentum. So it's interesting part because it's not about the large deals, it's also about the small deals, because if the small deals start to neutralize even if the plateau, then the large deals will start to show revenue momentum. That's how I see it. So we are executing to these deals pretty well. And this, Moshe, that in the first year, they always start with a transition, they start with a slower trajectory. And then once they take off, they get to a steady state of revenue. So that I'm not as worried about. I continue to believe that we are in good shape on that. What certainly I do not know is discretionary.\nMoshe Katri: Okay. That makes sense. And then the second one is more related to strategy. I've always been intrigued in terms of what Cognizant does with TriZetto. And that used to be a pretty big part of your healthcare practice, and I think you've indicated during our first introduction when you came on Board that you will be taking a second look at TriZetto and trying to kind of maybe revive the business. Are there any actions that you're doing there to, for us to see more of that reflected in the numbers and the healthcare vertical. Thanks a lot.\nRavi Kumar: Moshe, I have to say this, the healthcare ecosystem for Cognizant is the strongest in the market. It's an industry which will go through a significant transformation. So we are on a pole position in healthcare -- in the healthcare economy, all the way from payer, provider, pharma benefits management to Life Sciences. We have an extraordinary strength of platforms plus services. Just look at the order of magnitude of what we do on TriZetto. 250 million plus claims on an annual basis approximately, 100 million plus enrollments on an annual basis. We do 3 billion electronic data interchange transactions. So we have an extraordinary story of TriZetto, 60-plus percent of the U.S. insured population goes through our platforms. It's the fulcrum and the nucleus of healthcare ecosystem. So we're going to invest and double down on it, and seize the opportunities which come on this transformational journey for our clients. This is going to be a sector which will significantly transform and we have an exciting clientele base across the spectrum. We've invested on generative AI. We have done multiple announcements last year of embedding generative AI, including our partnership with Microsoft on the OpenAI piece, which we have embedded into the entire stack. So we are very excited about TriZetto. I am actually doubly sure that, that is going to be an integral part of our healthcare strategy for the future.\nMoshe Katri: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Just on the AI component and the potential acceleration that you may see as the year progresses. When you roll out these new products and services, is there a pricing conversation that you have with clients? Is there a way to price this differently? Can you command more? Or is it just that the expectation is you'll get a lot more in consulting services down the road? Can you maybe provide some color on that?\nRavi Kumar: Surinder, that's a great question. Thank you for that. I would say three swim lanes Surinder. The first is the last -- the last mile holding. The ability to take foundational models, which are available in the market and create a funnel to make them enterprise-grade which is the work you have to do on the last mile, all the way from managing, governing and orchestrating large language models or foundational models. And that's a variety of things. It starts from accuracy of the models to reducing hallucinations, to doing performance cost optimization, to reinforced learning unlike software. Generative AI goes through reinforced learning, even after you implement it because it learns through the process. So there is a lot of heavy lift needed to take the foundation models and make it production-grade, enterprise grade. And I think we have a unique opportunity, and I'm excited about what I have actually seen with the platforms we have built, the platforms we announced to the market, and how we are helping our clients to get there. We have 250-plus prototypes running, we have 350-plus in the pipeline. Whenever those CapEx cycles trigger off, I think we are in a good position to monetize on that. That's the first swim lane. So it's -- you could call it consulting in your language the way you put it, but it is actually a bunch of things we want to work on. There is a second swim lane, I would say, which is about how do you apply it to your productivity. And that kind of switches on to two things. How -- what does it do to developer productivity? What does it do to technology life cycles, all the way from design to testing to writing code to all of it. And I call them to subsegments because one is to cannibalize the business you do and share the benefits with your clients. The second is to go and cannibalize or rather go and propose something provocative on the work. We don't do as an incumbent, but we could actually create better productivity to our clients. And one of the reasons why we are winning those large deals is that's a pivot on our large deal story. We actually go and disrupt client landscapes with -- which is where we are not incumbent with not just labor arbitrage, but arbitrage powered by AI. So I would say there are opportunities all through, all the way from applying it to the landscapes to -- applying productivity to the technology life cycles, be it our business, we do or be it where we are not an incumbent. And I would say this is a pervasive opportunity. It will be a short -- it will be a slow takeoff, but it will be a short cycle of a slow takeoff, and it will then get into a sharp S-curve, as I mentioned on my preliminary comments. So it's a very pervasive technology. It diffuses very fast, and it has a very good distribution network. So I'm excited about the prospects, excited about the investments we're making, excited about how we're staying relevant with our clients. We've also embedded it into our platforms like TriZetto. So we are equipped to seize these opportunities as the CapEx cycles of generative AI trigger to enterprise grade work.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, just to kind of tease out what you're seeing in the discretionary spend environment. I guess the question I would ask is how much more can clients really pull back on that spectrum of spend? And then I guess the counterquestion here would be, given the relative economic resiliency, why aren't clients spending more at this point? Like what's holding them back? Like what do they need to see? Or what are they signaling to you of when they're willing to perhaps take some risk?\nRavi Kumar: So let me start and ask Jatin chip in. I would say, the discretion or the spend, if you take industry view is the motion banking, financial services and insurance. That's a sector which is burdened with high interest rates. And because of the high interest rate, there is a wait-and-watch and kind of a pause on discretionary work. Remember, these are financial services is one of the sectors which also has a strong technology retained organization. So what they outsource is dependent on how much is the discretionary. Let's see how the industry shape up in the year. And normally what I have seen based on the experience is, if there are one or two repeatable cycles of interest rate adjustments downwards, we will start to see the spend to come back. Discretionary is also tied to transformational work, that means transformational work, normally it takes off when there is a period of certainty. I've said this before in my remarks that we see this as a period of uncertainty and a period of change. I mean the change is -- the change ahead of us is, is such a positive catalyst. So if the uncertainty starts to go away. I think that change will trigger discretionary to come back. It's also a deal where, at the back end of the year, we -- in many parts of the world there are elections, so I don't know what impact does to discretionary. But, the AI cycle can trigger the discretionary back the industry rates drop can trigger the discretionary back, financial services is the biggest one. So we are hoping that the stability in that sector based on interest rate cuts can drive that discretionary back. So it's a little bit of -- I'm waiting for how the interest rate shape up for the -- in this year to really say whether it is going to come back or not.\nJatin Dalal: Yes. So Surinder my -- this is Jatin. I will just add to say that, there is this -- if you see the history of IT services industries and shocks and shock recoveries is always some event led. And as we all know, the current situation is not a shock, it's not an event, it is an overall high interest cost across the spectrum of the yield curve, which is weighing down on minds of decision-maker. It is difficult to call when the discretionary comes back, it's very sector-specific. And it is a little novel from what the world has seen in last 20 years, where there was one big event and then you actually saw interest rates go down very, very sharply, very quickly, and there was a bounce back of the demand. This time, it is a new slowdown that we are -- and I'm sure all our customers are coping to deal with that in terms of how they react to it.\nRavi Kumar: Also one other, one other, I would say, one other event in the mix is, during the COVID era there was a heavy discretionary in many sectors. And that's going to -- that went through -- that's kind of gone through a course correction, if I may, including the fact that there was uncertainty. So it's going to be an interesting year to watch on discretionary and that's probably as we go through the year, we'll probably get more visibility on it.\nSurinder Thind: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much and really appreciate all the color and detail you are giving today. I'm wondering, just in terms of the larger deals that you've talked about, can you talk about the scenario of win rates for Cognizant? Sounds like you're pretty confident, etc., but just wanted to get a sense for how you're perceiving your competitiveness right now in the market.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So you would have noticed that these large deals we are doing, we're doing based on a differentiated value proposition, and we are holding our pricing. I mean that's one of the reasons why our margins were good enough, good in 2023. And we gave 20 basis points to 40 basis points improvement this year. Our strength on our large deals is the following. We are able to unify the company together with the velocity, which is in line with what our clients are looking for. I mean, the velocity of these deals is very high, because these are cost takeout, vendor consolidation kind of deals. So you need that velocity, you need the unification of -- to come together, it's in our DNA, so I have kind of energized the DNA if I may in 2023, and that has helped us significantly. The second I would say is, there are sectors where we have strong capabilities. And in those sectors, we are a formidable force. We can be provocative in those sectors. We don't need to wait for a request for a consolidation or a request for productivity. We can actually work with our clients. We are very sticky. I mean we are also a company over the 30 years of Cognizant's heritage. We are very sticky to our client. So we could be provocative with bold ideas. I see that as a trade and an integral part of the DNA. And as a CEO of the company, I've been able to lead those provocative conversations with our clients. That has helped us significantly. We have an extraordinary front-end team, if I may. The third, I would say, is our execution muscle, which we built in the last one year, I'm very proud about it. And that has helped us to not just deliver these deals well, but also hold our margins as we execute these deals. The last one, I would say, in the mix is we also have, I would say, uniquely a differentiated value proposition related to productivity led by automation and AI, which can actually help to that provocative board thinking to support construction of these deals and share the benefits about the extraordinary opportunity AI provides to us. So I would say these are the three or four things which have helped us to win deals. And I would like to continue on that momentum in 2024.\nJames Faucette: That's great. And then wanted to ask is -- it's interesting in each of the last couple of quarters, you've increased net head count slightly. I think usually, that's taken as a positive indicator. Can you just talk about, as you're maintaining head count even in the face of potentially being down as much as 2% at the bottom end of your guided range this year, how you're thinking about managing that? And is the nature of the people you're adding and retaining just to serve kind of these larger deals that you've already booked? And how much of it is just in anticipation that more discretionary and smaller deals could come back? Just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about managing head count and what we should take from that?\nJatin Dalal: Yeah. So James, this is really a combination of both retaining sufficient flexibility for the growth to come. If the growth comes back, you should have sufficient flexibility on the bench. That's one. And two is really some plant addition that we do systematically to certain skill sets and certain part of our pyramid that has both contributed to this small addition that you are seeing on the total headcount.\nRavi Kumar: Also, just to add to what Jatin said, you should remember, we have an extraordinary story on how well we have done on attrition. I mean we are now really a top-notch player with industry-leading retention plan. I mean we have -- look at where we were at the start of quarter one in 2023 to now, our attrition has significantly improved. That is also helping us to be ready for the discretionary at any point in time it comes back, because it gives you the cast and capacity to fulfill.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you so much to both of you for your help.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions this evening. I wanted to ask you if you could comment on how much visibility or maybe relative visibility you have right now into fiscal '24? And I guess I mean relative to a more settled normal environment, and I guess the underlying question is, are you having to bake in more conservatism into your guidance this year to account for environmental, external factors that are difficult to kind of see through at this point?\nJatin Dalal: Sure, Ramsey. Ramsey, I mean, this is a typical beginning of the year where we don't know what we don't know. If you really see mathematically, if you dissect our guidance, you would see that there is a certain growth -- sequential growth that we have assumed during the course of the year. So there is a certain growth assumption that we are working in with. But environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly a slower start to the year, as Ravi indicated in his opening remarks.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up from me. Could you also give us your view on the extent to which clients are prepared to embrace generative AI? How much work still needs to be done on core sort of underlying technologies at this point for enterprises to start taking advantage of the new technology?\nRavi Kumar: I would say, in some areas, we are seeing more confidence. The two big areas I want to highlight is employee productivity and the second is customer service. We see them getting faster to production grade. Employee productivity is amplifying human potential, as we call it. Customer service always had uniquely opportunities here because remember, when robotic process automation, which is down the chain and the continuum of AI and generative AI, we also had the most reduction there. These are the two areas where they are ready. I think the things that grappling with is, as I mentioned, and the need of a system integrator like Cognizant plays an important role. The things they're grappling with is the accuracy of the models. They explain ability of the models, the traceability of the datasets. So that the explainability could be judged. I mean, remember this is, this is output, which is coming out from a computer which is building logic, which means you need to have explainability behind it to make it responsible enough. And I think the other thing that grappling with is -- I mean, we call that hallucinations but that's what it means in different ways. The other thing that they are grappling with this performance versus cost. So that they can make it production grade. But we will -- If it will disrupt, one of the studies we did with Oxford Economics is it will disrupt 90% of the jobs. Some jobs will get disrupted more, some jobs will get disrupted less. The tasks within jobs will get disrupted and we created something called an exposure of core on jobs which gives us the opportunity to figure out with jobs will actually go through more disruption. But at a high level I would say, these are the two broad areas where customers are probably going to be more prepared to cross the bridge on embracing generative AI into enterprises. Needless to say, this is going to be one of the most pervasive technologies in -- at times. So, I'm excited about the prospects but I'm equally, I'm equally getting prepared to what it means for a system integrator.\nRamsey El-Assal: Very interesting. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to management.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you all for your interest in Cognizant and for joining our call. We look forward to catching up next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",

            "name": "Jatin Dalal",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi and good afternoon everyone. I am very excited to join Cognizant, and would like to thank the entire organization for such a warm welcome. I would also like to thank, Jan, for helping me in making the onboarding experience so seamless. I have always admired Cognizant's growth mindset, client centricity and the entrepreneurial culture. While it has only been two months since I joined, the energy and passion across the organization are apparent. I have also had the opportunity to participate in our global sales kickoff events in January. This has further strengthened my conviction in Cognizant's capability and our market opportunity. I'm excited to partner with Ravi and the entire leadership team, to build on the progress we have made in 2023, as we strive to reach our full growth potential. In doing so, I believe there is a tremendous opportunity, to create long term sustainable value for our associates, clients and shareholders. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter and full year revenue results. Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.7% year-over-year or a decline of 2.4% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 90 basis points of growth from our acquisitions. This led to full year revenue of $19.4 billion, which declined 0.4% year-over-year or 0.3% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of growth from acquisitions. Ravi discussed Financial Services and Health Services, which declined 6.6% and 2.7% year-over-year in constant currency, respectively. So I will quickly comment on our other two segments. Products and Resources revenue was roughly flat year-over-year in constant currency, which included contribution from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new business. This helped offset the macro-driven discretionary spending pressure. We saw relatively better performance in North America, particularly among auto, utility and travel and hospitality clients. Communication, media and technology revenue increased 2% in constant currency. The growth reflected the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new bookings. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $40 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 90 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 16.1%. Year-over-year, margin included savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. This helped partially offset increased compensation costs. As a reminder, the prior year period also included a negative impact from a noncash impairment charge, related to a Health Sciences customer. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26%, adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.4%. Q4 diluted GAAP EPS was 1.11, which is $1.11 and Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.18. Now, we turn to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $2.6 billion or net cash of $2 billion. DSO of 77 days was flat sequentially and increased three days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q4 was $659 million which brings full year 2023 free cash flow to $2 billion or approximately 95% of the net income. This was slightly ahead of our expectations. During the quarter, we repurchased over 4 million shares for $313 million and returned $146 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. For the full year, we returned about $1.7 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion through share repurchases and $591 million through our regular dividend. As of December 31, we had $1.8 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.68 billion to $4.76 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.7% to 1.2% or a decline of 3% to 1.5% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of approximately 30 basis points. For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $19 billion to $19.8 billion, which is a decline of 1.8% to growth of 2.2% year-over-year or a decline of 2% to growth of 2% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be up to 100 basis points, and we anticipate approximately 20 basis points positive impact for the year from the currency. Our NextGen program remained on track this quarter, and we still expect to incur total cost of approximately $300 million. This includes $229 million incurred in 2023, and our expectation for an additional $70 million in 2024. There are no changes to our savings assumption from NextGen, and we still intend to reinvest the majority of the savings in the growth opportunity in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted margins. We are pleased with the strong finish to 2023, which allowed us to deliver a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% versus our guidance of 14.7%. In 2024, we continue to expect 20 to 40 basis points of operating margin expansion. This represents an adjusted operating margin range of 15.3% to 15.5%. We remain focused on driving further efficiency in our business model through improved utilization, increased operational discipline and automation of tools and processes. We are also introducing guidance for net interest income versus our prior practice of providing gross interest income. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $40 million. Our expectation for the full year adjusted tax rate is 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect free cash flow will represent about 80% of net income. This includes an anticipated negative impact of approximately $360 million because of a ruling on January 8 in India relating to a previously disclosed 2016 tax matter in connection with share repurchase transactions, undertaken by our Indian subsidiary. The ruling required Cognizant to deposit the funds with India tax authorities to proceed with our appeals process. The funds deposited with tax authority were previously held in bank deposit under lien. And as of December 31 were presented on our balance sheet under long term investments. The outflow will negatively impact our operating cash flow, but will not impact the cash and cash equivalent amounts on the balance sheet, and therefore, we do not anticipate any impact to our capital allocation priorities. Final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due toward tax authorities will be determined at the end of the appeals process. We continue to believe that we have complied with all tax regulations applicable to this matter in accordance with the law and intend to vigorously defend our position. Moving on to capital allocation. We expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders in 2024, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to pursue acquisition opportunities aligned with our strategy. For the full year, we therefore, expect to deploy more than 100% of free cash flow, given the negative impact of the free cash flow from the aforementioned additional deposit with the India tax authorities. Based on our anticipated share repurchases, our guidance for shares outstanding is approximately $497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.5 to $4.68. With that, we'll be open to take the questions. Sure, Tien-Tsin. The -- I think the opportunity exists on both lines, and the drivers would be clearly different. The driver for gross margin would be really the efficiency of operations kicking in. We have quite a bit of utilization upside that one can capture as the growth return. The second is really deploying the tools and processes related -- around AI and automation to, to get some operational benefits out. So there's the opportunity on gross margin apart from the traditional opportunity around pyramid and Gen Zs and related traditional measures. On operating margin, definitely, there will be an upside on SG&A front led by some of the cost take-outs related with the tail end of NextGen program that will complete in 2024. So I would be -- I mean, we'll work on both, and we'll see where we go by the individual lines. But overall, we think we have sufficient actions around the overall expansion we have spoken about. Yes. So Surinder my -- this is Jatin. I will just add to say that, there is this -- if you see the history of IT services industries and shocks and shock recoveries is always some event led. And as we all know, the current situation is not a shock, it's not an event, it is an overall high interest cost across the spectrum of the yield curve, which is weighing down on minds of decision-maker. It is difficult to call when the discretionary comes back, it's very sector-specific. And it is a little novel from what the world has seen in last 20 years, where there was one big event and then you actually saw interest rates go down very, very sharply, very quickly, and there was a bounce back of the demand. This time, it is a new slowdown that we are -- and I'm sure all our customers are coping to deal with that in terms of how they react to it. Yeah. So James, this is really a combination of both retaining sufficient flexibility for the growth to come. If the growth comes back, you should have sufficient flexibility on the bench. That's one. And two is really some plant addition that we do systematically to certain skill sets and certain part of our pyramid that has both contributed to this small addition that you are seeing on the total headcount. Sure, Ramsey. Ramsey, I mean, this is a typical beginning of the year where we don't know what we don't know. If you really see mathematically, if you dissect our guidance, you would see that there is a certain growth -- sequential growth that we have assumed during the course of the year. So there is a certain growth assumption that we are working in with. But environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly a slower start to the year, as Ravi indicated in his opening remarks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover three topics. Cognizant's fourth quarter and full year results, an assessment of our progress in 2023, and a look ahead to our focus and outlook for 2024. I've been in the CEO role now for a full year and have used this 12 months to dig into the company's client relationships, operations, services portfolio, market environment, finances and culture. I've met with about 400 clients and established a regular cadence of listening to and speaking with our employees across the world. My full year immersion into everything, Cognizant has confirmed my belief in the high level of initiative and motivation of nearly 350,000 employees as well as my belief in the company's distinctive core strengths. I have confidence in our potential to increase our revenue growth, and I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes. Let's start with the fourth quarter where we delivered on our commitments while continuing to implement our cost management program. To call out three highlights. First, we executed well, delivering revenue within our guidance range despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures and meaningfully exceeded our adjusted operating margin expectations. Second, we made further progress on our goal to increase the percentage of large deals, new clients and business in the overall mix. And third, we saw continued improvement in our voluntary attrition. Q4 revenue of $4.8 billion was in line with the guidance range we provided last quarter. Year-over-year, Q4 revenue was down 1.7% as reported or down 2.4% in constant currency. The quarter developed much as we expected as clients remain cautious and limited the discretionary spending. Our Q4 adjusted operating margin of 16.1% was meaningfully stronger than we anticipated, driven by savings from our next-gen cost management program and better execution on our operational efficiencies. We sustained our large deal momentum in the quarter, winning seven deals exceeding $100 million each. Of these seven deals, two were new business and five were a mix of renewals and expansions. I am especially pleased to see our continued decline in employee attrition, trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 13.8%, that is down 2.4 percentage points sequentially and down 12 points year-over-year. Turning to the full year. Revenue of $19.4 billion was down slightly from the prior year and in line with the guidance we set on our Q3 call. A strong Q4 margin performance enabled us to achieve a full year adjusted operating margin of 15.1% compared with a guidance of approximately 14.7%. We ended Q4 with a trailing 12 months booking growth of $26.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.4x. For 2023, about 30% of our TCV exceeded 50 billion plus deals, compared with approximately 20% in the previous year. We signed 17 deals that exceeded $100 million TCV, $100 million TCV. Total TCV for deals above $100 million increased 42% year-over-year. Several factors contributed to this progress. We have reoriented our teams to large deal demand generation and execution across all service lines. We have strengthened our ability to seed (ph), shape and sell large deals. And we have made progress in industrializing delivery with automation and productivity tools to create repeatable solutions and enable a consistent and efficient delivery operating model for large deals. Turning to our business segments where Jatin will cover our financial performance, I want to comment on our two largest segments. In financial services, while responding to a demand environment that remains challenging. We are increasing our efforts to stimulate growth. We've installed new leaders in a number of key positions across the segment. We have invested in consulting and commercial resources and targets of industries and in partner relationships. We are also focused on expanding our service offerings and on enhancing our industry solutions powered by new technologies like Generative AI. In Health Sciences, as the healthcare industry continues to undergo major transformation, we believe Cognizant is well positioned to become the nucleus of an emerging healthcare ecosystem through our platform's data and solutions. With these dynamics in mind, we are investing in the expansion of our TriZetto platform and our healthcare BPaaS solution capabilities. We are also capitalizing on the opportunity Gen AI presents to the healthcare market. For instance, LLM can be used to streamline payer administrative processes, automate clinical documentation and enhance clinical decision support systems. I remain confident in the value of our health sciences portfolio provides to clients. For example, Fortrea recently chose Cognizant as its technology transformation partner to deploy a modern secure digital ecosystem to help bring treatments to patients faster while strengthening its position in the life sciences industry. And Takeda, a global biopharma company with whom we have had a long relationship has selected us to help modernize their infrastructure and application management in support of the digital transformation. Now let's turn to an assessment of how we move the company forward in 2023. To begin, we made considerable progress enhancing three core strengths that taken together, I believe, Cognizant set apart in the market. First, industry expertise. In 2023, we further deepened our expertise at the intersection of technology and industry use cases to deliver industry specific solutions in service of business outcomes. We also enhanced our collaboration and co-creation with clients and the broader partner ecosystem to stitch together industry-leading capabilities. A good example is our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to advance the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. We are also collaborating with ServiceNow to enhance Cognizant's WorkNEXT modern workplace services solution with generative AI capabilities. WorkNEXT aims to provide more intuitive and personalized experiences for employees, while helping to better quantify and improve the return on experience for enterprise customers. A second core strength we are collaborative partners to our clients. As mentioned on our Q3 call, our annual client Net Promoter Score survey hit a historic high for Cognizant last year. Our empathy for clients as a part of our DNA and we believe we have become even better at listening carefully to, learning from, and working with clients to earn their trust, solve their problems and help them succeed. Third, we are passionate innovators. Last April, we launched Cognizant's Bluebolt grassroots innovation program calling on all our employees to help us solve client problems, look for unmet or latent client needs and challenge the status quo. And in just nine months, our employees generated more than 100,000 ideas, 21,000 of which we have already implemented. We expect to augment our Bluebolt program through a new collaboration with Microsoft to launch the innovation assistant as generative AI-powered tool built on Azure OpenAI service. Shortly after my arrival, we consolidated our performance objectives, the way we measure success. But just three long strategic priorities, long-term strategic priorities. Become the employer of choice in our industry, accelerate revenue growth and simplify our operations. I'll touch on our progress beginning with employer of choice. Our voluntary attrition improved throughout 2023 to multi-year lows, while our employee engagement scores improved to capitalize Cognizant's entrepreneurial spirit, we have given greater autonomy and accountability to business unit leaders. This is helping increase our responsiveness to client needs and market conditions. We remain committed to providing our teams with continuous learning, upskilling and professional development. In 2023, 90% of our global workforce spent time in learning with 270,000 of our employees acquiring at least one new skill proficiency. And 88,000 completing AI and generative AI courses. We've also established programs provide more opportunities for employees to advance their cadence. I'm pleased to say, we promoted nearly 30,000 people across the company last year. Later this month, we'll bring together our entire employee population and gatherings, physical and virtual to recognize excellence across the business with Cognizant's companywide awards program the IMPACT Awards. Late last year, we introduced an initiative called Shakti that will unify our women-centric programs to further advance carriers and boost women leadership in technology. Shakti will encompass Cognizant's leadership development programs for our senior level women globally and for our mid-level women in India along with our period upskilling program for women returning to work after a career break. Our second performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. We've invested heavily in platform-centric approaches to further differentiate Cognizant in select industries. I've talked about our core platform just TriZetto in healthcare, Shared Investigator in life sciences and asset performance in smart manufacturing to name a few. Last year, we also began industrializing solutions for the next wave of technologies with our AI portfolio. We introduced Cognizant Neuro IT Operations, our AI led platform built to reduce the complexity and costs of enterprise infrastructure. We launched Cognizant Skygrade our cloud orchestration platform designed to help clients to rapidly transition to modern cloud-native architectures. In addition, we introduced Cognizant Neuro AI, developed to speed clients' adoption of generative AI. With Neuro AI, we are able to quickly build AI enablement use cases for clients that are specific to their businesses. And just last week, we expanded our GenAI portfolio with the introduction of Cognizant Flowsource, developed to help engineering teams, deliver high-quality code faster with increased control and transparency. Today, we have over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some examples are creating a virtual coach for a diabetic patient for a pharma company, predicting the size of target audiences for a TV network, conducting sentiment analysis and summarization of user comments for a large bank, developing field services expert advisor for a manufacturer, enabling conversational intelligence for an insurance call center and auto generating a sales pitch for a tech company. We have another 350 plus opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. We aim to infuse AI, not only into our core offerings but into everything we do, including using generative AI to create industry and functional services. It's worth mentioning that one of our integrated practices, intuitive operations and automation which helps clients, build and plan modern operations across $2.5 billion of revenue in 2023. Our tech-driven modern BPO and automation services helps clients achieve higher levels of productivity and reap benefits of generative AI in the core processes. We strive to stay tuned to market shifts, which is why last month, we acquired Thirdera. And Elite ServiceNow Partner that specializes in solutions for the ServiceNow platform. Adding Thirdera brings an on and near-shore global presence to our own ServiceNow Business Group. With Thirdera, we'll continue to advance the efforts of our strategic partnership with ServiceNow to build a $1 billion combined business focused on AI driven automation. Our third performance objective is to simplify our business. We executed well on our NextGen program, which is aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning workspace to reflect the post pandemic work environment. Our cost management enabled us to achieve a 2023 adjusted operating margin performance that exceeded our expectations from early in the year. Simplifying our business goes beyond structurally reducing costs. It also helps us become more agile and productive and innovative. Last year, we further streamlined our operating model and what we -- what was a complex metrics structure to focus primarily on our markets and integrated service lines. We are moving towards fewer layers in the organization, which we believe will bring us closer to our clients and associates, help drive strong coordination across the company and further empower account teams to make decisions. In summary, 2023 was a year of strengthening our company's fundamentals. Now let's look at -- look to our focus in 2024. We have selected six strategic imperatives that will help further sharpen our differentiation across clients' primary needs, while strengthening our ability to achieve our performance objectives. These imperatives are to grow in select industries, expand internationally, with large deals capabilities, capture the AI opportunity, deliver our talent strategy, and implement our IT roadmap. In the interest of time, I'll focus on only one of those initiatives which is capturing the substantial AI opportunity. Although, consumer use of generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly. That said, we expect the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon and believe that after a slow takeoff movement of this curve will accelerate sharply. The results we have seen from initial GenAI proof-of-concepts are very encouraging. We believe system integrators like Cognizant will play a major role in managing, governing and optimizing generative AI initiatives upscale. This includes building accuracy in output, reducing hallucinations continued reenforced learning and testing incorporate -- incorporating transparency and accountability and iteratively driving performance optimization. Therefore on -- as mentioned on our prior calls, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years, spanning people, platforms, partnerships and M&A. We believe generative AI is becoming a driving force for the economy and society. In partnership with Oxford Economics, Cognizant developed and published a new economic impact study end of last month's World Economic Forum that predicts, generative AI could inject up to $1 trillion into the U.S. economy over 10 years. Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology. From 2023 to 2032 the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI could increase from 8% (ph) to 52%. Setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth. One last topic to cover and that's the demand environment. We see little change from the assessment we have provided in recent quarters about uncertain and weak discretionary spending in the early part of 2024. Given that clients are experiencing a period that has brought both change and uncertainty together, we expect them to continue to focus on reducing costs, consolidating vendors, modernizing the data and the processes and increasing the productivity, so that they can imply savings to AI led transformation. On a closing note, we celebrated our 30th anniversary just last month. We have stood the test of time and we are determined to sustain and extend the momentum we've created last year. As optimistic as I was about our company's future, when I joined last January, I'm doubly so now. Whatever the future may hold, I believe we are in a significantly strong position today than we were one year ago to seize the market opportunity ahead. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jatin, who joined us on December 4th for his initial observations about Cognizant and additional details on the quarter. Thank you, Ashwin. Hope you're doing well. And I'm going to start -- this is Ravi here. I'm going to start and ask Jatin to chip in. If you look at how we shaped our 2023 bookings, we have significant upside on the category above $50 million, above $100 million and actually above $250 million TCV. Because these are large deals, managed services, cost takeout opportunities because 2023 was a lot of them, it also has a longer period if I may, in comparison to shorter deals in the range of say $0 million to $5 million versus $0 million to $10 million. The $0 million to $10 million deals actually they kind of get consumed in the same year as they form and it is actually in some ways driven by the discretionary spend. So we have more skewness. We don't comment on the ACV versus TCV. We don't publicly say that, but we have more skewness on large deals in comparison to the smaller deals. The large deals actually, we have significantly gone up over the previous years. Also, we have new renewals, new expansion, I mean renewals, new expansions and new logos in the mix I would say, we again have a significant upside on new and expansion, like we have commented on the numbers of deals. I think even in the TCV numbers, you will find new business and expansion being very, very high. In fact, we also made a point to make sure that we published some of these names in the market, for example, this quarter the important ones we published is Fortrea and if Fortrea is one of the customers we signed large deal with, we also published one on Takeda. So effectively what it does is, it gives you a good backlog for the future because the large deals have a longer period, so they are -- they give you a good backlog for the future. But they also have a runway into the current year where you win, but they have a bigger runway into the future years as you go forward. When we did 2023, we didn't have that luxury from 2022, because the large deal proportion was much lower. Now that we're entering 2024, what we won in 2023 will contribute to 2024, it did contribute to '23, but it will contribute more 2024 and it will create a backlog for the future. Now -- The question is, what does it do to -- in our revenues. As much as it starts to contribute to revenues, it -- there is also a discretionary softness, which we had in 2023, which kind of -- a portion of it sits off. So the question is, in 2024, how much is the discretionary going to hold, depending on which you could see the impact. I mean, it's unknown at this point of time, early in the year, what is going to happen to discretionary in 2024. And discretionary in 2023 went down, and it kind of made up -- it kind of got neutralized by the extraordinary run we had on large deals. In 2024, we don't know what's going to happen to discretionary, but it will -- the '23 wins will contribute to it and the continued momentum in '24 will contribute to it as well. So Ashwin, if you do the math, you will notice that there is some sequential growth assumed in our numbers. So if you do the math, you will get that there is sequential growth assumed in our numbers. We have good traction on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, AI-led productivity deals, those are the large deals we are winning. So we want to double down on those opportunities. We think we have a winning formula, and we will continue to run on it, which will give us the new business and which will give us the expansion on our existing clients. So discretionary today is unknown. I mean -- and that's why if you notice our guidance range is broader because we do not know what we do not know. But our thesis is very simple. We are going to be prepared for a comeback of discretionary. We're going to be fully prepared for it. We will gear our operating engine. We'll gear our fulfillment engine, and we'll double down as it comes, so that we don't miss the opportunity. Equally, on a separate swim lane, we've got a winning formula on large deals for cost takeout, which will remain irrespective of discretionary comes back or not. So we're going to ride on them as well. We're going to continue on that momentum from 2023, which has contributed to new business and new logos. So we will go behind it. So we're going to be prepared on one swim lane, and we're going to double down on the other one. And if that comes back, we want to be seizing those opportunities. Just to add to what Jatin said. We're very pleased with our performance on the NextGen program. We do think we have an opportunity for a full year impact this year on the NextGen program. Equally, as Jatin also pointed out, in addition to the classical levers in gross margin, we do have -- I mean, classical levers being, better operational efficiency, higher utilization, better pyramid, higher offshoring, I mean all of these are -- we are very encouraged with the progress. But we also have this unique opportunity to share the productivity benefits with our clients, which is the technology arbitrage versus the labor arbitrage, driven by generative AI tooling. And I think we are ahead of the curve, which is the reason why we are winning a lot of these large deals and sharing those benefits of productivity, which will then start to contribute to growth and operating margin as we go forward. Thank you, Moshe. Good to hear from you again. The wins in 2023 started to ramp in 2023, of course, they have a partial benefit in the first year and the start to get to more benefits in the second and the third year. Equally, the momentum as we got into the, into the back end of last year, we actually had more new business, more new logos in the percentage mix of our large deals, which means it'll have higher impact in the future years. So what this really does to us, it makes our business sticky, it increases our backlog for the future, and therefore you're entering the year with tail velocity. The only unknown in the mix is the $0 million to $5 million deals, which are discretionary in nature. And, they kind of neutralize if the fall-off, they kind of neutralize what you win on the large deals. I think part of that happened in 2023 because discretionary was pretty soft in 2023. 2024, we do not know what's going to happen to discretionary. Otherwise, I would say the flow of those deals, the large deals is continuing and it will strengthen in '24 and '25 when it will actually be fully realized. What it does though is -- I mean the unknown in the mix is, how much does that get neutralized by soft discretionary. If the discretionary is not soft, it comes back, we want to be prepared, it then starts to show the momentum. So it's interesting part because it's not about the large deals, it's also about the small deals, because if the small deals start to neutralize even if the plateau, then the large deals will start to show revenue momentum. That's how I see it. So we are executing to these deals pretty well. And this, Moshe, that in the first year, they always start with a transition, they start with a slower trajectory. And then once they take off, they get to a steady state of revenue. So that I'm not as worried about. I continue to believe that we are in good shape on that. What certainly I do not know is discretionary. Moshe, I have to say this, the healthcare ecosystem for Cognizant is the strongest in the market. It's an industry which will go through a significant transformation. So we are on a pole position in healthcare -- in the healthcare economy, all the way from payer, provider, pharma benefits management to Life Sciences. We have an extraordinary strength of platforms plus services. Just look at the order of magnitude of what we do on TriZetto. 250 million plus claims on an annual basis approximately, 100 million plus enrollments on an annual basis. We do 3 billion electronic data interchange transactions. So we have an extraordinary story of TriZetto, 60-plus percent of the U.S. insured population goes through our platforms. It's the fulcrum and the nucleus of healthcare ecosystem. So we're going to invest and double down on it, and seize the opportunities which come on this transformational journey for our clients. This is going to be a sector which will significantly transform and we have an exciting clientele base across the spectrum. We've invested on generative AI. We have done multiple announcements last year of embedding generative AI, including our partnership with Microsoft on the OpenAI piece, which we have embedded into the entire stack. So we are very excited about TriZetto. I am actually doubly sure that, that is going to be an integral part of our healthcare strategy for the future. Surinder, that's a great question. Thank you for that. I would say three swim lanes Surinder. The first is the last -- the last mile holding. The ability to take foundational models, which are available in the market and create a funnel to make them enterprise-grade which is the work you have to do on the last mile, all the way from managing, governing and orchestrating large language models or foundational models. And that's a variety of things. It starts from accuracy of the models to reducing hallucinations, to doing performance cost optimization, to reinforced learning unlike software. Generative AI goes through reinforced learning, even after you implement it because it learns through the process. So there is a lot of heavy lift needed to take the foundation models and make it production-grade, enterprise grade. And I think we have a unique opportunity, and I'm excited about what I have actually seen with the platforms we have built, the platforms we announced to the market, and how we are helping our clients to get there. We have 250-plus prototypes running, we have 350-plus in the pipeline. Whenever those CapEx cycles trigger off, I think we are in a good position to monetize on that. That's the first swim lane. So it's -- you could call it consulting in your language the way you put it, but it is actually a bunch of things we want to work on. There is a second swim lane, I would say, which is about how do you apply it to your productivity. And that kind of switches on to two things. How -- what does it do to developer productivity? What does it do to technology life cycles, all the way from design to testing to writing code to all of it. And I call them to subsegments because one is to cannibalize the business you do and share the benefits with your clients. The second is to go and cannibalize or rather go and propose something provocative on the work. We don't do as an incumbent, but we could actually create better productivity to our clients. And one of the reasons why we are winning those large deals is that's a pivot on our large deal story. We actually go and disrupt client landscapes with -- which is where we are not incumbent with not just labor arbitrage, but arbitrage powered by AI. So I would say there are opportunities all through, all the way from applying it to the landscapes to -- applying productivity to the technology life cycles, be it our business, we do or be it where we are not an incumbent. And I would say this is a pervasive opportunity. It will be a short -- it will be a slow takeoff, but it will be a short cycle of a slow takeoff, and it will then get into a sharp S-curve, as I mentioned on my preliminary comments. So it's a very pervasive technology. It diffuses very fast, and it has a very good distribution network. So I'm excited about the prospects, excited about the investments we're making, excited about how we're staying relevant with our clients. We've also embedded it into our platforms like TriZetto. So we are equipped to seize these opportunities as the CapEx cycles of generative AI trigger to enterprise grade work. So let me start and ask Jatin chip in. I would say, the discretion or the spend, if you take industry view is the motion banking, financial services and insurance. That's a sector which is burdened with high interest rates. And because of the high interest rate, there is a wait-and-watch and kind of a pause on discretionary work. Remember, these are financial services is one of the sectors which also has a strong technology retained organization. So what they outsource is dependent on how much is the discretionary. Let's see how the industry shape up in the year. And normally what I have seen based on the experience is, if there are one or two repeatable cycles of interest rate adjustments downwards, we will start to see the spend to come back. Discretionary is also tied to transformational work, that means transformational work, normally it takes off when there is a period of certainty. I've said this before in my remarks that we see this as a period of uncertainty and a period of change. I mean the change is -- the change ahead of us is, is such a positive catalyst. So if the uncertainty starts to go away. I think that change will trigger discretionary to come back. It's also a deal where, at the back end of the year, we -- in many parts of the world there are elections, so I don't know what impact does to discretionary. But, the AI cycle can trigger the discretionary back the industry rates drop can trigger the discretionary back, financial services is the biggest one. So we are hoping that the stability in that sector based on interest rate cuts can drive that discretionary back. So it's a little bit of -- I'm waiting for how the interest rate shape up for the -- in this year to really say whether it is going to come back or not. Also one other, one other, I would say, one other event in the mix is, during the COVID era there was a heavy discretionary in many sectors. And that's going to -- that went through -- that's kind of gone through a course correction, if I may, including the fact that there was uncertainty. So it's going to be an interesting year to watch on discretionary and that's probably as we go through the year, we'll probably get more visibility on it. Yes. So you would have noticed that these large deals we are doing, we're doing based on a differentiated value proposition, and we are holding our pricing. I mean that's one of the reasons why our margins were good enough, good in 2023. And we gave 20 basis points to 40 basis points improvement this year. Our strength on our large deals is the following. We are able to unify the company together with the velocity, which is in line with what our clients are looking for. I mean, the velocity of these deals is very high, because these are cost takeout, vendor consolidation kind of deals. So you need that velocity, you need the unification of -- to come together, it's in our DNA, so I have kind of energized the DNA if I may in 2023, and that has helped us significantly. The second I would say is, there are sectors where we have strong capabilities. And in those sectors, we are a formidable force. We can be provocative in those sectors. We don't need to wait for a request for a consolidation or a request for productivity. We can actually work with our clients. We are very sticky. I mean we are also a company over the 30 years of Cognizant's heritage. We are very sticky to our client. So we could be provocative with bold ideas. I see that as a trade and an integral part of the DNA. And as a CEO of the company, I've been able to lead those provocative conversations with our clients. That has helped us significantly. We have an extraordinary front-end team, if I may. The third, I would say, is our execution muscle, which we built in the last one year, I'm very proud about it. And that has helped us to not just deliver these deals well, but also hold our margins as we execute these deals. The last one, I would say, in the mix is we also have, I would say, uniquely a differentiated value proposition related to productivity led by automation and AI, which can actually help to that provocative board thinking to support construction of these deals and share the benefits about the extraordinary opportunity AI provides to us. So I would say these are the three or four things which have helped us to win deals. And I would like to continue on that momentum in 2024. Also, just to add to what Jatin said, you should remember, we have an extraordinary story on how well we have done on attrition. I mean we are now really a top-notch player with industry-leading retention plan. I mean we have -- look at where we were at the start of quarter one in 2023 to now, our attrition has significantly improved. That is also helping us to be ready for the discretionary at any point in time it comes back, because it gives you the cast and capacity to fulfill. Thank you, James. I would say, in some areas, we are seeing more confidence. The two big areas I want to highlight is employee productivity and the second is customer service. We see them getting faster to production grade. Employee productivity is amplifying human potential, as we call it. Customer service always had uniquely opportunities here because remember, when robotic process automation, which is down the chain and the continuum of AI and generative AI, we also had the most reduction there. These are the two areas where they are ready. I think the things that grappling with is, as I mentioned, and the need of a system integrator like Cognizant plays an important role. The things they're grappling with is the accuracy of the models. They explain ability of the models, the traceability of the datasets. So that the explainability could be judged. I mean, remember this is, this is output, which is coming out from a computer which is building logic, which means you need to have explainability behind it to make it responsible enough. And I think the other thing that grappling with is -- I mean, we call that hallucinations but that's what it means in different ways. The other thing that they are grappling with this performance versus cost. So that they can make it production grade. But we will -- If it will disrupt, one of the studies we did with Oxford Economics is it will disrupt 90% of the jobs. Some jobs will get disrupted more, some jobs will get disrupted less. The tasks within jobs will get disrupted and we created something called an exposure of core on jobs which gives us the opportunity to figure out with jobs will actually go through more disruption. But at a high level I would say, these are the two broad areas where customers are probably going to be more prepared to cross the bridge on embracing generative AI into enterprises. Needless to say, this is going to be one of the most pervasive technologies in -- at times. So, I'm excited about the prospects but I'm equally, I'm equally getting prepared to what it means for a system integrator."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's third quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, the demand environment and a brief update on our strategic priorities. We are pleased with the company's continued progress in the third quarter, during which clients remained cautious amid economic uncertainty and discretionary spend was under pressure. Q3 revenue came in at $4.9 billion, within our guidance range. We saw sequential revenue growth of 20 basis points year-over-year. Revenue grew 0.8% as reported or a modest decline of 20 basis points in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin of 15.5% exceeded our expectations, mostly reflecting savings from our next generation program which remains on track as well as from our operational discipline and the timing of spend on investment opportunities. We recorded another quarter of bookings growth, up approximately 9% year-over-year. We ended Q3 with a record trailing 12-month bookings growth of $26.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and a strong book-to-bill of 1.4x. We have sustained our large deal momentum through Q3. Approximately 30% of our in-quarter Q3 bookings were large deals and 3 of these deals exceeded $100 million each. I believe we are getting progressively better at building a creative deal generation engine and solutioning large deals. I am especially encouraged to see our continued decline in attrition. Trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 16.2%, down about 4 percentage points sequentially and down 13 points year-over-year. This decline in attrition was a positive factor in our just completed annual client Net Promoter Score survey which showed significant improvement year-over-year and hit a historic high for Cognizant. Clients let us know that leadership, account management and delivery are especially important to them. And the survey results show that in these areas, we're doing a great job. This assessment of how clients perceive Cognizant underscores the interdependence of the employee and client experience that gives us confidence that the changes we are making will help strengthen the portfolio over the long run. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. We continue to reposition our Financial Services segment, while responding to an increasingly challenged demand environment. One of the ways we are striving to reinvigorate growth is through a sharply focused subindustry go-to-market approach in the Americas directly by highly experienced leaders. We believe this change will increase our agility and deepen our domain expertise. Let's turn to the demand environment and what I'm hearing from clients. Clients remain focused on efficiency initiatives to reduce costs and consolidate providers as they increase their productivity and resilience and we are helping them do so. This should, in turn, enable them to underwrite their continuing investment in digital transformation. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our relationship with Lineage, a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics to help build an industry-leading operating platform and establish a plan to support their operations through automation and infrastructure management. We also established a new multiyear relationship with Swedish firm, Intrum. We expect to provide end-to-end digital integration and core modernization services for their credit management technology platform. To dive deeper into clients' long-term objectives and discover new ways to strengthen our partnership with them, Cognizant held a 2-day Discovery Summit last month for about 130 of our North America clients, our first large-scale client gathering in more than 4 years. We discussed the transformative power of generative AI and how we believe it can reshape every industry. We showed clients how to apply generative AI to create more connected, collaborative and responsive relationships with their customers. We also ran live use cases at Cognizant's new AI platform, showing generative AI working alongside legacy data and machine learning models to rapidly create end-to-end AI use cases to tackle client KPIs. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years, focusing on areas such as platform modernization infrastructure, recruiting and upskilling. To that end, we opened a dedicated AI innovation studio in London. And later this year, we expect to OpenAI studios in New York, Dallas and Bangalore. We have trained about 55,000 of our employees in generative AI this year and have an additional 40,000 employees from all levels of our company registered in pursuing training on Gen AI. We have also invested in AI partnerships and experimental infrastructure to support early client engagements. We believe clients will depend on partners like Cognizant to generate significant productivity gains through automated AI-powered platforms for design, engineering and operations. This shift in client behavior further validates a recently refined strategy which is aimed at strengthening Cognizant's differentiation to help drive growth. Our strategy is focused on 3 imperatives. First, we are resolved to be an industry-led, creating value for clients by integrating technology with industry use cases to drive business outcomes. We are embedding industry expertise across our value chain and select industries. We are developing more enterprise scale platforms designed for industry and operational use cases. Partnerships have a major role to play here. We are focused on expanding our partner ecosystem across a range of technology providers. Among them, hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise software companies, digital software enterprises and emerging start-ups. We believe this partner ecosystem will enable us to enhance our integrated offering by combining third-party products with our service solutions, helping to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation. We believe this strategy as a full stack provider opens new and significant managed services opportunities. Second, given today's more heterogeneous technology landscape and the desire of many clients to build their own technology muscle, we focus on operating a highly flexible business model to meet clients where they are in their digital transformation journeys. We can support them across a range of project types, whether that's structured deals, traditional managed services, build-operate-transfer, co-innovation, partner solutions or large technology transformations. And to help clients strengthen their technology expertise, we can either lend our human capital along with our human capital value chain which includes learning, development, automation and AI infrastructure and more. Our business model flexibility is well suited to the changing nature of large deals where we see increasing demand for bundling services, often a combination of software people takeover infrastructure and services. These deals have a potential to bring Cognizant into the heart of clients' business landscape, putting us in a strong position to capture future services opportunities. Our third imperative is to enable more intimate levels of client collaboration and co-innovation. This effort grows out of our heritage of client centricity and grassroots innovation. Given the scale and diversity of our global teams, we believe we have a potential to harvest an abundance of ideas, big and small, that can contribute to our clients' focus. Inspired by our BlueBolt's grassroots innovation movement launched in quarter 2, more than 35,000 of our employees have generated 75,000 ideas. We have already implemented about 14,000 of these ideas, nearly 6,000 of which are client-facing. A strengthened ability to co-innovate with clients is especially valuable as they grapple with understanding and applying generative AI. During the quarter, we launched Telco Assurance 360; a cloud-based AI-powered solution built on ServiceNow and designed to provide telcos with real-time visibility into network issues and fast proactive resolution through AI-powered analytics. We also signed a multiyear agreement with a leading provider of digital and cloud-enabled solutions that are vital to the administration of health and human services programs across the U.S. Cognizant will serve as the client's sole global IT services and operations partner to help drive transformation at scale. We also provide the client with access to our AI, machine learning and generated AI tools, along with our TriZetto platform to advance revenue growth, increase administrative efficiency and improve the member experience. What's more, we are expanding our strategic collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies to jointly implement the AI-based solutions at the edge as a part of our Car-to-Cloud initiative. We encourage our clients who want to transform their businesses by being AI first to begin the journey by modernizing the data architecture, cloud infrastructure and core business applications. Today, we are running more than 150-plus early client engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some of the examples of this work include general productivity use cases related to writing code, code analysis and troubleshooting, knowledge management and translating product specs into natural chat or speech, business specific use cases for call center automation product prototyping, audience prediction, claims management, medical scribing and research and development; and domain specific use cases like onboarding new employees, validating deep documents and financial statement planning analytics. We have 300-plus additional opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. Let's turn to a quick update on our 3 long-term strategic objectives, starting with becoming an employer of choice in our industry. I see Cognizant as a human capital company, first; and a technology company, second. Everything we do hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent base. That's why it is so consequential that our voluntary attrition continues to fall, putting us on par with the industry average. We expect further improvement in our attrition in quarter 4. It's also worth noting that in quarter 3, we had a net sequential head count increase for the first time in several quarters. As a human capital company, we are determined to help improve the lives of workers around the world. With that in mind, we announced a ground-breaking training initiative yesterday called Cognizant Synapse Initiative, a job training endeavor, is aimed at empowering more than 1 million individuals with the advanced technology skills, including generative AI and that, they will need to thrive in the digital economy. We intend to build a consortium of partners for training and jobs which will then employ individuals who have upskilled through our Synapse Initiative. Our next performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. When I joined Cognizant in January, I said large deals are one of my top priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see our continuing large deals momentum which is underpinned by the work we are doing to improve the capabilities required to seed, shape and sell large deals and our ongoing investment in the client-facing roles needed for driving growth. These efforts have helped to partially offset what remains a softer discretionary spending environment and provides new growth opportunities following last year's muted bookings growth. Our third performance objective is to ensure operational excellence across the company. We remain focused on simplifying our operations, including a sales and delivery structure so we can continue to become more agile and get closer to clients and their unique business challenges. In general, we are operating with fewer layers, optimizing our day-to-day operations with enhanced systems and tools and working to streamline our processes and automate information flows using AI. Differentiation in the tech services industry happens at the clients' side and the project level, making relationships and strong execution key. That's why I've invested so much time in meeting with over 270 clients so far this year, building trust and learning all I can about Cognizant can deliver more value to them. Over the past 3 quarters, I believe Cognizant has made meaningful progress on our long-term priorities. While we have a lot of work ahead, we also have much to be proud of. This includes continuing large deals momentum, improved employee and client satisfaction scores, declining attrition, the scaling of our industry leadership with a platform-centered approach, heightened operational discipline and the launch of a grassroots innovation movement. Looking ahead, we believe the soft demand environment is unlikely to see a rapid rebound. Therefore, we expect clients to continue tempering the discretionary spending as we begin the new year. Given that market reality, we remain focused on winning efficiency-led large deals aimed at cost takeout and vendor consolidation which can offset current pressure on discretionary spending. Our focus on operating discipline and our year-to-date progress on the NextGen program gives us confidence that we can meet our expectation to deliver our 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion next year. Jan will share more detail on NextGen in a moment. Taking a longer view with my read of business history, periods of great uncertainty and periods of change rarely coincide. Today, I believe we are in just such a period of simultaneous great uncertainty and deep-seated change. The uncertainty is being compounded by a number of intertwined domestic and international risks. What can become a transformative change is being driven primarily by new general-purpose technologies with immense power such as generative AI which I believe could become as ubiquitous and consequential for business as society as the Internet did 3 decades ago. I expect this reality will leave most clients. However, focused they are on navigating uncertainty with no choice but to make some big bets if they are not to be left behind by the peers. I believe Cognizant is in a position -- in a great position to prepare them for this future, whether by helping them achieve significant savings to underwrite investments in transformation or by helping them build their own technology muscle which can include becoming fully AI-ready. In closing, you are all aware that we recently appointed Jatin Dalal to be Cognizant's next Chief Financial Officer and we're excited that he will be joining us in December. Since this is Jan's last earnings call with Cognizant, I want you all to know that what a powerful partner he's been to me across so many dimensions: strategic, financial, operational and cultural. He left a positive and indelible mark on our global organization and I'm especially grateful that he agreed to stay with us until early next year to ensure smooth transition to Jatin. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on this quarter.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I want to thank all of our associates around the world for welcoming me into the Cognizant family 3 years ago and for making my time here such a memorable experience. It has been a pleasure working with so many great people at Cognizant and all of you on this call. I'm confident that I'm leaving the company in great hands with Jatin, who many of you know, is an accomplished CFO and an experienced IT services executive. Over the next several months, I look forward to working with Ravi the Jatin and the rest of the leadership team to ensure a smooth transition. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. We delivered revenue within our guidance range despite a soft discretionary spending environment and ongoing economic uncertainty. Adjusted operating margin exceeded our expectations, reflecting savings from our NextGen program and the timing of investments which is driving some modest upside in our guidance range that I will touch on later. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid bookings growth which continue to be driven by larger longer-duration engagements. Moving on to the details of the quarter; third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of 0.2% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue grew 0.8% but declined 0.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of contributions from our acquisitions. Similar to last quarter, our 9% quarterly bookings growth was driven primarily by larger and longer-duration deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, duration is up over 50% from the prior year period. At the same time, we are continuing to experience softness in the smaller short-duration contracts, driven by weak discretionary spending. This dynamic has negatively impacted our near-term revenue but we believe will put us in a better position to accelerate revenue growth in the future when discretionary spending improves. Moving on to segment results for the third quarter where all growth rates discussed will be in year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 4%, reflecting the softer demand environment across regions and subindustries. This decline was partially offset by the benefit from the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offering strategy that Ravi mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead, we believe the market remains challenging and we expect the macroeconomic uncertainty will again have a meaningful impact for this segment in the fourth quarter. That said, we are working hard to correct what is in our control and I believe we can make meaningful progress under the new subindustry go-to-market approach and leadership. Health Sciences revenue declined 1%. Growth was negatively impacted by a large renewal that we signed earlier this year with a payer customer which resulted in a lower revenue run rate but meaningfully improved profitability. In addition, several of our larger customers have been impacted by their own company-specific and end market challenges which has in turn led to softer discretionary spending. Products and Resources revenue grew less than 1%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, strong performance from utility clients driven by their grid modernization investments and growth among automotive clients in Europe. Growth in these areas was partially offset by pressure in manufacturing. Communications, Media and Technology revenue increased 7%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new contract awards. This includes the expansion of current engagement with our largest customers in this portfolio, who are launching innovative vertical solutions and leveraging our expertise in these areas to rapidly scale globally. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue was down less than 1%, driven by declines within our Financial Services and Health Sciences portfolios. This was partially offset by growth in CMT and Products and Resources. Our global growth markets or GGM which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 1%. Growth was led by Europe which grew 3% and included strong growth within CMT, Life Sciences customers within our Health Sciences segment and Products and Resources. Finally, the resale of third-party products contributed 120 basis points to our overall revenue growth in Q3, the majority of which was in the Financial Services segment. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $72 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.5%. Similar to last quarter, our adjusted operating margin included the negative impact from increased compensation costs attributable to our 2 merit cycles over the last 12 months. This was partially offset by savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.7%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.04 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.16. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion. DSO of 77 days increased 2 days sequentially and 3 days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q3 was $755 million which brings year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $147 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 11 million shares for about $700 million. At quarter end, we had $2.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 3.1% to 0.3% or a decline of 4% to 1.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a benefit of approximately 90 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. Our Q4 revenue guidance range is wider than our historical practice, reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty regarding client discretionary spending and recent pace of decision-making heading into the end of the year. For the full year, we expect revenue will be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.4 billion which is down approximately 0.7% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency, as we do not expect a material impact from foreign exchange rates. This compares to our prior guidance range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion or negative 1% to plus 1% growth in constant currency. We still expect inorganic contribution to be approximately 100 basis points. Our NextGen program remains on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged from last quarter. I'm also pleased to share that we are further reducing our expectations for NextGen costs. We now expect to incur $300 million in total charges versus $350 million previously, with $200 million this year versus $250 million previously. The reduction is a result of lower real estate cost as we are now -- as we now expect to incur about $100 million related to the net consolidation of office space in 2023 versus $150 million previously. This reflects lower expected third-party costs associated with the real estate exits. As we have spoken about previously, we still intend to reinvest the majority of the NextGen savings and growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted operating margin; we are modestly increasing our guidance to 14.7% which is the high end of our prior range. As a reminder, our Q4 operating margin is typically seasonally lower than Q3 levels. We still anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24% and versus the range of 23% to 24% previously provided. In addition, we now expect to deploy approximately $1 billion on share repurchases in 2023 versus our prior expectations of approximately $800 million which assumes an additional $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2023. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.39 in to $4.42 versus $4.25 and $4.48 previously, reflecting our updated expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: So I appreciate you offering the early commentary on the 2024 margin expansion potential. I just want to clarify first that, that's off the base of that 14.7% raised adjusted margin here. And then understanding the environment's quite dynamic. But based on what you're seeing in bookings activity and deal duration and backlog behavior and pipeline, can you share any thoughts or guardrails for 2024 growth now as well?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. So Bryan, I'll catch the easy one first. Yes, the reaffirmation of our intent to expand our margins by 20 to 40 basis points is up midpoint of our expectation or our point of landing at 14.7%, so that's a good assumption. For the bookings momentum, Ravi might be giving you a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the markets.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So Bryan, I've been saying this for the last 2 quarters and this quarter as well. Our deal momentum and our bookings momentum is very strong. We are continuing to see good traction. I've spoken about 2 swim lanes. There is a swim lane on transformation-led deals and I've spoken about cost efficiency, vendor consolidation, efficiency-led kind of deals. We see more in this category versus the transformation but we also see this category underwriting the savings to the transformation. So a lot of times -- remember, one of the things I spoke on my -- in my initial remarks is this is a period of uncertainty and change coming together. So clients are navigating the 2. There is change, significant change ahead of us. And clients are wondering who funds the CapEx cycle. So the ability to take cost out and underwrite the savings to the transformation, I think, is a great template and I think we are well positioned for that. What happens in the short run, though, is the discretionary spend has really fallen over the last 3 quarters. I mean, it's been very, very soft. So the deals we have won in the first and the second quarter, we have to backfill that as well as you know that large deals actually come with a gestation period to get to the peak levels of their potential. So we are hopeful that the large deal momentum continues. It continues over the next year. And of course, the deals we won this year will contribute more to the next year. What I don't know is what happens to discretionary spend. I mean, the environment is very soft. So we'll have to wait and see how the discretionary happens but I'm very optimistic about how the large deal momentum is, especially on cost takeout, vendor consolidation efficiency-led deals that we are seeing across the spectrum. And I think we are winning well. You can see the bookings momentum this year. So the one which is unknown is discretionary. That's the piece we are not sure of. Hopefully, as these deals -- as the cost takeouts continue, if they kind of trigger CapEx cycles for transformation, hopefully, that happens. And if that happens, we are going to catch it early on.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. And then a follow-up here, just on the resale piece of the third-party products. I think you mentioned 120 bps in the quarter, how does that compare to maybe the average over the last 4 to 6 quarters? And are you assuming resale amounts in the forward outlook?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So Bryan, I had spoken about a strategy of large deals with all -- in all swim lanes, all the way from productivity to people takeover to software-led to efficiency-led. And I've spoken about it, that our participation is going to be in all of them. Now sometimes what happens in these situations is you have upstream software coming in and you have downstream services coming in. And it's the timing. I mean, for software upstream, there is significant downstream services which is attached to it. So we've had 60 basis points before in the year that we have added in this quarter. But what you really have to look at is the timing of these deals. Now in quarter 2, we announced a strategic partnership with ServiceNow for $1 billion, a joint partnership. And we have offering which actually has a bundle of software, reusable assets and services attached to it and it is a managed services model. And that's the opportunity we are pursuing. And as the large deals come, you're always going to see the timing. In one particular quarter you could have software, in a particular quarter, you could have services downstream. So it's -- that's the process of how you see this. Sometimes there are people takeover, sometimes there is asset takeover, sometimes there is productivity upfront and effort upfront, sometimes you have transition upfront and you have services on the downstream. So it's hard to pick which quarter you're going to see this. But the nature of large deals gives you that flow, if I may, in terms of how they get constructed quarter-on-quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: I would say, just before I start, Jan, yes, if this is going to be your last earnings call, thank you for all the work and effort over the years. The question is probably since you come to Cognizant, you made a number of changes. You talked about large deal infrastructure. It seems to be in a good place. But how would you rate Cognizant's ability to win and be competitive in the discretionary work that isn't there now but you will need to be competitive in there when it does come back because that, it seems to me, is going to be the difference next year between, say, low single digits and mid-single digits?\nJan Siegmund: Yes, I'll give a little bit of an answer but I think Ravi will be adding much more color to this. The overall position that we have in -- with our clients, I think, has really meaningfully improved over the last 3 or 4 quarters. We have -- in the Net Promoter Scores that Ravi was reporting on is kind of really the statistical leverage of this coming in at a historic high. But we can just see from the comments and the number of escalations is another one. We haven't talked in the call about it but obviously, that has been in parallel coming down. So the service quality has been better. That's partially fueled by low attrition rates. So the overall relationships that we have with our clients have really very meaningfully improved. And I think we have embraced kind of a philosophy of meeting the client where the client has needs. And right now, the needs are more on the structural cost improvement and productivity type, vendor consolidation type deals and discretionary spending has taken the back row. We want to be there for our clients when that discretionary spend comes and the transformative deals are popping up and going part of it. So we're going to be having deep relationships with our clients and the high focus on client relationships and I feel we should be ready for that to do so. Ravi?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So thank you, Jan. I think very well said. So Ashwin, thank you for the question. You're absolutely right. This is -- the large deals muscle is consistently improved over the last 3 quarters. This is something which did not exist before. I came in, in January and built that muscle and I'm very confident that we can sustain it. We've sustained it for 3 quarters and we're very confident we can do that for the future. And we have actually now invested on institutional infrastructure to support it all the way from productivity to automation infrastructure to the classical levers which you apply in managed services and cost takeout kind of deals. We did have good muscle on discretionary before. I mean, the transformation infrastructure of the company is strong. As the spend comes back, I'm very confident that because we have good engagement with our clients, we are also going to naturally be the providers for discretionary spend. You could, in some ways, use the strength of our current deal momentum to support the discretionary -- the historic discretionary muscle of the company. Now, I think Jan raised an important point which I think is very, very important. We ran the Net Promoter Score survey this year and we have historic high scores. And there are 3 or 4 things which have come out of that. Our attrition rates have gone down. They've gone down and they're trending downwards, even into the next quarter. Our employee satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Our client satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Customers are engaging with us much more over a variety of swim lanes which means when the discretionary comes back, each of these swim lanes is going to contribute back to that -- back to the strength of those relationships, so. In fact, there's one thing which really registered with me on the Net Promoter Score survey which is about our customers saying Cognizant is back in some form. I'm paraphrasing it, Cognizant is back or the mojo is back. I think that is the momentum which will allow us to get back the discretionary spend as and when our customers start to spending it. So, I think we have set this foundation, a very strong foundation. The 2 things which our clients have spoken about, as I said, Cognizant is back. The second is we have a much more stable leadership, good execution, agile responses and much lower -- significantly much lower turnover of employees. And these would actually rub off on the discretionary as it comes back.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Good to hear. The second question, again, it's a good job on the margin performance. The question I have is on the deals that you are signing, you mentioned that there is now need to be flexible in terms of structuring, in terms of bringing various partners together and so on and so forth. Does any of what you are doing today to get new deals affect how you think of future margin potential?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. So when we sign up the deals, obviously, they are in a competitive environment and we apply a disciplined approach to those deals in order to keep a balance of growth and continued margin expansion. And it played out this quarter, Ashwin, really, to the benefit of the margin because we had anticipated some investments a little bit stronger than we actually needed in this quarter on, for example, investments into larger deals with maybe initially lower margins and we didn't meet those investments. So I think this view that we have about very carefully layering our large deal portfolio and supporting it with disciplined approach on non-billable and administrative cost controls is playing out. And I think we're entering that year, next year with that confidence that, that balance is intact. And I think I mentioned it in our prior call, in the large deal, expected business profile that we do have deals that we expect to exhibit lower margin profile. But we also have deals that have very meaningfully -- actually, renewals of historic deals that have very meaningfully improved our gross margin profile in the renegotiation. So in the net profile, the impact has been actually more muted and that may not continue all into the future. But for now, it has been a very balanced outcome, I would say.\nRavi Kumar: So Ashwin, we are -- the first thing we just changed is we are participating on deals across the swim lanes I just spoke about and we are competitive enough and we have built the institutional infrastructure to support execution and actually better our performance to the metrics which we commit when we win those deals. So we have to keep strengthening that. This is always a work in progress. We have to continue to stay competitive and we have to continue to price them to win and deliver them to margins as I call it. And we continue to keep our competitiveness by strengthening our productivity tools and our automation tools and our AI tools. So this is an ongoing process and you have to keep changing the baseline because as you want to be competitive, you have to continue to keep working on the productivity levers. Unlike in the past, where these productivity levers were labor-oriented or, I would say, they were classical, now they are technology oriented. And hence, we have a unique opportunity to create some nonlinearity. In the past, we did not participate in those deals. Now we are participating and winning them, so the confidence has been really high.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nTyler DuPont: This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. I wanted to ask about the demand environment you're seeing as we start -- as we look into the end of 2023 and as we start to look into even the beginning of 2024. When looking at the updated revenue guidance being narrowed, I'm just curious what incremental trends you've seen over the past couple of months, whether that's changes in win rates, ramp times or softness, whether that's a particular service offering, vertical, geography, anything like that, that may be driving the additional cautious stance.\nRavi Kumar: I think the cautiousness is related to the uncertainty around the discretionary spend. I think everybody in the market is facing it, including us. What we are certain is our deal momentum and our large deals and our bookings continues to be very vibrant. What we do not know, especially in a seasonally slow quarter, quarter 4 is always a seasonally slow quarter because of furloughs as well. What we are unable to predict is how much of the discretionary gets impacted and how much of our large deal momentum will get neutralized by this. And to that extent, we felt it was only fair that we keep a risk -- we keep the risk adjusted to what we believe could be soft in quarter 4.\nTyler DuPont: Okay, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, just to kind of go even just a little bit deeper into visibility into 2024 budgeting decisions. I know it's still early and you don't give guidance on '24 or anything yet. But just given the current rather choppy macro environment that we're seeing and have seen, can you just speak to sort of the conversations you're having with clients regarding '24 budgets, sort of how does that visibility compare with this time last year? And is there more certainty in certain verticals than others? Or just any clarity there would be very appreciated.\nJan Siegmund: Yes, I'll jump in for -- number one, I think we actually kind of gave a lot of -- half of the P&L we already disclosed because we're really committing to our 40 to 20 basis points of margin expansion. And so now the revenue range, going forward, will be subject to our guidance call in 3 months. But if you -- what we know today is, as Ravi said, that I think, gradually, the economic uncertainty has increased and discretionary spending has softened throughout the last 3 quarters. So we have seen that trend not stopping yet. And part of our lack of knowledge, if it's stopping in the fourth quarter, or if it's going to turn around early in the year or later in the year is really not known to us to be quite honest as well. And clients will be forming their budgets and their IT budget at the same time as we are developing our own budget. So this is kind of always a simultaneous process. What has improved for us is obviously the visibility of the longer-term deals that are now in our portfolio and that they will be contributing and scaling in '24, so that gives us a little bit of a planning safety. And then we have to just kind of really make assumptions on -- and you can do that for your own self. It's like, are you bullish on the discretionary spend and economic development on next year, or are you the same, or more bearish. And I think that will then determine the revenue outcome for next year to do so. I think that's really what we will go under. We haven't finished that process and -- but in February, beginning of February, we'll commit to that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I just want to drill in, maybe for Jan, the TCV versus ACV and how to consider that in the short term the next couple of quarters. I know the book-to-bill is quite high at 1.4. But in terms of translation, with this mix shift toward larger deal, how would you guide us there between ACV and TCV?\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Tien-Tsin, for that. The -- I gave, in my remarks, this duration comment. And I think we had, in previous calls and historically, disclosed that our average duration was roughly around 2 years and now our duration in the bookings is about 3 years, so it's a meaningful increase. And obviously, then ACV, the annual revenue expectations for this is down. And that's actually -- on top, you have also that mix shift. The larger deals need some scaling. So they have -- the ACV is not completely symmetrical because in the first year, you're building up the infrastructure and you're starting transferring assets and do your thing, what you need to do to get ready. So some of the ACV of the larger deals is delayed and will come in '24. And at the same time, we have a decline of deals below $5 million of TCV which are typically deals that always translate in here to revenue. So those things together are basically a 90% explanation of what you see in our revenue trend actuals in the last few quarters. And I'm anticipating unless the discretionary spend is coming back, roaring that, that won't change. Now, so the -- we're entering the year with all these moving parts, probably in a position that is not too different from last year in terms of visibility of revenue going forward, so. And mysteriously, it balances out because some of our larger deals now maturing and scaling, having a little bit better contribution to next year. And then, we'll -- as I said in my prior answer, we'll have our estimate to make on how short-term demand is going to be developing. So the net of it is that factors within the setup have changed compared to the beginning of '23 but in '24, we are kind of approximately in a similar position to stock.\nRavi Kumar: Just to add to that, what Jan said, because we didn't have large deals in the previous year, what -- the slope it had of this year in terms of realizing this year did not happen. What's going to happen for next year, though, is you're going to have tail velocity of deals we won this year which will accrue revenues next year. And then -- and that's a change because we have consistently done it from quarter 1, quarter 2, now quarter 3. We have done -- the percentage of our large deals has gone up. And the percentage of new in these large deals has also gone up, so that's a positive change. The question -- the unknown piece is the discretionary spend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nKeith Bachman: I wanted to follow up on that set of comments. And as you think about next year, you've talked a lot about the large deal program ramping and contributing to revenue growth and mentioned that discretionary is still a headwind. Can you give us a sense of proportionality of how much discretionary is of either revenues, bookings, any kind of metric and how that's changed today from what it is at the beginning year? Because it seems to me, as we start to think about growth, that percentage of low duration deals, if you will, or discretionary spend is at a level such it would be less of a headwind next year as you anniversary the March quarter when it first impacted Cognizant and many others.\nRavi Kumar: It's a difficult question to answer now on how it's going to be next year. I mean, the swim lane of large deals we are doing and then that is 30% of bookings. The swim lane of large deals we're doing, always the savings of those large deals, some of the smarter clients are not necessarily taking it to savings but they are actually underwriting it for transformation which means if some of them can trigger the CapEx cycles, then you're going to see some of that discretionary coming back because the savings you do on productivity will allow you to trigger the CapEx cycle. I mean, I spoke about 150-plus AI -- preliminary early AI engagements. The reality is if they have to scale up, you need the CapEx. The CapEx will either come because our clients have, themselves, navigated the uncertainty and got the CapEx covered, or they would use some of the savings from the cost cutting and the cost takeout they have done related to technology to leverage it into discretionary. I mean, many of my clients today, I've met 270 of them this year. They're not saying they want to take their IT budgets down. What they're really saying is, can you do more for less. And can you actually divert the savings to the transformation they're looking forward to and they're very, very anxious about the transformation because we are all living in this period of change. The issue is -- what I do not know is whether the economic and the overall environment which is really a headwind, is that going to change significantly next year? That's something that's hard to predict now. But if that uncertainty continues, you're obviously not going to see the discretionary spend coming back. But if you see that triggering positively, then you're going to see the savings of these cost takeout initiatives to move into transformation and that will trigger another cycle of spend which in turn, hopefully, will trigger revenue cycles for our clients which will then hopefully create a virtuous positive cycle. So it's a tricky one to answer. You need a trigger for the CapEx cycles of discretionary. And all the discretionary spend, as Jan mentioned, these are all deals between $0 to $10 million. They all get they all get realized within the same year because these are small deals. So it's a very unusual time, a time of uncertainty and a time of change coming simultaneously. So the cost takeout deals potentially can fund them and that's the point I'm making. And if they don't, then there are other triggers of CapEx cycles which have to fund them.\nKeith Bachman: Okay. Okay. Jan, I wanted to also thank you for all the work you've done over the last couple of years. And then direct to question, as you think about the 20 to 40 basis point range for margin improvement next year. I know you don't want to give metrics associated with revenue but just, how do you think about the upper end versus the lower end? In other words, is it as simple as discretionary comes back and that has greater OpEx leverage? Or is there anything else, puts and takes that we should be thinking about? And particularly, you did mention that the large deal ramps can and indeed, in many cases, have lower margin profiles. Just any puts and takes that you want us to think about as it relates to the 20 to 40 basis points range.\nJan Siegmund: Look, we're entering the year with the NextGen initiative executing well and according to our plans. And we're going to have what were -- some impact in the third quarter but really not full run rate impact yet. And so we will have a lot of momentum on NextGen next year. So we offered the savings opportunity for '24 to -- for '25 to REIT, in real estate, $100 million savings. And you all have your own assumptions on our head count reduction program, easy to be calculated and that's a lot of efficiency that we can book on our side. I anticipate the revenue momentum is obviously the mix factor for us that will shift. And in that revenue growth factor that determines the scale of our SG&A development and other elements, it's kind of probably a big factor. And the second one I would give to you is the style and the execution of our large deal scaling. With larger deals, there is a little bit of risk factor just by the nature of their scope involved. And if we are executing well and the deals don't develop problems, that will help us to be very solid in our margin expectation. And if we run into some problems, maybe we'll need to invest a little bit more cost. So those will be the 2 major factors, I think, that we're going to be considering as we give our margin range and the substantiation of it.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So also just to add to what Jan said, the NextGen program really kicked off at the end of quarter 1. We had impact in quarter 2 and quarter 3. It will have a full year impact next year. I mean, the savings will accrue next year. And of course, the real estate savings come at the back end as well. So we have -- now we have -- we are going to look at incorporating that into our workings as we work out the next year next year margins. And that's one of the reasons why we reiterated that the 20 to 40 basis points we set early in this year. We probably have -- we wanted to reinforce that message that we can get that margin expansion which we earlier committed in the year.\nOperator: Our final question of the night will come from the line of Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.\nJames Friedman: I was wondering if you could share some high-level observations, really, about in-sourcing trends. Is that any different than usual? Do you see acceleration or deceleration? And do you see that as friend or foe?\nRavi Kumar: That's great question. I see that as a friend. In fact, I stated that if you carefully observe my initial comments, even before you asked this question, I had stated that if technology is strategic to our clients. And remember, technology was an enabler for our clients. Now it is strategic to them because is deeply embedded into their products. It is integral to the differentiation in the market. Every industry is a tech industry. We have to help our clients build their own technology muscle. And to help our clients build their own technology muscle, I think Cognizant is probably best suited to do so. Our entrepreneurial spirit, our flexible operating model, our co-creation attitude and our co-creation culture. We think, as companies build their own technology muscle, we will lend our human capital and I stated this in my remarks, that we would even lend this value chain of human capital which is not just the people to support their transformation but potentially lending our training infrastructure, our learning infrastructure, our ability to actually help them build their own captives if they want to, or global capability centers. And I think that is sticky because once you do so, you can even lend your automation infrastructure, AI infrastructure and actually take them through that maturity curve. So it's much more sticky than before. So I see this as an unique opportunity for Cognizant and we want to double down on this offering.\nJames Friedman: And then, you emphasized in your prepared remarks and it did not go unnoticed the sequential increase in the head count. And you're one of the few companies, at least that I'm aware of, that's growing their head count. So my question about that is are you anticipating, I would assume increased utilization and realization from that head count? Because the commitment to the head count is what we think of as a leading indicator -- so -- but where are you planning to deploy those people? And what gives you the confidence to be growing them right now?\nRavi Kumar: After very many quarters, we had sequential positive head count growth. Of course, it is a tiny number but it is reflective of the momentum of -- the commercial momentum of large deals and bookings. It is reflective of the needs for the future and it is reflective of the needs of the near future. So I'm very, very -- I'm very confident that if we continue on the deal booking momentum, we will have to increase our head count to fulfill and satisfy those programs. So it's encouraging -- it's a very encouraging indicator about how well our commercial momentum is shaping up.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you all very much for joining. We look forward to catching up next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I want to thank all of our associates around the world for welcoming me into the Cognizant family 3 years ago and for making my time here such a memorable experience. It has been a pleasure working with so many great people at Cognizant and all of you on this call. I'm confident that I'm leaving the company in great hands with Jatin, who many of you know, is an accomplished CFO and an experienced IT services executive. Over the next several months, I look forward to working with Ravi the Jatin and the rest of the leadership team to ensure a smooth transition. With that, let's turn to our third quarter results. We delivered revenue within our guidance range despite a soft discretionary spending environment and ongoing economic uncertainty. Adjusted operating margin exceeded our expectations, reflecting savings from our NextGen program and the timing of investments which is driving some modest upside in our guidance range that I will touch on later. We were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid bookings growth which continue to be driven by larger longer-duration engagements. Moving on to the details of the quarter; third quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of 0.2% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue grew 0.8% but declined 0.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 110 basis points of contributions from our acquisitions. Similar to last quarter, our 9% quarterly bookings growth was driven primarily by larger and longer-duration deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, duration is up over 50% from the prior year period. At the same time, we are continuing to experience softness in the smaller short-duration contracts, driven by weak discretionary spending. This dynamic has negatively impacted our near-term revenue but we believe will put us in a better position to accelerate revenue growth in the future when discretionary spending improves. Moving on to segment results for the third quarter where all growth rates discussed will be in year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 4%, reflecting the softer demand environment across regions and subindustries. This decline was partially offset by the benefit from the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offering strategy that Ravi mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks. Looking ahead, we believe the market remains challenging and we expect the macroeconomic uncertainty will again have a meaningful impact for this segment in the fourth quarter. That said, we are working hard to correct what is in our control and I believe we can make meaningful progress under the new subindustry go-to-market approach and leadership. Health Sciences revenue declined 1%. Growth was negatively impacted by a large renewal that we signed earlier this year with a payer customer which resulted in a lower revenue run rate but meaningfully improved profitability. In addition, several of our larger customers have been impacted by their own company-specific and end market challenges which has in turn led to softer discretionary spending. Products and Resources revenue grew less than 1%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, strong performance from utility clients driven by their grid modernization investments and growth among automotive clients in Europe. Growth in these areas was partially offset by pressure in manufacturing. Communications, Media and Technology revenue increased 7%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions and the ramp of new contract awards. This includes the expansion of current engagement with our largest customers in this portfolio, who are launching innovative vertical solutions and leveraging our expertise in these areas to rapidly scale globally. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q3, North America revenue was down less than 1%, driven by declines within our Financial Services and Health Sciences portfolios. This was partially offset by growth in CMT and Products and Resources. Our global growth markets or GGM which include all revenue outside of North America grew approximately 1%. Growth was led by Europe which grew 3% and included strong growth within CMT, Life Sciences customers within our Health Sciences segment and Products and Resources. Finally, the resale of third-party products contributed 120 basis points to our overall revenue growth in Q3, the majority of which was in the Financial Services segment. Now, moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $72 million of costs related to our NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 150 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.5%. Similar to last quarter, our adjusted operating margin included the negative impact from increased compensation costs attributable to our 2 merit cycles over the last 12 months. This was partially offset by savings from our NextGen program and tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 26.8%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25.7%. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.04 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.16. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.4 billion, or net cash of $1.7 billion. DSO of 77 days increased 2 days sequentially and 3 days year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q3 was $755 million which brings year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year, we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million under our share repurchase program and returned $147 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 11 million shares for about $700 million. At quarter end, we had $2.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.69 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 3.1% to 0.3% or a decline of 4% to 1.2% in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a benefit of approximately 90 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. Our Q4 revenue guidance range is wider than our historical practice, reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty regarding client discretionary spending and recent pace of decision-making heading into the end of the year. For the full year, we expect revenue will be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.4 billion which is down approximately 0.7% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency, as we do not expect a material impact from foreign exchange rates. This compares to our prior guidance range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion or negative 1% to plus 1% growth in constant currency. We still expect inorganic contribution to be approximately 100 basis points. Our NextGen program remains on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged from last quarter. I'm also pleased to share that we are further reducing our expectations for NextGen costs. We now expect to incur $300 million in total charges versus $350 million previously, with $200 million this year versus $250 million previously. The reduction is a result of lower real estate cost as we are now -- as we now expect to incur about $100 million related to the net consolidation of office space in 2023 versus $150 million previously. This reflects lower expected third-party costs associated with the real estate exits. As we have spoken about previously, we still intend to reinvest the majority of the NextGen savings and growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond. Moving on to adjusted operating margin; we are modestly increasing our guidance to 14.7% which is the high end of our prior range. As a reminder, our Q4 operating margin is typically seasonally lower than Q3 levels. We still anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24% and versus the range of 23% to 24% previously provided. In addition, we now expect to deploy approximately $1 billion on share repurchases in 2023 versus our prior expectations of approximately $800 million which assumes an additional $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. In total, we expect to return approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2023. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.39 in to $4.42 versus $4.25 and $4.48 previously, reflecting our updated expectations for revenue and adjusted operating margin. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. So Bryan, I'll catch the easy one first. Yes, the reaffirmation of our intent to expand our margins by 20 to 40 basis points is up midpoint of our expectation or our point of landing at 14.7%, so that's a good assumption. For the bookings momentum, Ravi might be giving you a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the markets. Yes, I'll give a little bit of an answer but I think Ravi will be adding much more color to this. The overall position that we have in -- with our clients, I think, has really meaningfully improved over the last 3 or 4 quarters. We have -- in the Net Promoter Scores that Ravi was reporting on is kind of really the statistical leverage of this coming in at a historic high. But we can just see from the comments and the number of escalations is another one. We haven't talked in the call about it but obviously, that has been in parallel coming down. So the service quality has been better. That's partially fueled by low attrition rates. So the overall relationships that we have with our clients have really very meaningfully improved. And I think we have embraced kind of a philosophy of meeting the client where the client has needs. And right now, the needs are more on the structural cost improvement and productivity type, vendor consolidation type deals and discretionary spending has taken the back row. We want to be there for our clients when that discretionary spend comes and the transformative deals are popping up and going part of it. So we're going to be having deep relationships with our clients and the high focus on client relationships and I feel we should be ready for that to do so. Ravi? Yes. So when we sign up the deals, obviously, they are in a competitive environment and we apply a disciplined approach to those deals in order to keep a balance of growth and continued margin expansion. And it played out this quarter, Ashwin, really, to the benefit of the margin because we had anticipated some investments a little bit stronger than we actually needed in this quarter on, for example, investments into larger deals with maybe initially lower margins and we didn't meet those investments. So I think this view that we have about very carefully layering our large deal portfolio and supporting it with disciplined approach on non-billable and administrative cost controls is playing out. And I think we're entering that year, next year with that confidence that, that balance is intact. And I think I mentioned it in our prior call, in the large deal, expected business profile that we do have deals that we expect to exhibit lower margin profile. But we also have deals that have very meaningfully -- actually, renewals of historic deals that have very meaningfully improved our gross margin profile in the renegotiation. So in the net profile, the impact has been actually more muted and that may not continue all into the future. But for now, it has been a very balanced outcome, I would say. Yes, I'll jump in for -- number one, I think we actually kind of gave a lot of -- half of the P&L we already disclosed because we're really committing to our 40 to 20 basis points of margin expansion. And so now the revenue range, going forward, will be subject to our guidance call in 3 months. But if you -- what we know today is, as Ravi said, that I think, gradually, the economic uncertainty has increased and discretionary spending has softened throughout the last 3 quarters. So we have seen that trend not stopping yet. And part of our lack of knowledge, if it's stopping in the fourth quarter, or if it's going to turn around early in the year or later in the year is really not known to us to be quite honest as well. And clients will be forming their budgets and their IT budget at the same time as we are developing our own budget. So this is kind of always a simultaneous process. What has improved for us is obviously the visibility of the longer-term deals that are now in our portfolio and that they will be contributing and scaling in '24, so that gives us a little bit of a planning safety. And then we have to just kind of really make assumptions on -- and you can do that for your own self. It's like, are you bullish on the discretionary spend and economic development on next year, or are you the same, or more bearish. And I think that will then determine the revenue outcome for next year to do so. I think that's really what we will go under. We haven't finished that process and -- but in February, beginning of February, we'll commit to that. Thank you, Tien-Tsin, for that. The -- I gave, in my remarks, this duration comment. And I think we had, in previous calls and historically, disclosed that our average duration was roughly around 2 years and now our duration in the bookings is about 3 years, so it's a meaningful increase. And obviously, then ACV, the annual revenue expectations for this is down. And that's actually -- on top, you have also that mix shift. The larger deals need some scaling. So they have -- the ACV is not completely symmetrical because in the first year, you're building up the infrastructure and you're starting transferring assets and do your thing, what you need to do to get ready. So some of the ACV of the larger deals is delayed and will come in '24. And at the same time, we have a decline of deals below $5 million of TCV which are typically deals that always translate in here to revenue. So those things together are basically a 90% explanation of what you see in our revenue trend actuals in the last few quarters. And I'm anticipating unless the discretionary spend is coming back, roaring that, that won't change. Now, so the -- we're entering the year with all these moving parts, probably in a position that is not too different from last year in terms of visibility of revenue going forward, so. And mysteriously, it balances out because some of our larger deals now maturing and scaling, having a little bit better contribution to next year. And then, we'll -- as I said in my prior answer, we'll have our estimate to make on how short-term demand is going to be developing. So the net of it is that factors within the setup have changed compared to the beginning of '23 but in '24, we are kind of approximately in a similar position to stock. Look, we're entering the year with the NextGen initiative executing well and according to our plans. And we're going to have what were -- some impact in the third quarter but really not full run rate impact yet. And so we will have a lot of momentum on NextGen next year. So we offered the savings opportunity for '24 to -- for '25 to REIT, in real estate, $100 million savings. And you all have your own assumptions on our head count reduction program, easy to be calculated and that's a lot of efficiency that we can book on our side. I anticipate the revenue momentum is obviously the mix factor for us that will shift. And in that revenue growth factor that determines the scale of our SG&A development and other elements, it's kind of probably a big factor. And the second one I would give to you is the style and the execution of our large deal scaling. With larger deals, there is a little bit of risk factor just by the nature of their scope involved. And if we are executing well and the deals don't develop problems, that will help us to be very solid in our margin expectation. And if we run into some problems, maybe we'll need to invest a little bit more cost. So those will be the 2 major factors, I think, that we're going to be considering as we give our margin range and the substantiation of it."

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I would like to cover 3 topics: our third quarter results, the demand environment and a brief update on our strategic priorities. We are pleased with the company's continued progress in the third quarter, during which clients remained cautious amid economic uncertainty and discretionary spend was under pressure. Q3 revenue came in at $4.9 billion, within our guidance range. We saw sequential revenue growth of 20 basis points year-over-year. Revenue grew 0.8% as reported or a modest decline of 20 basis points in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin of 15.5% exceeded our expectations, mostly reflecting savings from our next generation program which remains on track as well as from our operational discipline and the timing of spend on investment opportunities. We recorded another quarter of bookings growth, up approximately 9% year-over-year. We ended Q3 with a record trailing 12-month bookings growth of $26.9 billion, up 16% year-over-year and a strong book-to-bill of 1.4x. We have sustained our large deal momentum through Q3. Approximately 30% of our in-quarter Q3 bookings were large deals and 3 of these deals exceeded $100 million each. I believe we are getting progressively better at building a creative deal generation engine and solutioning large deals. I am especially encouraged to see our continued decline in attrition. Trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our tech services business declined to 16.2%, down about 4 percentage points sequentially and down 13 points year-over-year. This decline in attrition was a positive factor in our just completed annual client Net Promoter Score survey which showed significant improvement year-over-year and hit a historic high for Cognizant. Clients let us know that leadership, account management and delivery are especially important to them. And the survey results show that in these areas, we're doing a great job. This assessment of how clients perceive Cognizant underscores the interdependence of the employee and client experience that gives us confidence that the changes we are making will help strengthen the portfolio over the long run. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. We continue to reposition our Financial Services segment, while responding to an increasingly challenged demand environment. One of the ways we are striving to reinvigorate growth is through a sharply focused subindustry go-to-market approach in the Americas directly by highly experienced leaders. We believe this change will increase our agility and deepen our domain expertise. Let's turn to the demand environment and what I'm hearing from clients. Clients remain focused on efficiency initiatives to reduce costs and consolidate providers as they increase their productivity and resilience and we are helping them do so. This should, in turn, enable them to underwrite their continuing investment in digital transformation. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our relationship with Lineage, a global leader in temperature-controlled logistics to help build an industry-leading operating platform and establish a plan to support their operations through automation and infrastructure management. We also established a new multiyear relationship with Swedish firm, Intrum. We expect to provide end-to-end digital integration and core modernization services for their credit management technology platform. To dive deeper into clients' long-term objectives and discover new ways to strengthen our partnership with them, Cognizant held a 2-day Discovery Summit last month for about 130 of our North America clients, our first large-scale client gathering in more than 4 years. We discussed the transformative power of generative AI and how we believe it can reshape every industry. We showed clients how to apply generative AI to create more connected, collaborative and responsive relationships with their customers. We also ran live use cases at Cognizant's new AI platform, showing generative AI working alongside legacy data and machine learning models to rapidly create end-to-end AI use cases to tackle client KPIs. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next 3 years, focusing on areas such as platform modernization infrastructure, recruiting and upskilling. To that end, we opened a dedicated AI innovation studio in London. And later this year, we expect to OpenAI studios in New York, Dallas and Bangalore. We have trained about 55,000 of our employees in generative AI this year and have an additional 40,000 employees from all levels of our company registered in pursuing training on Gen AI. We have also invested in AI partnerships and experimental infrastructure to support early client engagements. We believe clients will depend on partners like Cognizant to generate significant productivity gains through automated AI-powered platforms for design, engineering and operations. This shift in client behavior further validates a recently refined strategy which is aimed at strengthening Cognizant's differentiation to help drive growth. Our strategy is focused on 3 imperatives. First, we are resolved to be an industry-led, creating value for clients by integrating technology with industry use cases to drive business outcomes. We are embedding industry expertise across our value chain and select industries. We are developing more enterprise scale platforms designed for industry and operational use cases. Partnerships have a major role to play here. We are focused on expanding our partner ecosystem across a range of technology providers. Among them, hyperscalers, cloud providers, enterprise software companies, digital software enterprises and emerging start-ups. We believe this partner ecosystem will enable us to enhance our integrated offering by combining third-party products with our service solutions, helping to deliver enterprise-wide digital transformation. We believe this strategy as a full stack provider opens new and significant managed services opportunities. Second, given today's more heterogeneous technology landscape and the desire of many clients to build their own technology muscle, we focus on operating a highly flexible business model to meet clients where they are in their digital transformation journeys. We can support them across a range of project types, whether that's structured deals, traditional managed services, build-operate-transfer, co-innovation, partner solutions or large technology transformations. And to help clients strengthen their technology expertise, we can either lend our human capital along with our human capital value chain which includes learning, development, automation and AI infrastructure and more. Our business model flexibility is well suited to the changing nature of large deals where we see increasing demand for bundling services, often a combination of software people takeover infrastructure and services. These deals have a potential to bring Cognizant into the heart of clients' business landscape, putting us in a strong position to capture future services opportunities. Our third imperative is to enable more intimate levels of client collaboration and co-innovation. This effort grows out of our heritage of client centricity and grassroots innovation. Given the scale and diversity of our global teams, we believe we have a potential to harvest an abundance of ideas, big and small, that can contribute to our clients' focus. Inspired by our BlueBolt's grassroots innovation movement launched in quarter 2, more than 35,000 of our employees have generated 75,000 ideas. We have already implemented about 14,000 of these ideas, nearly 6,000 of which are client-facing. A strengthened ability to co-innovate with clients is especially valuable as they grapple with understanding and applying generative AI. During the quarter, we launched Telco Assurance 360; a cloud-based AI-powered solution built on ServiceNow and designed to provide telcos with real-time visibility into network issues and fast proactive resolution through AI-powered analytics. We also signed a multiyear agreement with a leading provider of digital and cloud-enabled solutions that are vital to the administration of health and human services programs across the U.S. Cognizant will serve as the client's sole global IT services and operations partner to help drive transformation at scale. We also provide the client with access to our AI, machine learning and generated AI tools, along with our TriZetto platform to advance revenue growth, increase administrative efficiency and improve the member experience. What's more, we are expanding our strategic collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies to jointly implement the AI-based solutions at the edge as a part of our Car-to-Cloud initiative. We encourage our clients who want to transform their businesses by being AI first to begin the journey by modernizing the data architecture, cloud infrastructure and core business applications. Today, we are running more than 150-plus early client engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI. Some of the examples of this work include general productivity use cases related to writing code, code analysis and troubleshooting, knowledge management and translating product specs into natural chat or speech, business specific use cases for call center automation product prototyping, audience prediction, claims management, medical scribing and research and development; and domain specific use cases like onboarding new employees, validating deep documents and financial statement planning analytics. We have 300-plus additional opportunities in our pipeline that we are planning to scale. Let's turn to a quick update on our 3 long-term strategic objectives, starting with becoming an employer of choice in our industry. I see Cognizant as a human capital company, first; and a technology company, second. Everything we do hinges on the quality, dedication and scale of our talent base. That's why it is so consequential that our voluntary attrition continues to fall, putting us on par with the industry average. We expect further improvement in our attrition in quarter 4. It's also worth noting that in quarter 3, we had a net sequential head count increase for the first time in several quarters. As a human capital company, we are determined to help improve the lives of workers around the world. With that in mind, we announced a ground-breaking training initiative yesterday called Cognizant Synapse Initiative, a job training endeavor, is aimed at empowering more than 1 million individuals with the advanced technology skills, including generative AI and that, they will need to thrive in the digital economy. We intend to build a consortium of partners for training and jobs which will then employ individuals who have upskilled through our Synapse Initiative. Our next performance objective is to accelerate revenue growth. When I joined Cognizant in January, I said large deals are one of my top priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we are pleased to see our continuing large deals momentum which is underpinned by the work we are doing to improve the capabilities required to seed, shape and sell large deals and our ongoing investment in the client-facing roles needed for driving growth. These efforts have helped to partially offset what remains a softer discretionary spending environment and provides new growth opportunities following last year's muted bookings growth. Our third performance objective is to ensure operational excellence across the company. We remain focused on simplifying our operations, including a sales and delivery structure so we can continue to become more agile and get closer to clients and their unique business challenges. In general, we are operating with fewer layers, optimizing our day-to-day operations with enhanced systems and tools and working to streamline our processes and automate information flows using AI. Differentiation in the tech services industry happens at the clients' side and the project level, making relationships and strong execution key. That's why I've invested so much time in meeting with over 270 clients so far this year, building trust and learning all I can about Cognizant can deliver more value to them. Over the past 3 quarters, I believe Cognizant has made meaningful progress on our long-term priorities. While we have a lot of work ahead, we also have much to be proud of. This includes continuing large deals momentum, improved employee and client satisfaction scores, declining attrition, the scaling of our industry leadership with a platform-centered approach, heightened operational discipline and the launch of a grassroots innovation movement. Looking ahead, we believe the soft demand environment is unlikely to see a rapid rebound. Therefore, we expect clients to continue tempering the discretionary spending as we begin the new year. Given that market reality, we remain focused on winning efficiency-led large deals aimed at cost takeout and vendor consolidation which can offset current pressure on discretionary spending. Our focus on operating discipline and our year-to-date progress on the NextGen program gives us confidence that we can meet our expectation to deliver our 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion next year. Jan will share more detail on NextGen in a moment. Taking a longer view with my read of business history, periods of great uncertainty and periods of change rarely coincide. Today, I believe we are in just such a period of simultaneous great uncertainty and deep-seated change. The uncertainty is being compounded by a number of intertwined domestic and international risks. What can become a transformative change is being driven primarily by new general-purpose technologies with immense power such as generative AI which I believe could become as ubiquitous and consequential for business as society as the Internet did 3 decades ago. I expect this reality will leave most clients. However, focused they are on navigating uncertainty with no choice but to make some big bets if they are not to be left behind by the peers. I believe Cognizant is in a position -- in a great position to prepare them for this future, whether by helping them achieve significant savings to underwrite investments in transformation or by helping them build their own technology muscle which can include becoming fully AI-ready. In closing, you are all aware that we recently appointed Jatin Dalal to be Cognizant's next Chief Financial Officer and we're excited that he will be joining us in December. Since this is Jan's last earnings call with Cognizant, I want you all to know that what a powerful partner he's been to me across so many dimensions: strategic, financial, operational and cultural. He left a positive and indelible mark on our global organization and I'm especially grateful that he agreed to stay with us until early next year to ensure smooth transition to Jatin. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on this quarter. Yes. So Bryan, I've been saying this for the last 2 quarters and this quarter as well. Our deal momentum and our bookings momentum is very strong. We are continuing to see good traction. I've spoken about 2 swim lanes. There is a swim lane on transformation-led deals and I've spoken about cost efficiency, vendor consolidation, efficiency-led kind of deals. We see more in this category versus the transformation but we also see this category underwriting the savings to the transformation. So a lot of times -- remember, one of the things I spoke on my -- in my initial remarks is this is a period of uncertainty and change coming together. So clients are navigating the 2. There is change, significant change ahead of us. And clients are wondering who funds the CapEx cycle. So the ability to take cost out and underwrite the savings to the transformation, I think, is a great template and I think we are well positioned for that. What happens in the short run, though, is the discretionary spend has really fallen over the last 3 quarters. I mean, it's been very, very soft. So the deals we have won in the first and the second quarter, we have to backfill that as well as you know that large deals actually come with a gestation period to get to the peak levels of their potential. So we are hopeful that the large deal momentum continues. It continues over the next year. And of course, the deals we won this year will contribute more to the next year. What I don't know is what happens to discretionary spend. I mean, the environment is very soft. So we'll have to wait and see how the discretionary happens but I'm very optimistic about how the large deal momentum is, especially on cost takeout, vendor consolidation efficiency-led deals that we are seeing across the spectrum. And I think we are winning well. You can see the bookings momentum this year. So the one which is unknown is discretionary. That's the piece we are not sure of. Hopefully, as these deals -- as the cost takeouts continue, if they kind of trigger CapEx cycles for transformation, hopefully, that happens. And if that happens, we are going to catch it early on. Yes. So Bryan, I had spoken about a strategy of large deals with all -- in all swim lanes, all the way from productivity to people takeover to software-led to efficiency-led. And I've spoken about it, that our participation is going to be in all of them. Now sometimes what happens in these situations is you have upstream software coming in and you have downstream services coming in. And it's the timing. I mean, for software upstream, there is significant downstream services which is attached to it. So we've had 60 basis points before in the year that we have added in this quarter. But what you really have to look at is the timing of these deals. Now in quarter 2, we announced a strategic partnership with ServiceNow for $1 billion, a joint partnership. And we have offering which actually has a bundle of software, reusable assets and services attached to it and it is a managed services model. And that's the opportunity we are pursuing. And as the large deals come, you're always going to see the timing. In one particular quarter you could have software, in a particular quarter, you could have services downstream. So it's -- that's the process of how you see this. Sometimes there are people takeover, sometimes there is asset takeover, sometimes there is productivity upfront and effort upfront, sometimes you have transition upfront and you have services on the downstream. So it's hard to pick which quarter you're going to see this. But the nature of large deals gives you that flow, if I may, in terms of how they get constructed quarter-on-quarter. Yes. So thank you, Jan. I think very well said. So Ashwin, thank you for the question. You're absolutely right. This is -- the large deals muscle is consistently improved over the last 3 quarters. This is something which did not exist before. I came in, in January and built that muscle and I'm very confident that we can sustain it. We've sustained it for 3 quarters and we're very confident we can do that for the future. And we have actually now invested on institutional infrastructure to support it all the way from productivity to automation infrastructure to the classical levers which you apply in managed services and cost takeout kind of deals. We did have good muscle on discretionary before. I mean, the transformation infrastructure of the company is strong. As the spend comes back, I'm very confident that because we have good engagement with our clients, we are also going to naturally be the providers for discretionary spend. You could, in some ways, use the strength of our current deal momentum to support the discretionary -- the historic discretionary muscle of the company. Now, I think Jan raised an important point which I think is very, very important. We ran the Net Promoter Score survey this year and we have historic high scores. And there are 3 or 4 things which have come out of that. Our attrition rates have gone down. They've gone down and they're trending downwards, even into the next quarter. Our employee satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Our client satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. Customers are engaging with us much more over a variety of swim lanes which means when the discretionary comes back, each of these swim lanes is going to contribute back to that -- back to the strength of those relationships, so. In fact, there's one thing which really registered with me on the Net Promoter Score survey which is about our customers saying Cognizant is back in some form. I'm paraphrasing it, Cognizant is back or the mojo is back. I think that is the momentum which will allow us to get back the discretionary spend as and when our customers start to spending it. So, I think we have set this foundation, a very strong foundation. The 2 things which our clients have spoken about, as I said, Cognizant is back. The second is we have a much more stable leadership, good execution, agile responses and much lower -- significantly much lower turnover of employees. And these would actually rub off on the discretionary as it comes back. So Ashwin, we are -- the first thing we just changed is we are participating on deals across the swim lanes I just spoke about and we are competitive enough and we have built the institutional infrastructure to support execution and actually better our performance to the metrics which we commit when we win those deals. So we have to keep strengthening that. This is always a work in progress. We have to continue to stay competitive and we have to continue to price them to win and deliver them to margins as I call it. And we continue to keep our competitiveness by strengthening our productivity tools and our automation tools and our AI tools. So this is an ongoing process and you have to keep changing the baseline because as you want to be competitive, you have to continue to keep working on the productivity levers. Unlike in the past, where these productivity levers were labor-oriented or, I would say, they were classical, now they are technology oriented. And hence, we have a unique opportunity to create some nonlinearity. In the past, we did not participate in those deals. Now we are participating and winning them, so the confidence has been really high. I think the cautiousness is related to the uncertainty around the discretionary spend. I think everybody in the market is facing it, including us. What we are certain is our deal momentum and our large deals and our bookings continues to be very vibrant. What we do not know, especially in a seasonally slow quarter, quarter 4 is always a seasonally slow quarter because of furloughs as well. What we are unable to predict is how much of the discretionary gets impacted and how much of our large deal momentum will get neutralized by this. And to that extent, we felt it was only fair that we keep a risk -- we keep the risk adjusted to what we believe could be soft in quarter 4. Just to add to that, what Jan said, because we didn't have large deals in the previous year, what -- the slope it had of this year in terms of realizing this year did not happen. What's going to happen for next year, though, is you're going to have tail velocity of deals we won this year which will accrue revenues next year. And then -- and that's a change because we have consistently done it from quarter 1, quarter 2, now quarter 3. We have done -- the percentage of our large deals has gone up. And the percentage of new in these large deals has also gone up, so that's a positive change. The question -- the unknown piece is the discretionary spend. It's a difficult question to answer now on how it's going to be next year. I mean, the swim lane of large deals we are doing and then that is 30% of bookings. The swim lane of large deals we're doing, always the savings of those large deals, some of the smarter clients are not necessarily taking it to savings but they are actually underwriting it for transformation which means if some of them can trigger the CapEx cycles, then you're going to see some of that discretionary coming back because the savings you do on productivity will allow you to trigger the CapEx cycle. I mean, I spoke about 150-plus AI -- preliminary early AI engagements. The reality is if they have to scale up, you need the CapEx. The CapEx will either come because our clients have, themselves, navigated the uncertainty and got the CapEx covered, or they would use some of the savings from the cost cutting and the cost takeout they have done related to technology to leverage it into discretionary. I mean, many of my clients today, I've met 270 of them this year. They're not saying they want to take their IT budgets down. What they're really saying is, can you do more for less. And can you actually divert the savings to the transformation they're looking forward to and they're very, very anxious about the transformation because we are all living in this period of change. The issue is -- what I do not know is whether the economic and the overall environment which is really a headwind, is that going to change significantly next year? That's something that's hard to predict now. But if that uncertainty continues, you're obviously not going to see the discretionary spend coming back. But if you see that triggering positively, then you're going to see the savings of these cost takeout initiatives to move into transformation and that will trigger another cycle of spend which in turn, hopefully, will trigger revenue cycles for our clients which will then hopefully create a virtuous positive cycle. So it's a tricky one to answer. You need a trigger for the CapEx cycles of discretionary. And all the discretionary spend, as Jan mentioned, these are all deals between $0 to $10 million. They all get they all get realized within the same year because these are small deals. So it's a very unusual time, a time of uncertainty and a time of change coming simultaneously. So the cost takeout deals potentially can fund them and that's the point I'm making. And if they don't, then there are other triggers of CapEx cycles which have to fund them. Yes. So also just to add to what Jan said, the NextGen program really kicked off at the end of quarter 1. We had impact in quarter 2 and quarter 3. It will have a full year impact next year. I mean, the savings will accrue next year. And of course, the real estate savings come at the back end as well. So we have -- now we have -- we are going to look at incorporating that into our workings as we work out the next year next year margins. And that's one of the reasons why we reiterated that the 20 to 40 basis points we set early in this year. We probably have -- we wanted to reinforce that message that we can get that margin expansion which we earlier committed in the year. That's great question. I see that as a friend. In fact, I stated that if you carefully observe my initial comments, even before you asked this question, I had stated that if technology is strategic to our clients. And remember, technology was an enabler for our clients. Now it is strategic to them because is deeply embedded into their products. It is integral to the differentiation in the market. Every industry is a tech industry. We have to help our clients build their own technology muscle. And to help our clients build their own technology muscle, I think Cognizant is probably best suited to do so. Our entrepreneurial spirit, our flexible operating model, our co-creation attitude and our co-creation culture. We think, as companies build their own technology muscle, we will lend our human capital and I stated this in my remarks, that we would even lend this value chain of human capital which is not just the people to support their transformation but potentially lending our training infrastructure, our learning infrastructure, our ability to actually help them build their own captives if they want to, or global capability centers. And I think that is sticky because once you do so, you can even lend your automation infrastructure, AI infrastructure and actually take them through that maturity curve. So it's much more sticky than before. So I see this as an unique opportunity for Cognizant and we want to double down on this offering. After very many quarters, we had sequential positive head count growth. Of course, it is a tiny number but it is reflective of the momentum of -- the commercial momentum of large deals and bookings. It is reflective of the needs for the future and it is reflective of the needs of the near future. So I'm very, very -- I'm very confident that if we continue on the deal booking momentum, we will have to increase our head count to fulfill and satisfy those programs. So it's encouraging -- it's a very encouraging indicator about how well our commercial momentum is shaping up."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Cognizant Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tyler Scott, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's second quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to discuss four topics with you today. Our second quarter results, the demand environment of comprehensive commitment to generative AI and an update on our long-term priorities. We made continued progress during the quarter in what remains an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. Q2 came in at $4.9 billion at the high end of our guidance range. We were pleased to return to sequential revenue growth of more than 1%. Year-over-year Q2 revenue showed a modest decline of 40 basis points or essentially flat in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.2% and adjusted EPS was $1.10. We recorded another quarter of strong bookings growth 17% year-over-year ending quarter two with record trailing 12-months bookings of $26.4 billion. A book-to-bill of 1.4x approximately 30% of our in quarter Q2 bookings were large deals and five of this deals exceeded $100 million each. Our bookings continue to be a balance mix of renewables, extensions and new opportunities. The leadership team and I remain intensely focused on a talent. So I am glad to see the continued reduction in our iteration with trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for our tech services business declining to 19.9% down 3 percentage points sequentially and 11 percentage points year-over-year. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. Our quarterly year-over-year revenue decline in the segment reflects the soft market and continuing weakness in discretionary spending. In response, we are transitioning more existing work in the sector towards managed services as many clients remain focused on driving cost takeout, vendor consolidation and productivity initiatives. We also stepping up our engagement with fintech companies which we believe offer a great opportunity for digital transformation. And we are strengthening our capabilities with a goal of capturing discretionary spending on transformation work when it returns. For example, we continue to support the modernization of S&P Global's Configure Prize Quote System to enable end-to-end digitization in what we believe is the world's largest CPQ implementation on Salesforce. And we are collaborating with Max, Life Insurance to launch an innovation and development center in Chennai to help accelerate the digital transformation efforts. With a flexible fine-centric operating model, we can assist clients across industry sectors, takeout costs, consolidate their vendors and achieve both technology and operational efficiencies which provide opportunities for large deals. We can also help them develop digital platforms to deliver richer and more personalized experiences to their customers. What's more, we can engineer technology into their products and services. As an example, we recently extended a partnership with Gilead Sciences. This agreement includes the renewable and expansion of Cognizant services for a total expected value of $800 million over the next five years. We'll manage Gilead's global idea infrastructure while leading digital transformation initiatives designed to enhance their overall client experience and enable faster time to market for the products. We will apply the power of GenAI and Intelligent Automation to help improve Gilead's customer service experience and assist in driving greater manufacturing efficiencies. To support clients' transformation leads, we've established a distinctive position across industry using a platform-centric approach designed to speed clients' consumption of technology. You've seen the emphasis we've given to this platform approach. For example, Cognizant, TriZetto and healthcare are shared investigator platform in life sciences, asset performance excellence in smart manufacturing and Car-to-Cloud in automotive. Last quarter, we launched two new platforms with applications across industries, new royalty operations, which enables AI-led autonomous operations and Cognizant Sky-grade designed to help clients maximize the full potential of cloud. Turning to AI in quarter two, we expanded our platform portfolio further with Cognizant Neuro AI. It's designed to speed the adoption of generative AI and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. With Neuro AI, we are helping clients advance from identifying company-specific use cases to operationalizing AI. I should point out that generative AI is a natural evolution of a work-crossed cognitive AI enterprise applications in data analytics services. To extract value from GenAI, the data must be curated, trained, modernized and made production ready. You also need a deep understanding of clients' data estate, data architectures, data usage patterns, and business applications of the data. Our current approach to leverage third-party foundational models and enhance them with our platforms and IP and then fine tune the models for clients. Today we have more than 100 active client engagements in various stages with the focus on cognitive and generative AI, as well as hundreds more projects using AI services within the context of delivery. We're designing a generative AI offerings for industry-specific solutions, cross-industry use cases in productivity, enablement, under themes like transforming code processes, improving the customer and employee experience, product innovations, software and coding, and knowledge management to name a few. For example, one of the world's largest healthcare product companies, we are helping to speed up the research process by deploying GenAI to author scientific content. We developed a workbench that uses GPT models to summarize and generate content from unstructured and structured data, such as laboratory information management systems with the aim of automating the generation of regulatory content. For a top-20 property and casualty insurer, we have helped frame its GenAI strategy and conduct real-world tests based on company data. For example, we built a GenAI-based digital virtual assistant that analyzed large loss complex claims submissions. By referencing the insurer's claim data, the virtual assistant was able to guide a human claims handler to gather nearly 100% of missing claims information. This simple application is expected to produce millions of dollars in savings through improved operational efficiency and reduced claim costs. In addition, we signed a new multi-year agreement with Nuance Communications, a Microsoft company, to help scale the resources for Nuance's Dragon ambient experience operations. This solution is at the forefront of conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence. Let's turn to the essential role partners play in delivering our AI capabilities. We expanded our alliance with Google Cloud to help enterprise clients create, migrate, and modernize their AI journeys, and offer clients innovative industry solutions founded on the tenet of responsible AI. Our investments in developing GenAI capabilities include launching the Cognizant Google Cloud AI University, a program designed to train 25,000 Cognizant professionals on Google Cloud AI technologies. We'll offer this program to our clients as well. And earlier today, we announced that as a part of our expanded partnership with Google, we'll be building on Google Cloud's Generative AI technology with Cognizant's AI domain expertise to create a healthcare large language model. This LLM is designed to simplify and improve the accuracy of complex healthcare administrative tasks and strengthen business outcomes for healthcare organizations. We've also expanded our relationship with Microsoft to deliver industry solutions and enable AI-led transformation. This includes expanding the focus of our Microsoft Center of Excellence in AI and other next-gen technologies to drive competencies across architecture, technology leadership, value delivery tools, and enablement. Cognizant and ServiceNow have announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. Our industry expertise and solutions integrated with ServiceNow's intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation will bring to market offerings that are designed to solve complex problems, automate operations, and enhance employee as well as end-customer experiences through the use of AI. Now a quick update on our three long-term performance objectives, becoming an employer of choice in our industry, accelerating revenue growth, and enhancing operational discipline. Let's start with the employer of choice. During our Q4 call, I talked about how tightly linked the client and the employee experience are, giving Cognizant the opportunity to create self-reinforcing cycles. Highly engaged talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients, in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. Now, two quarters later, we are seeing the early benefits of this interdependent relationship between employees and clients. Our trailing 12-month voluntary attrition has been trending downwards for the last four quarters. And our just-completed annual people engagement survey showed meaningfully improved engagement results. Among the many questions the survey poses to associates, we saw multipoint increases in three areas strongly correlated to engagement. Would you recommend Cognizant as a great place to work? Are you excited about Cognizant's future? And do you plan to be working at Cognizant two years from now? On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process through the first half of this year shows solid improvement over the previous period scores as well as our best net promoter score since launching this program in 2021. I see us making real progress on creating a self-reinforcing cycle. From day one, my commitment to our associates has been to cultivate a diverse organization that reflects the world in which we operate. Our top priority has been to increase a diverse talent including at leadership levels. I\u2019m delighted to say that in the past couple of months we have appointed 7 women to fill strategic roles at the Senior Vice President level. We are resolved to help all our associates bring their best selves to work and that means focusing on all aspects of their Cognizant experience. For example, we develop talent early through educational partnerships and apprenticeships. We invest heavily in upskilling and reskilling current employees through our award-winning leadership and development ecosystem. We also employ innovative trained to hire initiatives such as the Cognizant's Skills Accelerators aimed at people seeking to kickstart a technology career in the U.S. and the Cognizant internship program for technology professionals looking to restart their careers. Our next priority is to accelerate revenue growth which is the absolute focus of the entire management team. We are differentiating Cognizant and large-deal opportunities by scaling our capabilities for cost take-out and optimization and focusing more on managed services. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities of the cost and efficiency side. Given the groundswell of interest in generative AI, the number of projects we have underway focused on cognitive and generative AI, we see this technology generating a new wave of opportunities for us. Accordingly we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years. Our third long-term priority is to enhance our operational discipline. We are working to fortify a day-to-day business execution and optimize cost of delivery by driving higher productivity powered by advances in tooling platforms and automation technologies and by improving their operational labor in areas like billable utilization. Our NextGen program which we announced last quarter is on track. We are making progress on removing structural costs as we continue to simplify our operating model and reline our office space to the future of hybrid work. Or our last call, I talked about a plan to redistribute some of our development centers from India's largest cities to smaller cities. I'm pleased to announce the first phase of this shift with the planned opening of two new centers, one in Bhubaneswar and the other in Indore India, which offer great talent pools. Keep in mind the next generation next-generation program, over rights, overriding aim is to generate savings to invest in our people and our growth. Yan will provide additional details in his remarks on the next-gen program. In closing, I'm now seven months into my tenure as a CEO. I've met with more than 200 clients, dozens of our partners and through in-person and virtual town halls with most of our workforce. I've also made a point to continuously soliciting ideas and perspectives from our top thousand leaders on strategic topics of importance to our future. Further, a company-wide grassroots innovation movement launched earlier this year, Blue Bolt, has led to such a surge of fresh ideas with more than 32,000 generated so far that it's now serving as a company's innovation engine. I'm convinced Cognizant path to winning in the market place, runs through fully embracing our heritage and DNA. We are leaning into our heritage at the intersection of industry and technology, a flexible client-centric operating model and a distributed delivery network that bring together global and local capabilities. All-in-all, we've been making good progress, but to recognize how much more work lies ahead, continuing to build on our growth imperatives as the goal on which everyone in the company is focused. I especially want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our associates for the extraordinary work they do each day. Before I turn the call to Jan, I want to comment on his plans for the future. Jan let me and the board knows his intention to retire from Cognizant early next year. Jan has been a wonderful business partner to me and over the past three years he's played an instrumental role in designing and executing a strategic financial and operation operating plan while developing superb talent with our finance organization. As we begin the search for the company's next CFO, I'm grateful for Jan's willingness to work closely with his eventual successor to ensure his smooth transition. With that, I turn the call over to him to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I'm proud of what we have accomplished over the last three years, including our work together over the last seven months. I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership in the months ahead while the search for my successor is underway. Until then, it's business as usual, so with that let's turn out to our second quarter results. We delivered second quarter revenue at the high end of our guidance range and adjusted operating margins above expectations. We were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of bookings growth, driven by larger and longer duration deals. Our pipeline for larger bookings also remains strong and is up meaningfully year-over-year. Additionally, our NextGen program is on track and yielding early savings through our efforts to structurally reduce our cost base and fund investments for growth. Moving on to the details of the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of over 1% sequentially and a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year, or roughly flat in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 130 basis points of contribution from our recent acquisitions. Bookings growth in the quarter was again driven by a mixed shift towards larger deals, which had in turn led to longer average duration of our bookings. We are pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and are focused on building momentum in the quarters ahead. Consistent with the first quarter, we have continued to experience softness in smaller, shorter duration contracts, which we attribute to weaker discretionary spending. The translation of bookings to revenue growth is impacted by this change in deal mix. As duration has increased, the conversion to revenue will be longer, but helps to improve our forward visibility. Moving on to segments result for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within financial services, revenues declined 5%, which reflects a softer overall demand environment and weak discretionary spending. As we navigate this environment, we have continued to strengthen our leadership team and sharpen our client engagement. While our pipeline for work related to cost takeout and productivity-led initiatives remains healthy and meaningfully higher than prior year period, we expect the uncertainties of the macro environment to continue to impact the pace of client spending over the next several quarters. Health sciences revenue grew 2%. Growth was again driven by strong demand from healthcare clients for our integrated software solutions, which increased mid-teens year-over-year. While the life sciences was down year-over-year and impacted by softer discretionary spending, we experienced strong sequential growth driven by increased volumes with existing customers. Products and resources revenue grew 4%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, ramp of recent wins, and demand from automotive and travel and hospitality clients. This was partially offset by softer discretionary spending across industries. Communications, media, and technology revenue declined 40 basis points, reflecting softness among both technology and our communications and media clients. We expect growth to improve in Q3 as recent new bookings have already begun to ramp. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue declined 2%, reflecting softness within our financial services and CMT portfolio. This was partially offset by growth in health sciences and products and resources. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside North America, grew approximately 5%. Growth was led by Europe, which grew 6%, and included strong growth within CMT and products and resources, particularly within automotive. Now moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $117 million cost related to our previously announced NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 240 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. Operating margin included the negative impact from an increase in compensation cost, primarily the result of our two merit cycles since October 2022. This has impacted both gross margin and SG&A. This was partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and higher utilization. It also included an approximate 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery related to our previously disclosed 2020 cyber incident. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.1%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.7%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement related to U.S. state income taxes. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 and adjusted EPS was $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion or a net cash of $1.4 billion. DSO of 75 days increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. Free-cash flow in Q2 was a negative $32 million which reflects the previously disclosed impact from the change in the U.S. law that we discussed earlier this year. This change negatively impacted Q2 free cash flow by approximately $420 million which included tax payments of approximately $300 million related to 2022. This impact was largely in line with our expectations and we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income this year. During the quarter we've repurchased about three million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $148 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately six million shares for about $400 million. At quarter end we had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the third quarter we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 0.6% to 1.6% or a decline of 50 basis points to an increase of 50 basis points in current constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of a 110 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year we are reiterating our constant currency revenue growth guidance. Our range is slightly wider than our historical practice reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty and the recent pace of client decision-making. For 2023 we expect revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion representing a decline of 0.9% to a growth of 1.1% or a decline of 1% to growth of 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is still expected to be approximately 100 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance suggests a softer fourth quarter relative to historic norms as we anticipate softer demand and more volatile discretionary spending patterns driven by macroeconomic uncertainty to continue throughout the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, the next-gen program is on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged. However we now expect to incur $350 million in total charges versus $400 million previously. This reflects our assumption for lower employee separation cost as a result of voluntary attrition trend. We now expect to incur approximately $250 million of next-gen cost in 2023 including approximately $100 million relating to employee severance and an unchanged $150 million related to net consolidation of office space. Moving on to adjusted operating margin, our guidance is unchanged at 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors but primarily the negative impact from recent merit cycles. It also reflects our assumption for NextGen savings and growth investments including the dilutive early impact associates with large deals. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million versus $85 million previously reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24% versus 24% to 26% percent previously due to several discrete items in the first half of the year. In 2023 we continue to expect to return approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our regular quarterly dividend. We continue to expect full year average shares outstanding of approximately $506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.48 versus $4.11 to $4.34 previously. With that we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you and good execution in the quarter. I think my first question is with regards to the bookings. If you can provide maybe a little bit more color with regards to the nature of bookings, the nature of discussions with clients, and maybe even any CCD versus ATV balance that you can maybe talk about. Because I think the bigger issue here is not the bookings but the conversion.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Ashwin. This is Ravi here. We had another good quarter of bookings growth, 17% Y&Y. We are excited about -- I've spoken about this before -- there are two swim lanes on large deals. One is related to transformation. One is related to efficiencies, productivity, cost takeout. I think it's fair to say that at this point of time the deals we are seeing in the market are over-indexed to efficiency, cost takeout, consolidation kind of deals. We are excited about the fact that we are starting to win them and translate that into revenues for the future. You would understand that these deals come with a gestation period which is longer than the smaller deals or the transformational deals because of the nature of them. We had five deals more than $100 million TCV in the bookings. Two of them were renewals. One of them had renewals plus expansion. Two of them are net new. So a very healthy mix if I may, of our bookings. The interesting part of doing large deals is you build the rhythm so that even if the period is long enough, as you keep building the rhythm, it will start to contribute to the next year and the next year. I wish I had a big pipe the year before so that it would have contributed this year. So that's how you see it. You have to create that rhythm. Financial services, of course, is less on small deals. Financial services and, for that matter, most of the sectors are muted on discretionary spend on small deals. So that's the color of what we are seeing. We continue to be excited about our ability to win, our ability to also build the organizational infrastructure to execute them, including the productivity gains which we have baked into those deals as we factor them to win and execute. Jan, do you want to add anything?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. So Ashwin to your question of translating all those bookings into revenue, I think intuitively you had already your finger on one of the components of the characteristics of our bookings this quarter, and that's basically, on average, the duration of the deals that we signed up in the last year has very meaningfully lengthened, basically. So we have been signing up longer-term deals, on average, with a higher deal value. We actually saw an absolute decline on smaller deals with lower deals below $5 million in our pipeline and that's softness and discretionary spending and smaller type of deals was just offset by the really excellent performance that we had on the larger deal volume and so that led to the 17% overall booking scope. But with respect to translating into revenue, the actual contribution of this book in volume just to give you an example for the rest of year revenue is actually lower than it was in the comparable quarter. So we really have built a pipeline for longer type of revenue streams in the future, which obviously gives us good comfort into the quality of revenue stream going forward, but it also explains why and we're not seeing immediate uptake on our revenues as these bookings will take time to translate into revenue.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Thank you, that's very useful. This second question on margins, pretty solid performance here and the question with regards to why you might not increase the full year range. I think Jan you answered part of that question in your prepared remarks when you said that there's a ramp cost. I just want to make sure are there other things investments you're making, from a R&D perspective perhaps into GenAI capabilities or things like that, investment payment, are there non-deal related factors also included in your decision to think the margin is unchanged.\nJan Siegmund: Yes, I think the starting point for the market discussion is for the rest of the year, the one thing that's different compared to prior period is that we won't have an October at fourth quarter merit cycle in our in this year, because as you know, we move forward our merit cycle into April. So that's going to be important as you build a quarterly model to consider. Secondly, I use this moment maybe to talk a little bit about the progress we have been making on our next year in the initiative, we have been recording a severance cost in the quarter as well as cost related to the restructuring or real estate portfolio and we're going to start seeing increased impact of the NextGen action relative to our people in the third and fourth quarter, which gives us basically the room to offset some of the pressures that we're seeing, namely some of expected pressure on the large deal rollout and letting those larger deals season in. And I think the general expectation of a given a higher uncertainty in our business environment that will create, I think, it could create some kind of unspecified yet to be seen pressures in our portfolio. We do have seen a number of clients, kind of reacting to their own economic pressure it's reaching out to us. So we do see an economic environment in which they is pressure and so I think it turns out that I think NextGen is well-time to help us through this, but not it would be too early to celebrate basically a false success of that but we're kind of really moving along in the execution of that program gets a bit of confidence to just reaffirm basically that operating marginal  outlook.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Makes sense. Thank you both.\nOperator: Next question, Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Oh, follow up. Maybe first on the GenAI thread and Ravi you commented extensively on what at Cognizant you're doing on GenAI externally with partners and to help clients transform their businesses. Can you comment maybe a little bit more detail on how you are deploying GenAI internally at Cognizant and how you see it over time you know being able to transform your business operations and maybe give you more competitive edge relative to peers. Thank you.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you for that question. I did extensively speak about it because it is in the middle of everything we do in the company today. I see this as three; the GenAI embrace is going to be in three parts. The first part is how do we apply to our business to run our business, which is like eating our own dog food. The second is how do we make sure that we build our operating model, how would by GenAI? How do we make the average developer productivity increase multi-fold? How do we make sure that we build the platform to the instrumentation, the technology we need it. I also call it the ability to arbitrage on technology. I mean over the last 40 or 50 years tech services companies did labour arbitrage and capability arbitrage I would say this is our time to actually do an arbitrage and technology. The more the more instrumentation we create, the more we can make our model efficient enough with productivity gains. The question is how much of the productivity has to be shared with our clients so that we stay competitive to win as well as keep a part of it for us for ourselves. So I'm not as concerned about a smart developer, I'm concerned about an average developer how do I lift the productivity so that the productivity of the organization goes up? So that's my second part of GenAI. We have extensively worked on building those platforms and we also started to partner with a big tech companies. I would say our ability to train in fact we made an announcement with Google to train 25,000 people. We made great progress on it. We ran an initiative with Microsoft on GenAI and the co-pilot initiative. Today along with the earnings we also timed a large language model in partnership with Google. I think that's a step up. I mean, in general way I can, we could use the curation of data, the ability to use, use the model to contextualize to a business. I would say that's the last mile on generative AI. But leveraging our healthcare expertise, leveraging the asset we have and healthcare, the install base we have in healthcare. We potentially thought it's a good board move to actually build a large language model with Google. Now the third part of the mix, before I go to the third part, equally we are starting to think about how do we actually build cognitive skills in the company, which are different to the past. I mean, if generative AI is going to co-exist with humans in tech services, the reality is you read a very different cognitive diversity. We could potentially need people who don't have a stem background because the people who have a stem background engineer those platforms, so the people who come with a cognitive diversity of say human sciences can actually apply generative AI to a client's landscapes. Now coming to the third part of a generative AI story is, how do we actually embrace with our clients. I've actually spoken about a couple of examples in my earnings script, which is starting with a client at financial services. We have one on one on health care. All of those need front-end consultative skills to start with and back in platforms to support it. So our clients, we almost have 100 plus early engagements either on a proof of concept or on prototype model, where we are experimenting on how do we embrace generative AI with our clients. These 100 early engagements in different areas of the most I would say is in customer service. And the most I would say is related to efficiency, productivity and better experience. So I'm excited about all of what we've done. We've also completed $1 billion in the next three years to continue our investments in the space. And we want to stay ahead of the curve and be that cutting edge partner which our clients are looking for.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. And then maybe for my question, my follow-up. I guess thinking about it as I'm being sad about Jan\u2019s departure. But Ravi, maybe back on you know that you've been at Cognizant I guess coming up on a year or so. How are you thinking about kind of shaping the senior executive team at Cognizant? Are there some other kind of senior leaders you would point to that you're bringing in and that you're thinking about finding a replacement for Jan sort of what's the profile and of folks that you're looking at and bringing in given the priority you highlighted about making the Cognizant a top place an employer of choice. Thank you.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you for that question. Jan is going to be with us until we identify a new CFO, and we'll have some overlap period to it, and he's been kind enough to partner with me in the last 7 months. I've not spent a year yet, but in the last 7 months but I'm very hopeful as we finish the transition, I will continue to have his support for the next few quarters. On leadership, per se, we have a very healthy bench. As I put my structure in place, I am excited about promoting and progressing people inside the company and giving them the opportunities. In fact, we have a sizable workforce which has spent more than 7 to 8 years at Cognizant. And I'm actually leading on to build that leadership from inside. We've also -- I'm excited about Cognizant employees coming back to Cognizant. I mean, some of the leadership which left us in the last few years, which we believe are worthwhile and they call Cognizant their home, we have got them back. I have one leader who's come back to do my Industry Solutions Group. I have one leader who has come back to run my infrastructure sales. I'm also excited about other external hires we've done. We've hired a leader for our telecom business. So the excitement of being a part of this journey allows me to straddle between the three, look for people inside the company who can be on that. And I think we have a very good bench of people who have been in the company for a long time, and I'm excited about grooming them to the future leadership. The second is bringing some of the people who want to come back, and we believe that they will add significant value to our future, and of course, the external hiring we could do. In fact, I hired a senior leader for running my partner, organization. So we have made some good progress on putting a leadership team to support us for the future.\nOperator: Next question, Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. So Ravi, wanted to follow up with a demand question here. Just did you get a sense of any real changes in demand KPIs over the past three months? Or would you say it's been largely consistent as it relates to the level of macro and spending uncertainty that you have been conveying here over the course of 2023? And I guess based on these current client conversations, are you getting any sense of how long you anticipate discretionary spending to remain under pressure?\nRavi Kumar: That's a great question, actually. I mean, the demand profile has certainly been very volatile. I mean, if you are capturing opportunities related to discretionary spend, capturing opportunities related to future transformation of enterprise landscapes, it's either been uncertain or it's been kind of, in some places, it has fallen off. And that's one of the reasons why Jan mentioned that smaller deals have -- we have lesser volume of smaller deals and which is true for what the market situation is. Of course, Financial Services is the most impacted but we do see that in other sectors as well. I equally believe it also opens up an opportunity in places to consolidate. It opens up an opportunity to proactively go to our clients who are paranoid about the costs and give them a value proposition which appeals to them where their total cost -- the total cost of ownership goes down but we've been in the process. It's a win-win value proposition. So I'm seeing more of those deals and I'm doubling down on those deals, and that is allowing me to keep the large deal pipeline in good health. And it is an opportunity for us to even proactively go and bid for some of the business. I mean, one of the deals we announced is the Gilead Sciences deal, which is an existing customer. And we not only renewed the contract but we actually got an expansion on it. The key point there is in the past, those consolidation initiatives were run by a smaller productivity attached to technology and a bigger productivity attached to the efficiency of running your labor model, including offshoring, including a better pyramid, including a better roll ratio. I think we have a unique opportunity to switch that into a technology arbitrage which I spoke about, which is using technology to get better productivity and then sharing the benefits to your clients. And that can happen more with consolidation and I think we are trying to seize those opportunities. So I see like these two swim lanes, one which has kind of shrunk and another which is continuing to be in good shape. The idea is to double down on the one which is continuing to have traction so that you could set off against what you're losing on the other side. But discretionary spend is pretty weak. That is something I should highlight.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, okay. Understood. Appreciate all the color. And then just shifting to the workforce. So understanding headcount down quarter-over-quarter a bit more, I think, in the second quarter, but you do have NextGen flowing through there. Just thinking forward in the second half, is it fair to assume this workforce level remains relatively flat to down, just given the optimization in workforce and utilization?\nRavi Kumar: The way I see it is there is opportunity for us to increase billable utilization, and I think there is some more headroom for me to do that. And as I continue to do that, we all want to hit end of a runway on increased utilization. That's when you will see a flip on how you need more headcount to increase billable headcount. So I've said this in my last quarter as well that there was a cushion for us to increase utilization, billable utilization, that also contributed to our margin trajectory a bit. And I think we have some more headroom to increase our operational efficiency to run our business so that we can then get to a point where we then start to increase our net headcount. What also is important is we've also had a good trend of lower attrition. In fact, we ended up with 19.9% on a trailing 12 months, which is 3 percentage points lower than last quarter and almost 11 percentage points lower than Y-on-Y. And as we can keep that down, it will also help us to keep the headcount up. And then as we get to the other end of the NextGen cycle, it will kind of help. So I think we have some headroom for operational efficiency to conduct more billable work before we start to see headcount increase.\nBryan Bergin: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Rayna Kumar with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon. My name is [indiscernible] I'm dialing in for Rayna. I had a question around generative AI. So the benefits of GenAI have been widely discussed but we haven't heard as much about the potential risks. Given that GenAI can potentially improve the internal productivity, do you think there's a risk to the top line over the medium term from like short contract lengths or pricing pressures?\nRavi Kumar: This industry has always had productivity tools. If you go back to the last 20, 25 years, productivity tools have been a way to differentiate, and it has very nicely got baked into our estimation model and then subsequently our execution model. And in addition to labor arbitrage, those productivity tools were the reason why our clients actually came to us because we had capability, we had -- we, of course, had capacity and we had productivity tooling to help them to deliver projects. I would say the advent of automation technologies in the last, I would believe, 5 years or so, including robotic process automation has been a continual embedment into our services. And I want to highlight that the universe we operate in is no longer tech spend of enterprises. The universe we operate in is operations spend of enterprises because technology is deeply embedded into operations. So these tools -- embedding these tools has been -- the industry as well as Cognizant has been very habituated to it. I mean, the ones who do it more are the ones who benefit out of it, and they then bake it into the estimation models. And the estimation models then allow you to stay more competitive than your peers to win business. And then as you win the business, you then keep working on engineering more so that you stay ahead of the curve. GenAI in a way has been a bigger inflection point. It's not different in that continuum but it's a much bigger inflection point. It is a complete game changer. So my belief is, and at least on behalf of Cognizant, I would say, we want to embrace that as much, to make it an opportunity for us for the future. If you don't embrace it, it's going to become a threat for you. If you embrace it and create that technology arbitrage I spoke about, it will allow us to get our clients to partner with us, even get our clients to partner with us at points where our -- at points where they believe that they could in-source. They would potentially outsource because they see us as a unique way to bring productivity to them. So I'm excited about the fact that this is going to be an opportunity. And it's a tectonic shift in the way our operating model will be.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question, Jamie Friedman with SIG. Please go ahead.\nJames Friedman: Hi, I'm just curious as to -- in terms of the environment for the second half, what do you see as the factors that could put you, say, towards the higher or lower end of the guidance, with furloughs contemplated potentially for the fourth quarter?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. We -- well, we try to give guidance that reflects at the midpoint our true expectations of what we achieve. So that's really our core belief. And the elements that we are watching carefully in the next couple of quarters are the scaling of the implementation of a couple of our large contracts that we signed. Those are complex deals that need to be rolled out in partnership with our clients. And that can be just the practicalities of a complex project can give delays or can give you positive news. So that's something that I'm very carefully watching. And certainly, there could be a theoretical path that some of these projects scale a little faster than we anticipated and that would give us some upside. But also in the quarter, we have observed this economic uncertainty hitting us, and you always get also some unanticipated bad news that happens. Certain deals get either canceled or scaled down or less visible, smaller deals just dissipate into nothing. So the general economic environment and the climate of our clients, and Ravi just gave you the assessment, we kind of feel that, that pressure will continue in the second two quarters on discretionary spend. That puts the pressure on it. And so in a sense, it's really a balanced outlook that I have. We are lucky that we are able to add the revenue stream of large deals into our revenue mix compared to our competitors in our market. We didn't have that last year, and so this is a truly incremental opportunity for us. But as everybody, we are facing also with a downward pressure in the rest of our portfolio. So I think the outlook that I gave is a fair and balanced view of the expectations that we have.\nJames Friedman: Okay, thank you for that. And for my follow-up. Jan, that's a great answer. But just wondering could you double click on the assumptions by vertical? I realize you don't guide by vertical but, are at a higher level, any of these contemplated to be above or below the corporate average?\nJan Siegmund: Yes. I think the one that what we're trying to signal in my comments also is that we feel that for the next couple of quarters, we're going to continue to see the pressure in Financial Services performing below our own. I hope, basically, but then the reality of a sector that has shown weakness really, I think, across in our industry. I don't anticipate that to change. And there's some strength, as you saw in the quarter and now have strength on a relative basis in Healthcare. And that reflects our strong market position that we have with our clients in Healthcare. So those would be the two big factors. Those trends are relatively consistent, I think, with what we have seen in the first two quarters of the year.\nJames Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. And Jan, congrats on the retirement news. I want to ask on the booking success, especially on the larger deals you have been talking about here. What changes are working? Is there a way to rank that for us because we get a lot of questions on pricing, of course? Where does pricing rank amongst all the factors with you winning on the larger deal side? And is there any impact here on gross margins for the second half to consider?\nJan Siegmund: I think from my perspective, pricing is definitely a very important factor. All these deals are -- or the vast, vast majority of these deals is competitive and you just have to be in the range of the expectations and meet the clients. And that is kind of table fixed. The commitment that the company brings to the table as we now compete for these large deals, from Ravi at the top to the entire team, from our markets to our integrated service lines is really different and I think has made a difference in winning the deals. Our clients have seen the commitment that we are making and the importance that we are giving to their specific deals just by the, I think, pure exposure and access to our teams and then obviously, the strength of our solutions that we have brought to the table. So it's that whole package that plays into it. I would say these deals that you have seen here in the quarter and really starting in the year, a little bit stronger focused on traditional deals, focusing on cost takeout and some on consolidation, are more classic deals, bread-and-butter type deals, large in nature but that have made the portfolio of those wins. Maybe Ravi, you add a little?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So large deals come with a very different rhythm, right? We have made sure that we have an outreach now to our -- to a chance, I mean, partners, hyperscalers, deal advisories and a whole bunch of players in the mix. The second is our ability to build institutional infrastructure because a lot of deals don't just need the heavy lifting upstream. They need the heavy lifting downstream as well. So that you price them to win but you deliver them to margins. Our ability to put all of that together, I think the company had it before. I have kind of assembled it together and then we have strengthened it further. And our entrepreneurial spirit to go and tell our clients some provocative opportunities, which could create a win-win situation for our clients and us, and therefore, create value for the process, has helped us to create a large deal mindset or a growth mindset. And I'm very confident that, that's now a part of the muscle of the company. So as we continue to invest on deal infrastructure into the market, as well as the mindset to be provocative with your clients and support that bold vision by building downstream infrastructure, organizational infrastructure including the tooling on new age AI-led productivity, that's very important. The deals could be traditional but the levers you press could be relatively new. I mean, the amount of automation infrastructure, the amount of AI infrastructure you could use to actually create straight-through processing and operations kind of work and create higher productivity run, maintain as well as build businesses for our clients, I think, is -- it's a new lever. And I think we -- I'm confident that we are ahead of the curve and therefore, we are competitive in the market to win these deals.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Perfect. Thank you both on the thoughts.\nOperator: We've come to the end of the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you very much, Stacey, and thank you all for joining us tonight. We look forward to catching up with you on our next earnings call. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi, for the kind words. I'm proud of what we have accomplished over the last three years, including our work together over the last seven months. I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership in the months ahead while the search for my successor is underway. Until then, it's business as usual, so with that let's turn out to our second quarter results. We delivered second quarter revenue at the high end of our guidance range and adjusted operating margins above expectations. We were pleased to deliver another strong quarter of bookings growth, driven by larger and longer duration deals. Our pipeline for larger bookings also remains strong and is up meaningfully year-over-year. Additionally, our NextGen program is on track and yielding early savings through our efforts to structurally reduce our cost base and fund investments for growth. Moving on to the details of the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, representing an increase of over 1% sequentially and a decline of 40 basis points year-over-year, or roughly flat in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 130 basis points of contribution from our recent acquisitions. Bookings growth in the quarter was again driven by a mixed shift towards larger deals, which had in turn led to longer average duration of our bookings. We are pleased with our bookings performance in the quarter and are focused on building momentum in the quarters ahead. Consistent with the first quarter, we have continued to experience softness in smaller, shorter duration contracts, which we attribute to weaker discretionary spending. The translation of bookings to revenue growth is impacted by this change in deal mix. As duration has increased, the conversion to revenue will be longer, but helps to improve our forward visibility. Moving on to segments result for the second quarter, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within financial services, revenues declined 5%, which reflects a softer overall demand environment and weak discretionary spending. As we navigate this environment, we have continued to strengthen our leadership team and sharpen our client engagement. While our pipeline for work related to cost takeout and productivity-led initiatives remains healthy and meaningfully higher than prior year period, we expect the uncertainties of the macro environment to continue to impact the pace of client spending over the next several quarters. Health sciences revenue grew 2%. Growth was again driven by strong demand from healthcare clients for our integrated software solutions, which increased mid-teens year-over-year. While the life sciences was down year-over-year and impacted by softer discretionary spending, we experienced strong sequential growth driven by increased volumes with existing customers. Products and resources revenue grew 4%, reflecting the benefit from recently completed acquisitions, ramp of recent wins, and demand from automotive and travel and hospitality clients. This was partially offset by softer discretionary spending across industries. Communications, media, and technology revenue declined 40 basis points, reflecting softness among both technology and our communications and media clients. We expect growth to improve in Q3 as recent new bookings have already begun to ramp. Continuing with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, from a geographic perspective in Q2, North America revenue declined 2%, reflecting softness within our financial services and CMT portfolio. This was partially offset by growth in health sciences and products and resources. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside North America, grew approximately 5%. Growth was led by Europe, which grew 6%, and included strong growth within CMT and products and resources, particularly within automotive. Now moving on to margins. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $117 million cost related to our previously announced NextGen program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 240 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%. Operating margin included the negative impact from an increase in compensation cost, primarily the result of our two merit cycles since October 2022. This has impacted both gross margin and SG&A. This was partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee and higher utilization. It also included an approximate 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery related to our previously disclosed 2020 cyber incident. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.1%. Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21.7%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement related to U.S. state income taxes. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 and adjusted EPS was $1.10. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion or a net cash of $1.4 billion. DSO of 75 days increased two days sequentially and one day year-over-year. Free-cash flow in Q2 was a negative $32 million which reflects the previously disclosed impact from the change in the U.S. law that we discussed earlier this year. This change negatively impacted Q2 free cash flow by approximately $420 million which included tax payments of approximately $300 million related to 2022. This impact was largely in line with our expectations and we continue to expect free cash flow to represent approximately 90% of net income this year. During the quarter we've repurchased about three million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $148 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately six million shares for about $400 million. At quarter end we had $2.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Turning to our forward outlook. For the third quarter we expect revenue in the range of $4.9 billion to $4.94 billion representing a year-over-year increase of 0.6% to 1.6% or a decline of 50 basis points to an increase of 50 basis points in current constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a positive impact of a 110 basis points as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. For the full year we are reiterating our constant currency revenue growth guidance. Our range is slightly wider than our historical practice reflecting a heightened level of uncertainty and the recent pace of client decision-making. For 2023 we expect revenue of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion representing a decline of 0.9% to a growth of 1.1% or a decline of 1% to growth of 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is still expected to be approximately 100 basis points. The midpoint of our guidance suggests a softer fourth quarter relative to historic norms as we anticipate softer demand and more volatile discretionary spending patterns driven by macroeconomic uncertainty to continue throughout the end of the year. As I mentioned earlier, the next-gen program is on track and our assumptions for cost savings are unchanged. However we now expect to incur $350 million in total charges versus $400 million previously. This reflects our assumption for lower employee separation cost as a result of voluntary attrition trend. We now expect to incur approximately $250 million of next-gen cost in 2023 including approximately $100 million relating to employee severance and an unchanged $150 million related to net consolidation of office space. Moving on to adjusted operating margin, our guidance is unchanged at 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors but primarily the negative impact from recent merit cycles. It also reflects our assumption for NextGen savings and growth investments including the dilutive early impact associates with large deals. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $115 million versus $85 million previously reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24% versus 24% to 26% percent previously due to several discrete items in the first half of the year. In 2023 we continue to expect to return approximately $1.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and our regular quarterly dividend. We continue to expect full year average shares outstanding of approximately $506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.25 to $4.48 versus $4.11 to $4.34 previously. With that we will open the call for your questions. Yes. So Ashwin to your question of translating all those bookings into revenue, I think intuitively you had already your finger on one of the components of the characteristics of our bookings this quarter, and that's basically, on average, the duration of the deals that we signed up in the last year has very meaningfully lengthened, basically. So we have been signing up longer-term deals, on average, with a higher deal value. We actually saw an absolute decline on smaller deals with lower deals below $5 million in our pipeline and that's softness and discretionary spending and smaller type of deals was just offset by the really excellent performance that we had on the larger deal volume and so that led to the 17% overall booking scope. But with respect to translating into revenue, the actual contribution of this book in volume just to give you an example for the rest of year revenue is actually lower than it was in the comparable quarter. So we really have built a pipeline for longer type of revenue streams in the future, which obviously gives us good comfort into the quality of revenue stream going forward, but it also explains why and we're not seeing immediate uptake on our revenues as these bookings will take time to translate into revenue. Yes, I think the starting point for the market discussion is for the rest of the year, the one thing that's different compared to prior period is that we won't have an October at fourth quarter merit cycle in our in this year, because as you know, we move forward our merit cycle into April. So that's going to be important as you build a quarterly model to consider. Secondly, I use this moment maybe to talk a little bit about the progress we have been making on our next year in the initiative, we have been recording a severance cost in the quarter as well as cost related to the restructuring or real estate portfolio and we're going to start seeing increased impact of the NextGen action relative to our people in the third and fourth quarter, which gives us basically the room to offset some of the pressures that we're seeing, namely some of expected pressure on the large deal rollout and letting those larger deals season in. And I think the general expectation of a given a higher uncertainty in our business environment that will create, I think, it could create some kind of unspecified yet to be seen pressures in our portfolio. We do have seen a number of clients, kind of reacting to their own economic pressure it's reaching out to us. So we do see an economic environment in which they is pressure and so I think it turns out that I think NextGen is well-time to help us through this, but not it would be too early to celebrate basically a false success of that but we're kind of really moving along in the execution of that program gets a bit of confidence to just reaffirm basically that operating marginal  outlook. Yes. We -- well, we try to give guidance that reflects at the midpoint our true expectations of what we achieve. So that's really our core belief. And the elements that we are watching carefully in the next couple of quarters are the scaling of the implementation of a couple of our large contracts that we signed. Those are complex deals that need to be rolled out in partnership with our clients. And that can be just the practicalities of a complex project can give delays or can give you positive news.

Certain deals get either canceled or scaled down or less visible, smaller deals just dissipate into nothing. So the general economic environment and the climate of our clients, and Ravi just gave you the assessment, we kind of feel that, that pressure will continue in the second two quarters on discretionary spend. That puts the pressure on it. And so in a sense, it's really a balanced outlook that I have. We are lucky that we are able to add the revenue stream of large deals into our revenue mix compared to our competitors in our market. We didn't have that last year, and so this is a truly incremental opportunity for us. But as everybody, we are facing also with a downward pressure in the rest of our portfolio. So I think the outlook that I gave is a fair and balanced view of the expectations that we have. Yes. I think the one that what we're trying to signal in my comments also is that we feel that for the next couple of quarters, we're going to continue to see the pressure in Financial Services performing below our own. I hope, basically, but then the reality of a sector that has shown weakness really, I think, across in our industry. I don't anticipate that to change. And there's some strength, as you saw in the quarter and now have strength on a relative basis in Healthcare. And that reflects our strong market position that we have with our clients in Healthcare. So those would be the two big factors. Those trends are relatively consistent, I think, with what we have seen in the first two quarters of the year.

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to discuss four topics with you today. Our second quarter results, the demand environment of comprehensive commitment to generative AI and an update on our long-term priorities. We made continued progress during the quarter in what remains an uncertain global macroeconomic environment. Q2 came in at $4.9 billion at the high end of our guidance range. We were pleased to return to sequential revenue growth of more than 1%. Year-over-year Q2 revenue showed a modest decline of 40 basis points or essentially flat in constant currency. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.2% and adjusted EPS was $1.10. We recorded another quarter of strong bookings growth 17% year-over-year ending quarter two with record trailing 12-months bookings of $26.4 billion. A book-to-bill of 1.4x approximately 30% of our in quarter Q2 bookings were large deals and five of this deals exceeded $100 million each. Our bookings continue to be a balance mix of renewables, extensions and new opportunities. The leadership team and I remain intensely focused on a talent. So I am glad to see the continued reduction in our iteration with trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for our tech services business declining to 19.9% down 3 percentage points sequentially and 11 percentage points year-over-year. While Jan will cover our performance at a business segment level, I want to offer a quick word about financial services. Our quarterly year-over-year revenue decline in the segment reflects the soft market and continuing weakness in discretionary spending. In response, we are transitioning more existing work in the sector towards managed services as many clients remain focused on driving cost takeout, vendor consolidation and productivity initiatives. We also stepping up our engagement with fintech companies which we believe offer a great opportunity for digital transformation. And we are strengthening our capabilities with a goal of capturing discretionary spending on transformation work when it returns. For example, we continue to support the modernization of S&P Global's Configure Prize Quote System to enable end-to-end digitization in what we believe is the world's largest CPQ implementation on Salesforce. And we are collaborating with Max, Life Insurance to launch an innovation and development center in Chennai to help accelerate the digital transformation efforts. With a flexible fine-centric operating model, we can assist clients across industry sectors, takeout costs, consolidate their vendors and achieve both technology and operational efficiencies which provide opportunities for large deals. We can also help them develop digital platforms to deliver richer and more personalized experiences to their customers. What's more, we can engineer technology into their products and services. As an example, we recently extended a partnership with Gilead Sciences. This agreement includes the renewable and expansion of Cognizant services for a total expected value of $800 million over the next five years. We'll manage Gilead's global idea infrastructure while leading digital transformation initiatives designed to enhance their overall client experience and enable faster time to market for the products. We will apply the power of GenAI and Intelligent Automation to help improve Gilead's customer service experience and assist in driving greater manufacturing efficiencies. To support clients' transformation leads, we've established a distinctive position across industry using a platform-centric approach designed to speed clients' consumption of technology. You've seen the emphasis we've given to this platform approach. For example, Cognizant, TriZetto and healthcare are shared investigator platform in life sciences, asset performance excellence in smart manufacturing and Car-to-Cloud in automotive. Last quarter, we launched two new platforms with applications across industries, new royalty operations, which enables AI-led autonomous operations and Cognizant Sky-grade designed to help clients maximize the full potential of cloud. Turning to AI in quarter two, we expanded our platform portfolio further with Cognizant Neuro AI. It's designed to speed the adoption of generative AI and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. With Neuro AI, we are helping clients advance from identifying company-specific use cases to operationalizing AI. I should point out that generative AI is a natural evolution of a work-crossed cognitive AI enterprise applications in data analytics services. To extract value from GenAI, the data must be curated, trained, modernized and made production ready. You also need a deep understanding of clients' data estate, data architectures, data usage patterns, and business applications of the data. Our current approach to leverage third-party foundational models and enhance them with our platforms and IP and then fine tune the models for clients. Today we have more than 100 active client engagements in various stages with the focus on cognitive and generative AI, as well as hundreds more projects using AI services within the context of delivery. We're designing a generative AI offerings for industry-specific solutions, cross-industry use cases in productivity, enablement, under themes like transforming code processes, improving the customer and employee experience, product innovations, software and coding, and knowledge management to name a few. For example, one of the world's largest healthcare product companies, we are helping to speed up the research process by deploying GenAI to author scientific content. We developed a workbench that uses GPT models to summarize and generate content from unstructured and structured data, such as laboratory information management systems with the aim of automating the generation of regulatory content. For a top-20 property and casualty insurer, we have helped frame its GenAI strategy and conduct real-world tests based on company data. For example, we built a GenAI-based digital virtual assistant that analyzed large loss complex claims submissions. By referencing the insurer's claim data, the virtual assistant was able to guide a human claims handler to gather nearly 100% of missing claims information. This simple application is expected to produce millions of dollars in savings through improved operational efficiency and reduced claim costs. In addition, we signed a new multi-year agreement with Nuance Communications, a Microsoft company, to help scale the resources for Nuance's Dragon ambient experience operations. This solution is at the forefront of conversational AI and ambient clinical intelligence. Let's turn to the essential role partners play in delivering our AI capabilities. We expanded our alliance with Google Cloud to help enterprise clients create, migrate, and modernize their AI journeys, and offer clients innovative industry solutions founded on the tenet of responsible AI. Our investments in developing GenAI capabilities include launching the Cognizant Google Cloud AI University, a program designed to train 25,000 Cognizant professionals on Google Cloud AI technologies. We'll offer this program to our clients as well. And earlier today, we announced that as a part of our expanded partnership with Google, we'll be building on Google Cloud's Generative AI technology with Cognizant's AI domain expertise to create a healthcare large language model. This LLM is designed to simplify and improve the accuracy of complex healthcare administrative tasks and strengthen business outcomes for healthcare organizations. We've also expanded our relationship with Microsoft to deliver industry solutions and enable AI-led transformation. This includes expanding the focus of our Microsoft Center of Excellence in AI and other next-gen technologies to drive competencies across architecture, technology leadership, value delivery tools, and enablement. Cognizant and ServiceNow have announced a strategic partnership to accelerate the adoption of AI-driven automation across industries. Our industry expertise and solutions integrated with ServiceNow's intelligent platform for end-to-end digital transformation will bring to market offerings that are designed to solve complex problems, automate operations, and enhance employee as well as end-customer experiences through the use of AI. Now a quick update on our three long-term performance objectives, becoming an employer of choice in our industry, accelerating revenue growth, and enhancing operational discipline. Let's start with the employer of choice. During our Q4 call, I talked about how tightly linked the client and the employee experience are, giving Cognizant the opportunity to create self-reinforcing cycles. Highly engaged talent with a passion for clients and a growth mindset attract the best clients. These clients, in turn, attract more of the best people, keeping the flywheel turning faster. Now, two quarters later, we are seeing the early benefits of this interdependent relationship between employees and clients. Our trailing 12-month voluntary attrition has been trending downwards for the last four quarters. And our just-completed annual people engagement survey showed meaningfully improved engagement results. Among the many questions the survey poses to associates, we saw multipoint increases in three areas strongly correlated to engagement. Would you recommend Cognizant as a great place to work? Are you excited about Cognizant's future? And do you plan to be working at Cognizant two years from now? On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process through the first half of this year shows solid improvement over the previous period scores as well as our best net promoter score since launching this program in 2021. I see us making real progress on creating a self-reinforcing cycle. From day one, my commitment to our associates has been to cultivate a diverse organization that reflects the world in which we operate. Our top priority has been to increase a diverse talent including at leadership levels. I'm delighted to say that in the past couple of months we have appointed 7 women to fill strategic roles at the Senior Vice President level. We are resolved to help all our associates bring their best selves to work and that means focusing on all aspects of their Cognizant experience. For example, we develop talent early through educational partnerships and apprenticeships. We invest heavily in upskilling and reskilling current employees through our award-winning leadership and development ecosystem. We also employ innovative trained to hire initiatives such as the Cognizant's Skills Accelerators aimed at people seeking to kickstart a technology career in the U.S. and the Cognizant internship program for technology professionals looking to restart their careers. Our next priority is to accelerate revenue growth which is the absolute focus of the entire management team. We are differentiating Cognizant and large-deal opportunities by scaling our capabilities for cost take-out and optimization and focusing more on managed services. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities of the cost and efficiency side. Given the groundswell of interest in generative AI, the number of projects we have underway focused on cognitive and generative AI, we see this technology generating a new wave of opportunities for us. Accordingly we expect to invest approximately $1 billion in our generative AI capabilities over the next three years. Our third long-term priority is to enhance our operational discipline. We are working to fortify a day-to-day business execution and optimize cost of delivery by driving higher productivity powered by advances in tooling platforms and automation technologies and by improving their operational labor in areas like billable utilization. Our NextGen program which we announced last quarter is on track. We are making progress on removing structural costs as we continue to simplify our operating model and reline our office space to the future of hybrid work. Or our last call, I talked about a plan to redistribute some of our development centers from India's largest cities to smaller cities. I'm pleased to announce the first phase of this shift with the planned opening of two new centers, one in Bhubaneswar and the other in Indore India, which offer great talent pools. Keep in mind the next generation next-generation program, over rights, overriding aim is to generate savings to invest in our people and our growth. Yan will provide additional details in his remarks on the next-gen program. In closing, I'm now seven months into my tenure as a CEO. I've met with more than 200 clients, dozens of our partners and through in-person and virtual town halls with most of our workforce. I've also made a point to continuously soliciting ideas and perspectives from our top thousand leaders on strategic topics of importance to our future. Further, a company-wide grassroots innovation movement launched earlier this year, Blue Bolt, has led to such a surge of fresh ideas with more than 32,000 generated so far that it's now serving as a company's innovation engine. I'm convinced Cognizant path to winning in the market place, runs through fully embracing our heritage and DNA. We are leaning into our heritage at the intersection of industry and technology, a flexible client-centric operating model and a distributed delivery network that bring together global and local capabilities. All-in-all, we've been making good progress, but to recognize how much more work lies ahead, continuing to build on our growth imperatives as the goal on which everyone in the company is focused. I especially want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all our associates for the extraordinary work they do each day. Before I turn the call to Jan, I want to comment on his plans for the future. Jan let me and the board knows his intention to retire from Cognizant early next year. Jan has been a wonderful business partner to me and over the past three years he's played an instrumental role in designing and executing a strategic financial and operation operating plan while developing superb talent with our finance organization. As we begin the search for the company's next CFO, I'm grateful for Jan's willingness to work closely with his eventual successor to ensure his smooth transition. With that, I turn the call over to him to provide additional details on the quarter. Thank you. Thank you, Ashwin. This is Ravi here. We had another good quarter of bookings growth, 17% Y&Y. We are excited about -- I've spoken about this before -- there are two swim lanes on large deals. One is related to transformation. One is related to efficiencies, productivity, cost takeout. I think it's fair to say that at this point of time the deals we are seeing in the market are over-indexed to efficiency, cost takeout, consolidation kind of deals. We are excited about the fact that we are starting to win them and translate that into revenues for the future. You would understand that these deals come with a gestation period which is longer than the smaller deals or the transformational deals because of the nature of them. We had five deals more than $100 million TCV in the bookings. Two of them were renewals. One of them had renewals plus expansion. Two of them are net new. So a very healthy mix if I may, of our bookings. The interesting part of doing large deals is you build the rhythm so that even if the period is long enough, as you keep building the rhythm, it will start to contribute to the next year and the next year. I wish I had a big pipe the year before so that it would have contributed this year. So that's how you see it. You have to create that rhythm. Financial services, of course, is less on small deals. Financial services and, for that matter, most of the sectors are muted on discretionary spend on small deals. So that's the color of what we are seeing. We continue to be excited about our ability to win, our ability to also build the organizational infrastructure to execute them, including the productivity gains which we have baked into those deals as we factor them to win and execute. Jan, do you want to add anything? Thank you for that question. I did extensively speak about it because it is in the middle of everything we do in the company today. I see this as three; the GenAI embrace is going to be in three parts. The first part is how do we apply to our business to run our business, which is like eating our own dog food. The second is how do we make sure that we build our operating model, how would by GenAI? How do we make the average developer productivity increase multi-fold? How do we make sure that we build the platform to the instrumentation, the technology we need it. I also call it the ability to arbitrage on technology. I mean over the last 40 or 50 years tech services companies did labour arbitrage and capability arbitrage I would say this is our time to actually do an arbitrage and technology. The more the more instrumentation we create, the more we can make our model efficient enough with productivity gains. The question is how much of the productivity has to be shared with our clients so that we stay competitive to win as well as keep a part of it for us for ourselves. So I'm not as concerned about a smart developer, I'm concerned about an average developer how do I lift the productivity so that the productivity of the organization goes up? So that's my second part of GenAI. We have extensively worked on building those platforms and we also started to partner with a big tech companies. I would say our ability to train in fact we made an announcement with Google to train 25,000 people. We made great progress on it. We ran an initiative with Microsoft on GenAI and the co-pilot initiative. Today along with the earnings we also timed a large language model in partnership with Google. I think that's a step up. I mean, in general way I can, we could use the curation of data, the ability to use, use the model to contextualize to a business. I would say that's the last mile on generative AI. But leveraging our healthcare expertise, leveraging the asset we have and healthcare, the install base we have in healthcare. We potentially thought it's a good board move to actually build a large language model with Google. Now the third part of the mix, before I go to the third part, equally we are starting to think about how do we actually build cognitive skills in the company, which are different to the past. I mean, if generative AI is going to co-exist with humans in tech services, the reality is you read a very different cognitive diversity. We could potentially need people who don't have a stem background because the people who have a stem background engineer those platforms, so the people who come with a cognitive diversity of say human sciences can actually apply generative AI to a client's landscapes. Now coming to the third part of a generative AI story is, how do we actually embrace with our clients. I've actually spoken about a couple of examples in my earnings script, which is starting with a client at financial services. We have one on one on health care. All of those need front-end consultative skills to start with and back in platforms to support it. So our clients, we almost have 100 plus early engagements either on a proof of concept or on prototype model, where we are experimenting on how do we embrace generative AI with our clients. These 100 early engagements in different areas of the most I would say is in customer service. And the most I would say is related to efficiency, productivity and better experience. So I'm excited about all of what we've done. We've also completed $1 billion in the next three years to continue our investments in the space. And we want to stay ahead of the curve and be that cutting edge partner which our clients are looking for. Thank you for that question. Jan is going to be with us until we identify a new CFO, and we'll have some overlap period to it, and he's been kind enough to partner with me in the last 7 months. I've not spent a year yet, but in the last 7 months but I'm very hopeful as we finish the transition, I will continue to have his support for the next few quarters. On leadership, per se, we have a very healthy bench. As I put my structure in place, I am excited about promoting and progressing people inside the company and giving them the opportunities. In fact, we have a sizable workforce which has spent more than 7 to 8 years at Cognizant. And I'm actually leading on to build that leadership from inside. We've also -- I'm excited about Cognizant employees coming back to Cognizant. I mean, some of the leadership which left us in the last few years, which we believe are worthwhile and they call Cognizant their home, we have got them back. I have one leader who's come back to do my Industry Solutions Group. I have one leader who has come back to run my infrastructure sales. I'm also excited about other external hires we've done. We've hired a leader for our telecom business. So the excitement of being a part of this journey allows me to straddle between the three, look for people inside the company who can be on that. And I think we have a very good bench of people who have been in the company for a long time, and I'm excited about grooming them to the future leadership. The second is bringing some of the people who want to come back, and we believe that they will add significant value to our future, and of course, the external hiring we could do. In fact, I hired a senior leader for running my partner, organization. So we have made some good progress on putting a leadership team to support us for the future. That's a great question, actually. I mean, the demand profile has certainly been very volatile. I mean, if you are capturing opportunities related to discretionary spend, capturing opportunities related to future transformation of enterprise landscapes, it's either been uncertain or it's been kind of, in some places, it has fallen off. And that's one of the reasons why Jan mentioned that smaller deals have -- we have lesser volume of smaller deals and which is true for what the market situation is. Of course, Financial Services is the most impacted but we do see that in other sectors as well. I equally believe it also opens up an opportunity in places to consolidate. It opens up an opportunity to proactively go to our clients who are paranoid about the costs and give them a value proposition which appeals to them where their total cost -- the total cost of ownership goes down but we've been in the process. It's a win-win value proposition. So I'm seeing more of those deals and I'm doubling down on those deals, and that is allowing me to keep the large deal pipeline in good health. And it is an opportunity for us to even proactively go and bid for some of the business. I mean, one of the deals we announced is the Gilead Sciences deal, which is an existing customer. And we not only renewed the contract but we actually got an expansion on it. The key point there is in the past, those consolidation initiatives were run by a smaller productivity attached to technology and a bigger productivity attached to the efficiency of running your labor model, including offshoring, including a better pyramid, including a better roll ratio. I think we have a unique opportunity to switch that into a technology arbitrage which I spoke about, which is using technology to get better productivity and then sharing the benefits to your clients. And that can happen more with consolidation and I think we are trying to seize those opportunities. So I see like these two swim lanes, one which has kind of shrunk and another which is continuing to be in good shape. The idea is to double down on the one which is continuing to have traction so that you could set off against what you're losing on the other side. But discretionary spend is pretty weak. That is something I should highlight. The way I see it is there is opportunity for us to increase billable utilization, and I think there is some more headroom for me to do that. And as I continue to do that, we all want to hit end of a runway on increased utilization. That's when you will see a flip on how you need more headcount to increase billable headcount. So I've said this in my last quarter as well that there was a cushion for us to increase utilization, billable utilization, that also contributed to our margin trajectory a bit. And I think we have some more headroom to increase our operational efficiency to run our business so that we can then get to a point where we then start to increase our net headcount. What also is important is we've also had a good trend of lower attrition. In fact, we ended up with 19.9% on a trailing 12 months, which is 3 percentage points lower than last quarter and almost 11 percentage points lower than Y-on-Y. And as we can keep that down, it will also help us to keep the headcount up. And then as we get to the other end of the NextGen cycle, it will kind of help. So I think we have some headroom for operational efficiency to conduct more billable work before we start to see headcount increase. This industry has always had productivity tools. If you go back to the last 20, 25 years, productivity tools have been a way to differentiate, and it has very nicely got baked into our estimation model and then subsequently our execution model. And in addition to labor arbitrage, those productivity tools were the reason why our clients actually came to us because we had capability, we had -- we, of course, had capacity and we had productivity tooling to help them to deliver projects. I would say the advent of automation technologies in the last, I would believe, 5 years or so, including robotic process automation has been a continual embedment into our services. And I want to highlight that the universe we operate in is no longer tech spend of enterprises. The universe we operate in is operations spend of enterprises because technology is deeply embedded into operations. So these tools -- embedding these tools has been -- the industry as well as Cognizant has been very habituated to it. I mean, the ones who do it more are the ones who benefit out of it, and they then bake it into the estimation models. And the estimation models then allow you to stay more competitive than your peers to win business. And then as you win the business, you then keep working on engineering more so that you stay ahead of the curve. GenAI in a way has been a bigger inflection point. It's not different in that continuum but it's a much bigger inflection point. It is a complete game changer. So my belief is, and at least on behalf of Cognizant, I would say, we want to embrace that as much, to make it an opportunity for us for the future. If you don't embrace it, it's going to become a threat for you. If you embrace it and create that technology arbitrage I spoke about, it will allow us to get our clients to partner with us, even get our clients to partner with us at points where our -- at points where they believe that they could in-source. They would potentially outsource because they see us as a unique way to bring productivity to them. So I'm excited about the fact that this is going to be an opportunity. And it's a tectonic shift in the way our operating model will be. Yes. So large deals come with a very different rhythm, right? We have made sure that we have an outreach now to our -- to a chance, I mean, partners, hyperscalers, deal advisories and a whole bunch of players in the mix. The second is our ability to build institutional infrastructure because a lot of deals don't just need the heavy lifting upstream. They need the heavy lifting downstream as well. So that you price them to win but you deliver them to margins. Our ability to put all of that together, I think the company had it before. I have kind of assembled it together and then we have strengthened it further. And our entrepreneurial spirit to go and tell our clients some provocative opportunities, which could create a win-win situation for our clients and us, and therefore, create value for the process, has helped us to create a large deal mindset or a growth mindset. And I'm very confident that, that's now a part of the muscle of the company. So as we continue to invest on deal infrastructure into the market, as well as the mindset to be provocative with your clients and support that bold vision by building downstream infrastructure, organizational infrastructure including the tooling on new age AI-led productivity, that's very important. The deals could be traditional but the levers you press could be relatively new. I mean, the amount of automation infrastructure, the amount of AI infrastructure you could use to actually create straight-through processing and operations kind of work and create higher productivity run, maintain as well as build businesses for our clients, I think, is -- it's a new lever. And I think we -- I'm confident that we are ahead of the curve and therefore, we are competitive in the market to win these deals."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company\u2019s first quarter 2023 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today\u2019s call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today\u2019s call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the SEC. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke to you early February, I was just 3 weeks into my role. I explained my plan to move rapidly up the learning curve by embarking on a global listening and learning tour with associates, clients and partners. I also mentioned that I would meet with more than 100 clients and as many of our associates as possible. In addition, I outlined three interrelated priorities: making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; accelerate revenue growth, especially by winning large deals; and enhancing our operational discipline. I will comment on progress of each of these areas, but first, I want to cover a few of the quarter\u2019s financial and operational highlights. In quarter one, we delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, a decline of 0.3% year-over-year as reported, but a growth of 1.5% in constant currency, above the high-end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%. We recorded strong quarterly bookings growth of 28% year-over-year and ended quarter one with record trailing 12 months bookings of $25.6 billion in the trailing 12 months book-to-bill of 1.3x. Approximately, 30% of our in-quarter or quarter one bookings were large deals, which we define as total contract value of about $50 million compared to approximately 20% for all of 2022. We were very pleased with our first quarter bookings performance as well as the build in our pipeline, which includes a strong mix of large new opportunities. I am especially pleased to see the continuing reduction in our attrition with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business declining to 23%, down 3% points sequentially and 7 points Y-on-Y year-on-year. While Jan will cover our financial performance at the business segment level, given the importance of financial services on our momentum, I want to comment on the state of this business and the emerging opportunities we see in this segment. For starters, we believe our company-specific operational challenges in financial services have largely subsided and we are beginning to stabilize the business. Our client portfolio has shown resilience, both in U.S. and internationally, but we are also seeing the impact from softer discretionary spending and decision delays by existing and potential clients. In the U.S., our banking clients are generally large institutions, and we have seen an uptick in our deal pipeline. Overall, we have seen early green shoots that we are moving this portfolio in the right direction while navigating the macro dynamics. We are encouraged by leading indicators such as strong Q1 global bookings growth for financial services at a rate above the company average as well as an uptick in our large deal pipeline. I am particularly encouraged by my conversations with about two dozen of our financial services clients. I came away from these meetings with many new opportunities to pursue related to cost takeout, vendor consolidation, post-merger integration and a new wave of outsourcing in fintechs. Having said that, we still have a lot of work ahead, and we will be closely monitoring the environment to anticipate shifts in our clients\u2019 needs. To-date, I have met either in person or virtually with C-suite executors from more than 100 of our clients representing nearly all of our industry segments and all of our major geographies. Several teams have surfaced from these candid conversations. We have a strong goodwill with our clients and continue to recognize a culture of client centricity. This way, we are easy to work with, attentive to nurturing our client relationships and deeply understand their businesses. They like our entrepreneurial approach to developing solutions to their challenges. They also appreciate our humility, our willingness to learn, listen and adapt. I believe the longevity and depth of our relationships have created a lot of accumulated trust. By the way, none of our clients I spoke to mentioned about Cognizant\u2019s digital mix. I believe that\u2019s because digital and non-digital capabilities have converged to the point where the distinction between the two is less significant. Instead, the differentiator many clients have spoken about is how well positioned Cognizant is that the confluence of technology and industry domains. Given that our digital mix is no longer a true measure of the value we are providing to clients, we have decided to stop disclosing this metric. With that said, clients want more from us. They trust us with their agenda, strategies and competitive challenges. They tell me Cognizant has earned the right to challenge their thinking and be a strategic partner who co-create solutions with them and offers insights on improving their operations. Overall, I came away with the sense that many clients are fans of our company. What also surfaced is that most clients are grappling with largely similar challenges, although with variations by industry. The cost basis reflect the higher growth levels seen during the pandemic era, prompting an intensified focus on optimizing cost and efficiency and building greater resilience. They need to digitize workflows, enhance their customer and employee experiences and boost the efficiency of their commercial and operational teams. In that context, I thought it would be useful to mention a few recent client wins that underscore the strategic cloud-focused work we do for clients and a skill-as-a-systems integrator. We are partnering with Microsoft to build an integration roadmap between our TriZetto health products and the cloud for healthcare. Our shared aim is to give payers and providers easy access to cutting-edge technology solutions, streamlined claims management and improved interoperability to deliver better patient and member experiences. In a new win, we are working with Boehringer Ingelheim to speed the development and improve the accuracy of their life-saving therapies. We help our clients unify medicinal development processes and data into unified cloud platform and enhance the collaboration across clinical, regulatory and quality functions. We\u2019ve been engaged by works within Group Ireland to reengineer its siloed contact center platform into omnichannel customer service landscape that will deliver more personalized agent and customer experiences using Salesforce Cloud and Amazon Connect. And last week, we announced a new 5-year agreement to transform and support the global technology operations of a long-term client, Nike. We will help drive customer, employee and partner experiences from Nike by leveraging hyper-automation, AI and processing reengineering. These are just a few examples. In short, our capabilities are in demand as clients navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Let\u2019s turn to the company\u2019s three focus areas of growth enablers and the progress we are beginning to make. The first of these is to become an employer of choice. We recognize this as a multiyear undertaking. To take the pulse of employee sentiment, I\u2019ve been using every communication channel available to get unfiltered feedback from tens of thousands of associates to learn what\u2019s what needs to improve. As a part of my immersion, I spent 2 weeks in India visiting a half a dozen cities where we have major facilities, along with traveling to see associates in the UK, Switzerland, Canada and across the U.S. I\u2019ve been moved by our associates warmth, enthusiasm and energy, and what I am hearing from them is very encouraging. In this post-pandemic era, we are back to walking the corridors for clients, mining relationships and building new ones, and we\u2019re revitalizing our ability to land and expand within existing clients as we steadily bring on new accounts. Across the organization, I see a rising pride in the company. Associates at all levels of our company want to partner with me to begin writing the next chapter in Cognizant\u2019s nearly 30-year history and are moving forward with renewed confidence about the future. To be an employer of choice, we need to meet the demands of a diverse workforce that spans geographies, generation and the range of work and life priorities. Here are a few of our approaches. We have made career progression easier by expanding our internal job board process and redesigning the promotion process to increase more movement across our organization. We have intensified our focus on continuous upscaling and learning by expanding a learning library, running internal learning and development campaigns and launching a new leadership training initiative for people at all levels. We have had three merit increases in 18 months for the majority of our associates who are in the levels up to associate director. And over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve invested significantly more in compensation. In addition, we are stepping up the efforts to get our associates to return to office because doing so, we believe, helps build and sustain our culture and helps associates build their social capital with colleagues. To tap into the creativity of our more than 350,000 associates, we are launching a grassroots innovation movement because I believe innovative ideas can come from everyone. This program called Blue Bold encourages and celebrates the thousands of flashes of inspiration that our associates have every day as they innovate for our clients. Over the coming months, we plan to train more than 20,000 additional project leads in our innovation methods and generate over 100,000 ideas for client to use rapid prototyping and the identification of new opportunities. A second focus area I\u2019ve spoken about is accelerating revenue growth and building commercial momentum, especially by strengthening our ability to win large deals. Our Q1 bookings were a balance of renewals, expansions and new engagements, which we believe will provide revenue opportunities for us later in the year and valid to 2024. Our strong bookings growth in the quarter, including four deals with a total contract value of about $100 million. To cite one large deal, one recent large deal, Horizon Healthcare Services selected us to manage their claims processing and counter submissions to the state and enrollment services for their 1.2 million members. In the 7-year renewal agreement, we will bring to bear advanced automation solutions for our TriZetto product suite to help Horizon expedite the claims payment process and ensure accuracy in support of their member services. Our large deal pipeline remains healthy for the next couple of quarters. Large deal bookings that aligned with our risk appetite are essential to building commercial momentum, but they can take time to ramp up and realize revenue. We are working on strengthening and industrializing delivery to support our execution of large deals. Moving to our third priority, operational excellence. As you may recall from my last call, I said that internal simplification would be a team will carry forward to help achieve the company\u2019s full potential. Our drive for simplification will include operating with fewer layers to deliver greater agility along with realigning the business to be closer to our clients and employees, and of course, to increase a growth mindset. This endeavor named NextGen is aimed at building the enterprise of the future by simplifying our business operations, optimizing our corporate functions and realigning our workforce to a post-pandemic era of hybrid and redistributed work. This shift will provide an opportunity to rationalize the workspaces across the world and especially in India\u2019s largest cities where we\u2019re distributing some real estate to smaller cities where we can expand and by modernizing some existing space. We expect the structural shift in our real estate costs to help eliminate 80,000 seats and 11 million square feet in large cities in India. This shift will also enable us to invest in collaboration spaces in smaller cities while creating structural savings for the future that we can invest in our people and growth opportunities. We expect this program to help enable us to deliver margin expansion in the range of 20 to 40 basis points in 2024 while supporting a large deal pipeline. Combined with our efforts to increase utilization, improve delivery efficiency, maintain disciplined pricing and a lower attrition, we believe we have the levers to drive modest margin expansion over the next several years while we continue to fund growth investments in 2024 and beyond. Recognizing how much work we have ahead of us, I plan to provide periodic updates about our progress in achieving these three priorities. Let\u2019s spend a moment on the demand environment and tech trends. We are carefully monitoring what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment and with its potential for shifts in client priorities. That said, we are optimistic about our long-term opportunity within the IT services market. The demand for solutions and business outcomes remain solid as technology becomes core to nearly every business. The tech trend on everyone\u2019s mind is generative AI with recent breakthroughs offering the potential to fundamentally transform our clients\u2019 businesses and increase our own productivity. To that end, we are accelerating our investment in generative AI. Our AI accelerator process uses studio environments to collaborate with clients to identify priority AI use cases and rapidly implement prototype solutions for field testing. We have conducted ideation sessions with over 30 clients and are now working to industrialize solutions to their common challenges. We believe generative AI will revolutionize the technology services industry, creating higher rates of productivity and driving greater prominence for software and data engineering expertise. We are using AI to enhance our own creativity and productivity. We are operating pilots that use generative AI to accelerate consulting, design, engineering and operations with the long-term goal of doubling the productivity of our associates. With that in mind, last month, we launched a neuro IT operations, a next-generation platform that brings new levels of automation and intelligence to applications and infrastructure operations. By applying an AI-led automation-first approach, we are enabling enterprises to innovate faster and drive down cost and risk. We believe that enacting new IT operations can actually reduce operational costs by 25% to 45%, reduce mean time to delivery and mean time to detect by 30% to 50% and reduce FTEs by 15% to 30% compared with the use of traditional approaches. Across every industry, the cloud is today the biggest transformational opportunity, and therefore, our clients need a partner that can orchestrate cloud in a heterogeneous environment. In response, we just introduced a new cloud platform called Cognizant Skygrade. This multi-hybrid cloud and edge management platform applies an industry-focused approach designed to help clients transition to a modern cloud-native architecture, develop modern applications that evolve with the pace of business and streamline the cloud management operations. With Skygrade, we believe we can accelerate migration and modernization programs by shortening transformation time by 20% to 40%, resulting in faster value realization while reducing ongoing run and governance costs by 15% to 25%. To wrap up, I stand behind my initial assessment that Cognizant has the strong foundation in place on which we could accelerate growth. I am especially optimistic about the strength of our portfolio and partner ecosystem, combined with our ability to create value for our clients at the intersection of technology and industry use cases. We recognize that our renewed strength in bookings momentum is helping us replenish a softer backlog from the past 9 months, and we believe we can demonstrate improved growth towards the end of this year and in 2024. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2023. Jan, over to you.\nJan Siegmund: Thank you, Ravi, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I touch on the details of the first quarter, I would like to spend a moment on the NextGen program we announced today. During the second quarter, we initiated NexGen to simplify our operating model, optimize our corporate functions and realign our office space to reflect our hybrid work environment. We expect to record total estimated NexGen costs of $400 million, approximately $350 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. This consists of $200 million of employee severance and other costs primarily related to non-billable and corporate personnel which we expect to mostly incur in 2023. The personnel-related actions under this program are expected to impact approximately 3,500 associates or approximately 1% of our total workforce. We expect to realize savings from our NexGen initiative in the back half of this year. The NexGen program also includes $200 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space and approximately $150 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. We do not anticipate these real estate actions will begin to generate savings until 2024. By 2025, we expect to reduce our annual real estate costs by approximately $100 million versus 2022. This reduction is net of investments to expand our real estate footprint in smaller cities, primarily in India, in support of our hybrid work strategy. Our full year operating margin outlook includes the anticipated impact of these actions. As Ravi mentioned, we expect this program to help enable us to deliver 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion in 2024, in addition to funding revenue growth opportunities. This 2024 expectation assumes no further deterioration of the economic environment. Beyond 2024, we are focused on driving structural cost improvements to fund investments to support revenue growth, our people and modernization of facilities while driving consistent, modest margin expansion. Now moving on to the details for the quarter. We were pleased to deliver revenue above the high end of our guidance range, strong free cash flow and healthy large deal bookings, which has helped us to begin to replenish our backlog following muted bookings growth throughout 2022. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 30 basis points year-over-year or growth of plus 1.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the first quarter, including the mix shift towards larger deals. We also exited the quarter with a strong pipeline of larger opportunities across industries. At the same time, we also saw pressure in smaller contracts, which we believe is a result of a softer discretionary spending being driven by the macro environment. This environment has a near-term impact on our revenue in the second quarter, which I will touch on in my guidance commentary. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1%. Revenue pressure within our North American portfolio was partially offset by growth in our global growth public sector and insurance clients. In the first quarter, bookings growth within financial services outpaced the total company, and we are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities over the next 12 months. While we have begun to see signs of stabilization, we are still rebuilding our backlog as we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment. We believe this uncertainty has impacted the pace of client decision-making and put pressure on discretionary budgets. It has also resulted in new pipeline opportunities around cost savings, efficiency and vendor consolidation which we are actively pursuing. Health Sciences revenue grew 4%, consistent with last quarter. Growth was driven by increased demand from health care payer clients for our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue grew 1%, reflecting inorganic contribution from recently completed acquisitions and continued strength among logistics, utility and travel and hospitality customers. This was partially offset by pressure from retail, consumer goods and manufacturing customers, which we believe reflects the economic environment. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 4%, reflecting slower growth among our largest technology clients and muted growth among communications and media clients. Similar to our other segments, we believe the macroeconomic environment pace of decision-making and discretionary spending among our CMT clients. Continuing with our year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q1, North America revenue declined 1%. This performance reflected declines within Financial Services and Products and Resources, partially offset by growth in Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 7%. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 14% and included strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients and CMT. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, both our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.6% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margin declined by 40 basis points. This primarily reflects gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs, partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, lower SG&A expenses and the benefit of 2022 pricing actions. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement of prior year tax audits. Year 1, diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and adjusted EPS was $1.11, up 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.8 billion. DSO of 73 days was down 1 day sequentially and increased 1 day year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q1 was $631 million, representing approximately 110% of net income. This compares to free cash flow of $186 million in the prior year period, which represented approximately 35% of net income. The increase in free cash flow was driven by strong collections. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $150 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. We also closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Mobica, which helps bolster our IoT software engineering capabilities; and the professional and application management services business of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner. Over the last 6 months, we have deployed approximately $800 million of capital across 4 acquisitions. Before we move to our outlook, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the change in our attrition disclosure. As you heard Ravi mentioned, we are now disclosing voluntary attrition tech services on a trailing 12-month basis, which we believe is most relevant to our business. This new metric includes all employees, except those in our intuitive operations automation practice, and replaces our prior disclosure. Now turning to our forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.83 billion to $4.88 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.6% to minus 0.6%, or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 60 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We are also providing initial full year 2023 revenue and operating margin guidance. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue to replenish our backlog to successive quarters of strong bookings performance, which we believe would improve revenue momentum towards the end of this year and as we enter 2024. For the full year, we are guiding revenue in the range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a decline of minus 1.2% to growth of plus 0.8%, or a decline of minus 1% to growth of plus 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be approximately 100 basis points. This assumes no major deterioration in the demand environment, and our assumption that large deals we have signed and expect to sign in Q2 begin to ramp more meaningfully in the second half of the year. Moving on to the adjusted operating margin. We are guiding operating margin to be in the range of 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors. First, we expect the macroeconomic environment will impact pricing, which was a key lever for us in 2022 to help offset the elevated wage inflation. Second, we are achieving a faster pace of large deals than we initially anticipated. These larger deals generally have a dilutive impact in the first year. Finally, as mentioned, the NextGen program is not expected to drive meaningful savings until the back half of this year. For real estate, we anticipate initial savings in 2024 and a full run rate in 2025. Our operating margin guidance also assumes a sequential decline in Q2 as a result of the merit cycle that took effect from April 1. As a reminder, this is our second merit cycle for the majority of our employees in the last 6 months. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $85 million, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, and an adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. In 2023, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million on share repurchases, including the activity in Q1. This assumes repurchase activity above our long-term capital allocation framework and will reduce our weighted average share count by approximately 2.5% in 2023. Based on the share repurchase activity, we anticipate full year average shares outstanding of approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.11 to $4.34, which reflects our wider-than-typical operating margin guidance. Finally, we are targeting free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% of net income, which assumes the negative impact from the changes in the U.S. tax law that we discussed in February. We now estimate the negative year-over-year impact of $540 million from this change, which is slightly down from our prior estimate. This includes approximately $300 million in deferred payments relating to 2022. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks for taking my question. Good nice uptick here on the bookings side. I just wanted to talk about this dynamic a little bit. I mean you understand it a little bit more. Is it something that has been a little bit of a struggle with Cognizant over the last few years. You\u2019re showing 9%, I think, bookings growth year-on-year, but that was a book-to-bill of like 1.3x, which is \u2013 implies a bit of a disconnect in sort of how bookings translate to revenues. Can you just talk a little bit \u2013 I know you mentioned you\u2019re refilling the backlog and you\u2019re expecting to come in later in the year. Can you just help us a little bit again with how we should think about that dynamic, the translation of bookings into revenue and the timing and maybe what\u2019s going on with the backlog or with the underlying base of revenue? Thank you.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Lisa. I\u2019m going to \u2013 this is Ravi here. I\u2019m going to start off and then ask Jan to add. We recorded very strong bookings, 28% year-on-year and 12-month trailing bookings of $25.6 billion. And you\u2019re right, book-to-bill ratio is at 1.3x. I think the way to see it is it has multiple factors associated with it. First and foremost, how much of it is renewable? How much of it is new? How much of it is expansion? While we don\u2019t give those numbers out, we had healthy expansion and new business in comparison to the past. We had four large deals more than total contract value of $100 million. Just to give you an order of magnitude. Last year, same quarter, we did not have any large deals. Large deals come with a little bit of \u2013 it comes with a runway where a lot of it is at the end of the cycle or rather at the back of the cycle. Short deals, small deals come with immediate short-fuse demand, which gives you revenue on the short run. Large deals give you revenue on the medium to long run, while in the short run, they take a little time to ramp up. So in summary, how this translates to revenue in the short and the medium and the long run is dependent on what percentage of it is large deals, what percentage of it is small deals. You would appreciate small deals are actually a little softer for us because we\u2019ve \u2013 we know that the discretionary spend is softening in an economic environment we are in. So the large deals gives us the opportunity to accrue revenues at the back end of this year and the next year while we build the pipe for the future. Our pipeline is looking strong as well.\nJan Siegmund: Yes. Lisa, the 9% trailing 12 months bookings growth is really entirely driven by the very strong bookings growth in the quarter. In this quarter, as you know, we had three quarters of flat bookings that contributed to this overall trailing 12-month result. And so the revenue growth, in this case, will be picking up. We expect a model in our revenue guidance, some revenue impact from these larger deals picking and starting and ramping up in the second quarter \u2013 in the second half of this fiscal year and then have a full year impact next year. So for the second quarter, impacting our guidance is also the anticipation that we see softness in the small-scale bookings. So the second quarter, in a sense, it\u2019s kind of a transition quarter, I would say, because we have the high bookings growth, hopefully, continued momentum in bookings as we go through the year. But we do have a short-term revenue impact from the decline of these shorter and smaller deals that are impacted by the economy, by discretionary spend. So that\u2019s kind of how I think best to understand the relationship between bookings and revenue growth.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. And then maybe for my follow-up. Ravi, this one is for you. I know you mentioned you\u2019ve been out talking to 100-plus clients and have now been at Cognizant for 3.5 months or so. Can you just articulate, when you\u2019re talking out there with clients, how you see Cognizant, like, really uniquely differentiated in the market when you\u2019re \u2013 with what you\u2019re hearing back from them, what you\u2019re hearing from associates, etcetera?\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Lisa. I\u2019ve met more than 100 clients in my first 100 days across all geographies, and traveled extensively to meet them and my associates. I would say, just to keep the high-level observations, I think our clients love the confluence of technology and industry demand which Cognizant really comes with. Cognizant, if you go back to the history of Cognizant, it was bought at a time when there was a tail end of the ride to cable, and it was born to be application outsourcing wave, which was starting off. And Cognizant built the capability on a confluence of industry and domain. And industry and domain, the confluence is very important now than ever before because we all know that we are living in a golden era of technology where the core of every business in every industry is transitioning to a technology-led core or a technology must core. So I would say we have to progressively make sure that the confluence of technology and industry, we actually demonstrate the differentiation in every industry we represent. Our biggest exposure is healthcare, life sciences, financial services, which is where I think we have really doubled down on this confluence and we now have to progressively build in every other industry. The second piece, I would say, is client centricity. I think over the years, Cognizant\u2019s growth has actually come from mining accounts with the breadth of capability Cognizant brings. And of course, the entrepreneur spirit of our teams. These are the three things which stood out for me. And in fact, some clients actually who have worked with us for very long, actually said we are fans of Cognizant. I mentioned that on my initial remarks. And that was \u2013 that really stuck to me that these are clients who want us to move with them, who want us to challenge them and to want us to co-create along with them for their technology future, if \u2013 in \u2013 So there can never be a better time for the confluence of technology and industry, and I think we are so well positioned for that.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. My first one is a margin, and I guess, a NextGen program clarification. And sorry if I missed this, but can you give us a sense of what the run rate cost reduction or the net savings you expect to achieve by the end of 2024? And I\u2019m trying to understand if the 20 to 40 bps of \u201824 operating margin is incremental to what you would normally had planned for? Or if that\u2019s kind of the total level of operating margin expansion, which would align with prior targets?\nJan Siegmund: Yes, Bryan, there is many moving parts here. So let me talk first about the overall program of $400 million of restructuring charges, of which $200 million comes from severance and $200 million comes from real estate. We provided really only an expected run rate savings rate to materialize in \u201825 at the full range of $100 million for the real estate component. We offer that savings opportunity because we feel it\u2019s hard from the outside to calculate of how restructuring charges in the real estate space translate actually into full run rate savings. So that\u2019s kind of we wanted to help you with the impact of the $200 million component for real estate with that. A portion of that, a meaningful portion of that will be achieved in \u201824 and then the full run rate in \u201825. On the severance, we haven\u2019t given you a net impact or a gross impact. Number one, I think you can fairly easily calculate by the number of employees affected in the severance volume that we anticipate and make an assumption about the cost savings that we would see. There are many factors, and you\u2019d see this reflected in a relatively wide range of margin that we gave for the year is wage inflation there is an uncertain pricing environment and other things that we will have to manage through. So we haven\u2019t given more detail about the $200 million severance charge at this point in time. For \u201824, the 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion would be off the exit rate in \u201823, and that would be our current outlook to \u201824. It should signal from our point of view, our confidence that the full run rate of this program will help us to not only offset large deal pressure that we\u2019re going to see for this first year business cases of the larger deals plus the wage inflation or other elements for \u201824. So it\u2019s a little unusual that we give that early in expectation on the margin. But we felt, given that the program is fairly sizable and only a portion it is going to be realized in \u201823, it will be helpful for you to know that we are confident about return to margin expansion in \u201824.\nRavi Kumar: Just adding one additional thing out here. I think these are two structural shifts in our cost as well. We listed costs in a hybrid environment as well as the structural shift in our personnel cost, which is a part of our SG&A., I think is an important part of this program, it\u2019s a structural shift.\nJan Siegmund: Yes, we \u2013 we should mention that we did, I think, in our script that we are focusing on non-billable and corporate functions. So these are intended to actually lower our SG&A rate basically.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. And then a follow-up, Ravi, on the large deal front, I guess, maybe the sales force. Can you talk about what you\u2019re doing specifically in these large deal pursuits and maybe your initial assessment of the sales force and the semi structure, I am curious what you may have put in place here early on in 1Q to give you some quick wins?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So we\u2019re very excited about the large deal momentum. This is initial momentum based on the bookings this quarter as well as a good pipeline. I would say there are two swim lanes to this. One is a swim lane on transformation deals, which I think, in some ways, now a little slowdown with the current economics environment. There is a second swim lane on cost takeout, cost takeout, specifically in industries, which went through a higher growth rate in the last few years, but are starting to go back to the post pre-pandemic growth rates. They are starting to see that there is significant opportunity to take out cost, and they are using vendor consolidation or cost takeout as a way to construct a large deal. I see more of them now. And I would say both the simulants are equally important as the economy takes an upturn, you\u2019re going to see more transformational digital work coming the other way. So I would really say both \u2013 these are the two big categories of large deals. And the industries where we see more of it are the ones where there was a swing of growth during the upswing \u2013 forward trajectory of growth in the last few years where that growth has started to taper down. The timing wise, also the labor market is a little soft end. So this is a good time for all our clients to start to get efficiencies and cost takeout and use a partner like Cognizant to support it. So we see more of them now than before. And of course, it\u2019s also reflective that our clients have the confidence to \u2013 for us to execute to those deals.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. \nRavi Kumar: Hey, Ashwin, you may be on mute.\nAshwin Shirvaikar: Hey, I am sorry. I didn\u2019t recognize it was my name being called, sorry. Hi, Ravi. Hi, Jan. Good to hear from you. Clearly, you guys have both been very busy. I appreciate the well thought-out commentary. I guess I wanted to ask, first, about the cadence that you expect. Obviously, you\u2019ve given Q2 outlook. Is there more of a ratable improvement from that rate to get to the full year? Or is it more of a \u2013 I don\u2019t want to call it a 4Q hockey stick, but is it a sharper improvement to the positive for 4Q? And then a similar question on margins, if you can talk about cadence.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. I mean you see our revenue guidance for the second quarter is largely in line with our revenue guidance in the first quarter. And so we do not anticipate a really material contribution of the large deals that we signed until the third and fourth quarter of this year. So we do anticipate revenue growth acceleration throughout the fiscal year throughout the quarters. And I think we\u2019re giving you a fair revenue guidance for the second quarter. We did still see basically pressure on some discretionary projects and smaller deals, as I mentioned in in my comments before. So I think the revenue guidance is kind of where we really solidly think we\u2019re going to be at. The margin guidance is a very important question, Ashwin. Keep in mind, we do implement for the vast majority. We have implemented in April a merit increase. And the second quarter will, therefore, be different from our historic profile of margin that we have shown in the past year. So our second quarter, I think, warrants a good look of what happens when we implement that merit increase, which happened historically in our fourth quarter. And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that\u2019s going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter.  << And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that\u2019s going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter. That\u2019s why I am mentioning it. And if you do the math of our comparable merit increase in the fourth quarter and exclude the one-time components of the fourth quarter that we had, you will see that in the fourth quarter, we recorded about 100 basis points impact of that merit increase on our margins. And fair to assume that things wouldn\u2019t be that different in the second quarter, may be actually probably slightly a little bit more pressure because the economy is changing a little bit. But that\u2019s kind of the framework. That\u2019s why I want to point that out, so. And then the people action of our NextGen program, we are going to start to execute in the second quarter, but given of how we are going to be executing, of course third quarter and the fourth quarter will be reflecting the impact of a big portion of them \u2013 good portion of that program.\nRavi Kumar: And Ashwin, if you \u2013 just to jog your memory on this, we actually did one in October, a merit cycle, and we are doing one more in April. So, these are two merit cycles. In fact, three merit cycles in 18 months. It\u2019s good for our associates. It starts to reflect on our attrition numbers starting to drop. And you have already seen that it\u2019s an investment for the future, but it equally has pressure on our margins.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. I guess the first part of that question was on revenue cadence, if you could address that. But then I also want to ask you, your headcount did go down sequentially. When do you expect that to stabilize and start to grow, I guess in anticipation of revenue growth in the future? And what part do you think increased automation? Applying AI to yourselves might play as you think of headcount in the future?\nRavi Kumar: Ashwin, that\u2019s a great question actually. One of the things, as I mentioned my priorities is to get commercial momentum, large deals, reduce our attrition and be an employer of choice. The third piece I spoke about is simplification of our operations. The NextGen program is an important program to de-layer our organization and to simplify our operations. Equally, one of the things we want to bring a huge cadence on, I think in the last 12 months or so, we had some \u2013 we had a very good initiative around pricing in the market. And that\u2019s a way to actually keep your margins intact. One of the focus areas for me moving forward is increased utilization, higher off-shoring, better pyramid ratios, better leverage of Gen C program. And the fourth is what you just mentioned, which is embrace of automation in everything we do. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I launched a platform called Neuro IT Operations where we want to go relentless on a client automation to ourselves, both on technology as well as IT operations and of course, on the process side. So, we do think this is going to be a little bit of a structural shift in the way we see our operating model, where we look at an uplift of margins, not just through pricing, but also through operational efficiencies and the leverage of automation. Automation is a moving scale. When everybody moves on that scale, you then start to share those benefits with your clients. And when you start to share those benefits with your clients, you have to re-innovate so that you can actually be ahead of the curve and keep it for yourself. So, it\u2019s kind of a cycle you have to keep working on. And when everybody \u2013 when you start to share it with your clients, when there is a new baseline, you have to re-baseline it with more innovation. So, I would say we are now \u2013 we have got into that rhythm. So, we are very excited about how we could be competitive to our deals, which we are starting to see and how we could also on the downstream price deals to win and deliver them to margins using automation as a lever. So, it\u2019s an important shift in the way we are seeing our operating model. And it\u2019s an evolving scale because of the fact that technology in that space is evolving so fast, including the leverage of generative AI to increase developer productivity, which is the new thing we are working on.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Following up on the last question, Ravi, can you maybe talk about the level of productivity gains in terms of potentially automation and the level of disruption here? And what I am getting to here is, is there the potential for a step function change? And if there is a step function change, how does that impact the revenue model as you look over the long-term, right? I assume you won\u2019t be able to generate the same level of revenues for a given level of service.\nRavi Kumar: It\u2019s an interesting question because it all depends on how much you want to leverage the productivity you generate out of these tools and instrumentation and platforms into your deals and use that to win more and share it with your clients. And how much you could actually constantly innovate beyond the time when you start to win the deals to when you start to execute the deals. So, it\u2019s a very difficult one because it\u2019s a moving scale because nobody spoke about generative AI in 2022. Everybody is speaking about it because just the scale at which it\u2019s come to disrupt various businesses in the world, including ours, right. So, I would say it\u2019s a hard one to put a quantifiable impact on revenue and on margins. It is a moving scale. We have to be constantly ahead of the curve. And again, constantly ahead of the curve not to execute programs, but also equally to win business because these are the same productivity baselines we actually take it to our proposals. So, sometimes, we wonder as the baselines constantly change whether it will translate that back to your bottom line, or it will translate that back to better win ratio. So, you have to keep that balance so that you have growth. And equally, you are able to generate that growth in a profitable way by not just leveraging the traditional levers of higher utilization, higher off-shoring, better roll mix, but also using technology as a lever to do this. So, I know I have given you a high-level answer, but it\u2019s very hard to simulate and put a revenue model attached to it because it is just such a fast moving curve. I actually think we are well equipped to capitalize on the advances in the space and we are well equipped to generate the value for our clients, and we are well equipped to actually evolve our business model, which is potentially going to go from people to a people-plus-machines model, if I may, or a people-plus-AI or AI-amplified-human model, which I have been very fascinated about.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Keane: Yes. Hi. I just had a question on the overall IT services environment. Just thinking in your conversations you had with the 100 or so clients, Ravi. Are people expecting the environment to stay similar in their IT spending budgets, or do you think people will put further pressure on budgets and IT spend as we go forward through this year?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. It\u2019s a great question, actually. I will kind of pivot this in a little different direction. If you are working on traditional technologies or classical technologies, as I call it, which is enabling a business, the pressure on IT budgets is going to be very high because a lot of it is cost driven. If you are building a CRM system, if you are building an HR system, a supply chain system. I think the pressure of IT budgets with the economic uncertainty is going to be very \u2013 it\u2019s going to be tight. That\u2019s how I see it. If you are leveraging technology to disrupt the core of a business, as an example, if you are doing the connected car initiative of an automotive company, I don\u2019t think budgets will come on the way because it\u2019s a disruption of the business model. Equally, the capability you need is going to be deep as well, which means you have to build different swim lanes in your operating model so that you could cater to classical technologies on one side, but equally cater to deep expertise needed for disrupting the core of businesses. This is a swim lane which did not exist before because most businesses enable the businesses using technology, now, technologies emerged into businesses, which I think will have more flexibility on budgets because the paranoia about the core changing means you could become irrelevant if you don\u2019t make the change, and therefore, you allocate more for securing your future as a business. Some industries are doing it more paranoid because there is more change in the core products and services, and some are actually not as worried about this issue. I would say, depending on where you are, this would \u2013 you would find IT budgets to be under stress or you are able to find IT budgets not to be under stress. The second piece, I would say, we all have to think about is our universe is not as much just tech spend of enterprises. Our universe is operations spend of enterprises because technology is so deeply emerged into operations. So, if you put that lens in, operations, which have to be automated for better experience, for lower cost, for higher \u2013 for high-touch services, you could potentially immerse in technology, outsource and immerse in technology for companies like Cognizant to benefit out of it. So, if I see that as the universe, that\u2019s a very different universe. In fact, just to give you a case in point, there are companies which have accumulated cost equivalent to the growth rate during the pandemic. And when they go back to the pre-pandemic, those growth rates start to taper down. They have to take their operations cost down. So, they could either do it by automating it, or they could do it by outsourcing and off-shoring it. And so you can have a benefit there. So, I would say these are three different things to look at. Even today, there is a consolidation of providers, cost takeout, which is actually winning in the terms, as I call it, where customers don\u2019t spend more, but there is a swap of the portfolio between one provider to another provider, which means one wins and one loses. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 if I just look at straight IT spend in classical technologies, you have a different answer \u2013 for core, you would have a different answer. And of course, if you are consolidating providers, it\u2019s a win for one and loss for somebody else.\nBryan Keane: Okay. Great. Yes. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nTyler Scott: Great. Thank you everyone for joining. We look forward to catching up with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Cognizant Technology Solutions first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may disconnect now.",

            "name": "Jan Siegmund",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I touch on the details of the first quarter, I would like to spend a moment on the NextGen program we announced today. During the second quarter, we initiated NexGen to simplify our operating model, optimize our corporate functions and realign our office space to reflect our hybrid work environment. We expect to record total estimated NexGen costs of $400 million, approximately $350 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. This consists of $200 million of employee severance and other costs primarily related to non-billable and corporate personnel which we expect to mostly incur in 2023. The personnel-related actions under this program are expected to impact approximately 3,500 associates or approximately 1% of our total workforce. We expect to realize savings from our NexGen initiative in the back half of this year. The NexGen program also includes $200 million of costs related to the consolidation of office space and approximately $150 million in 2023 and $50 million in 2024. We do not anticipate these real estate actions will begin to generate savings until 2024. By 2025, we expect to reduce our annual real estate costs by approximately $100 million versus 2022. This reduction is net of investments to expand our real estate footprint in smaller cities, primarily in India, in support of our hybrid work strategy. Our full year operating margin outlook includes the anticipated impact of these actions. As Ravi mentioned, we expect this program to help enable us to deliver 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion in 2024, in addition to funding revenue growth opportunities. This 2024 expectation assumes no further deterioration of the economic environment. Beyond 2024, we are focused on driving structural cost improvements to fund investments to support revenue growth, our people and modernization of facilities while driving consistent, modest margin expansion. Now moving on to the details for the quarter. We were pleased to deliver revenue above the high end of our guidance range, strong free cash flow and healthy large deal bookings, which has helped us to begin to replenish our backlog following muted bookings growth throughout 2022. First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 30 basis points year-over-year or growth of plus 1.5% in constant currency. Year-over-year growth includes approximately 100 basis points of growth from our recent acquisitions. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with our bookings performance in the first quarter, including the mix shift towards larger deals. We also exited the quarter with a strong pipeline of larger opportunities across industries. At the same time, we also saw pressure in smaller contracts, which we believe is a result of a softer discretionary spending being driven by the macro environment. This environment has a near-term impact on our revenue in the second quarter, which I will touch on in my guidance commentary. Moving on to segment results for the first quarter where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Within Financial Services, revenue declined 1%. Revenue pressure within our North American portfolio was partially offset by growth in our global growth public sector and insurance clients. In the first quarter, bookings growth within financial services outpaced the total company, and we are seeing an improving pipeline of opportunities over the next 12 months. While we have begun to see signs of stabilization, we are still rebuilding our backlog as we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment. We believe this uncertainty has impacted the pace of client decision-making and put pressure on discretionary budgets. It has also resulted in new pipeline opportunities around cost savings, efficiency and vendor consolidation which we are actively pursuing. Health Sciences revenue grew 4%, consistent with last quarter. Growth was driven by increased demand from health care payer clients for our integrated software solutions. Products and Resources revenue grew 1%, reflecting inorganic contribution from recently completed acquisitions and continued strength among logistics, utility and travel and hospitality customers. This was partially offset by pressure from retail, consumer goods and manufacturing customers, which we believe reflects the economic environment. Communications, Media and Technology revenue grew 4%, reflecting slower growth among our largest technology clients and muted growth among communications and media clients. Similar to our other segments, we believe the macroeconomic environment pace of decision-making and discretionary spending among our CMT clients. Continuing with our year-over-year growth in constant currency from a geographic perspective in Q1, North America revenue declined 1%. This performance reflected declines within Financial Services and Products and Resources, partially offset by growth in Health Sciences. Our global growth markets, or GGM, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 7%. Growth was again led by the UK, which grew 14% and included strong double-digit growth within Financial Services, including public sector clients and CMT. Now moving on to margins. In Q1, both our GAAP and adjusted operating margins were 14.6% as there were no non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, both GAAP and adjusted operating margin declined by 40 basis points. This primarily reflects gross margin pressure from increased compensation costs, partially offset by tailwinds from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, lower SG&A expenses and the benefit of 2022 pricing actions. Our GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%. The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.5%. Our effective tax rate included a discrete benefit from a settlement of prior year tax audits. Year 1, diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and adjusted EPS was $1.11, up 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.5 billion or net cash of $1.8 billion. DSO of 73 days was down 1 day sequentially and increased 1 day year-over-year. Free cash flow in Q1 was $631 million, representing approximately 110% of net income. This compares to free cash flow of $186 million in the prior year period, which represented approximately 35% of net income. The increase in free cash flow was driven by strong collections. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for $200 million under our share repurchase program and returned $150 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. We also closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter, Mobica, which helps bolster our IoT software engineering capabilities; and the professional and application management services business of OneSource Virtual, a Workday partner. Over the last 6 months, we have deployed approximately $800 million of capital across 4 acquisitions. Before we move to our outlook, I would like to spend a moment to discuss the change in our attrition disclosure. As you heard Ravi mentioned, we are now disclosing voluntary attrition tech services on a trailing 12-month basis, which we believe is most relevant to our business. This new metric includes all employees, except those in our intuitive operations automation practice, and replaces our prior disclosure. Now turning to our forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.83 billion to $4.88 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.6% to minus 0.6%, or a decline of minus 1% to flat in constant currency. Our guidance assumes currency will have a negative 60 basis points impact as well as an inorganic contribution of approximately 100 basis points. We are also providing initial full year 2023 revenue and operating margin guidance. Our focus for the remainder of the year is to continue to replenish our backlog to successive quarters of strong bookings performance, which we believe would improve revenue momentum towards the end of this year and as we enter 2024. For the full year, we are guiding revenue in the range of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion, representing a decline of minus 1.2% to growth of plus 0.8%, or a decline of minus 1% to growth of plus 1% in constant currency. Inorganic contribution is expected to be approximately 100 basis points. This assumes no major deterioration in the demand environment, and our assumption that large deals we have signed and expect to sign in Q2 begin to ramp more meaningfully in the second half of the year. Moving on to the adjusted operating margin. We are guiding operating margin to be in the range of 14.2% to 14.7%. Our margin outlook is impacted by several factors. First, we expect the macroeconomic environment will impact pricing, which was a key lever for us in 2022 to help offset the elevated wage inflation. Second, we are achieving a faster pace of large deals than we initially anticipated. These larger deals generally have a dilutive impact in the first year. Finally, as mentioned, the NextGen program is not expected to drive meaningful savings until the back half of this year. For real estate, we anticipate initial savings in 2024 and a full run rate in 2025. Our operating margin guidance also assumes a sequential decline in Q2 as a result of the merit cycle that took effect from April 1. As a reminder, this is our second merit cycle for the majority of our employees in the last 6 months. We anticipate 2023 interest income of approximately $85 million, reflecting the higher interest rate environment, and an adjusted tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. In 2023, we expect to deploy approximately $800 million on share repurchases, including the activity in Q1. This assumes repurchase activity above our long-term capital allocation framework and will reduce our weighted average share count by approximately 2.5% in 2023. Based on the share repurchase activity, we anticipate full year average shares outstanding of approximately 506 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.11 to $4.34, which reflects our wider-than-typical operating margin guidance. Finally, we are targeting free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% of net income, which assumes the negative impact from the changes in the U.S. tax law that we discussed in February. We now estimate the negative year-over-year impact of $540 million from this change, which is slightly down from our prior estimate. This includes approximately $300 million in deferred payments relating to 2022. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Yes. Lisa, the 9% trailing 12 months bookings growth is really entirely driven by the very strong bookings growth in the quarter. In this quarter, as you know, we had three quarters of flat bookings that contributed to this overall trailing 12-month result. And so the revenue growth, in this case, will be picking up. We expect a model in our revenue guidance, some revenue impact from these larger deals picking and starting and ramping up in the second quarter \u2013 in the second half of this fiscal year and then have a full year impact next year. So for the second quarter, impacting our guidance is also the anticipation that we see softness in the small-scale bookings. So the second quarter, in a sense, it's kind of a transition quarter, I would say, because we have the high bookings growth, hopefully, continued momentum in bookings as we go through the year. But we do have a short-term revenue impact from the decline of these shorter and smaller deals that are impacted by the economy, by discretionary spend. So that's kind of how I think best to understand the relationship between bookings and revenue growth. Yes, Bryan, there is many moving parts here. So let me talk first about the overall program of $400 million of restructuring charges, of which $200 million comes from severance and $200 million comes from real estate. We provided really only an expected run rate savings rate to materialize in \u201825 at the full range of $100 million for the real estate component. We offer that savings opportunity because we feel it's hard from the outside to calculate of how restructuring charges in the real estate space translate actually into full run rate savings. So that's kind of we wanted to help you with the impact of the $200 million component for real estate with that. A portion of that, a meaningful portion of that will be achieved in \u201824 and then the full run rate in \u201825. On the severance, we haven't given you a net impact or a gross impact. Number one, I think you can fairly easily calculate by the number of employees affected in the severance volume that we anticipate and make an assumption about the cost savings that we would see. There are many factors, and you'd see this reflected in a relatively wide range of margin that we gave for the year is wage inflation there is an uncertain pricing environment and other things that we will have to manage through. So we haven't given more detail about the $200 million severance charge at this point in time. For \u201824, the 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion would be off the exit rate in \u201823, and that would be our current outlook to \u201824. It should signal from our point of view, our confidence that the full run rate of this program will help us to not only offset large deal pressure that we're going to see for this first year business cases of the larger deals plus the wage inflation or other elements for \u201824. So it's a little unusual that we give that early in expectation on the margin. But we felt, given that the program is fairly sizable and only a portion it is going to be realized in \u201823, it will be helpful for you to know that we are confident about return to margin expansion in \u201824. Yes, we \u2013 we should mention that we did, I think, in our script that we are focusing on non-billable and corporate functions. So these are intended to actually lower our SG&A rate basically."

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler. Good afternoon, everyone. When I spoke to you early February, I was just 3 weeks into my role. I explained my plan to move rapidly up the learning curve by embarking on a global listening and learning tour with associates, clients and partners. I also mentioned that I would meet with more than 100 clients and as many of our associates as possible. In addition, I outlined three interrelated priorities: making Cognizant an employer of choice in its industry; accelerate revenue growth, especially by winning large deals; and enhancing our operational discipline. I will comment on progress of each of these areas, but first, I want to cover a few of the quarter's financial and operational highlights. In quarter one, we delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, a decline of 0.3% year-over-year as reported, but a growth of 1.5% in constant currency, above the high-end of our guidance range. Our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%. We recorded strong quarterly bookings growth of 28% year-over-year and ended quarter one with record trailing 12 months bookings of $25.6 billion in the trailing 12 months book-to-bill of 1.3x. Approximately, 30% of our in-quarter or quarter one bookings were large deals, which we define as total contract value of about $50 million compared to approximately 20% for all of 2022. We were very pleased with our first quarter bookings performance as well as the build in our pipeline, which includes a strong mix of large new opportunities. I am especially pleased to see the continuing reduction in our attrition with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business declining to 23%, down 3% points sequentially and 7 points Y-on-Y year-on-year. While Jan will cover our financial performance at the business segment level, given the importance of financial services on our momentum, I want to comment on the state of this business and the emerging opportunities we see in this segment. For starters, we believe our company-specific operational challenges in financial services have largely subsided and we are beginning to stabilize the business. Our client portfolio has shown resilience, both in U.S. and internationally, but we are also seeing the impact from softer discretionary spending and decision delays by existing and potential clients. In the U.S., our banking clients are generally large institutions, and we have seen an uptick in our deal pipeline. Overall, we have seen early green shoots that we are moving this portfolio in the right direction while navigating the macro dynamics. We are encouraged by leading indicators such as strong Q1 global bookings growth for financial services at a rate above the company average as well as an uptick in our large deal pipeline. I am particularly encouraged by my conversations with about two dozen of our financial services clients. I came away from these meetings with many new opportunities to pursue related to cost takeout, vendor consolidation, post-merger integration and a new wave of outsourcing in fintechs. Having said that, we still have a lot of work ahead, and we will be closely monitoring the environment to anticipate shifts in our clients' needs. To-date, I have met either in person or virtually with C-suite executors from more than 100 of our clients representing nearly all of our industry segments and all of our major geographies. Several teams have surfaced from these candid conversations. We have a strong goodwill with our clients and continue to recognize a culture of client centricity. This way, we are easy to work with, attentive to nurturing our client relationships and deeply understand their businesses. They like our entrepreneurial approach to developing solutions to their challenges. They also appreciate our humility, our willingness to learn, listen and adapt. I believe the longevity and depth of our relationships have created a lot of accumulated trust. By the way, none of our clients I spoke to mentioned about Cognizant's digital mix. I believe that's because digital and non-digital capabilities have converged to the point where the distinction between the two is less significant. Instead, the differentiator many clients have spoken about is how well positioned Cognizant is that the confluence of technology and industry domains. Given that our digital mix is no longer a true measure of the value we are providing to clients, we have decided to stop disclosing this metric. With that said, clients want more from us. They trust us with their agenda, strategies and competitive challenges. They tell me Cognizant has earned the right to challenge their thinking and be a strategic partner who co-create solutions with them and offers insights on improving their operations. Overall, I came away with the sense that many clients are fans of our company. What also surfaced is that most clients are grappling with largely similar challenges, although with variations by industry. The cost basis reflect the higher growth levels seen during the pandemic era, prompting an intensified focus on optimizing cost and efficiency and building greater resilience. They need to digitize workflows, enhance their customer and employee experiences and boost the efficiency of their commercial and operational teams. In that context, I thought it would be useful to mention a few recent client wins that underscore the strategic cloud-focused work we do for clients and a skill-as-a-systems integrator. We are partnering with Microsoft to build an integration roadmap between our TriZetto health products and the cloud for healthcare. Our shared aim is to give payers and providers easy access to cutting-edge technology solutions, streamlined claims management and improved interoperability to deliver better patient and member experiences. In a new win, we are working with Boehringer Ingelheim to speed the development and improve the accuracy of their life-saving therapies. We help our clients unify medicinal development processes and data into unified cloud platform and enhance the collaboration across clinical, regulatory and quality functions. We've been engaged by works within Group Ireland to reengineer its siloed contact center platform into omnichannel customer service landscape that will deliver more personalized agent and customer experiences using Salesforce Cloud and Amazon Connect. And last week, we announced a new 5-year agreement to transform and support the global technology operations of a long-term client, Nike. We will help drive customer, employee and partner experiences from Nike by leveraging hyper-automation, AI and processing reengineering. These are just a few examples. In short, our capabilities are in demand as clients navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Let's turn to the company's three focus areas of growth enablers and the progress we are beginning to make. The first of these is to become an employer of choice. We recognize this as a multiyear undertaking. To take the pulse of employee sentiment, I've been using every communication channel available to get unfiltered feedback from tens of thousands of associates to learn what's what needs to improve. As a part of my immersion, I spent 2 weeks in India visiting a half a dozen cities where we have major facilities, along with traveling to see associates in the UK, Switzerland, Canada and across the U.S. I've been moved by our associates warmth, enthusiasm and energy, and what I am hearing from them is very encouraging. In this post-pandemic era, we are back to walking the corridors for clients, mining relationships and building new ones, and we're revitalizing our ability to land and expand within existing clients as we steadily bring on new accounts. Across the organization, I see a rising pride in the company. Associates at all levels of our company want to partner with me to begin writing the next chapter in Cognizant's nearly 30-year history and are moving forward with renewed confidence about the future. To be an employer of choice, we need to meet the demands of a diverse workforce that spans geographies, generation and the range of work and life priorities. Here are a few of our approaches. We have made career progression easier by expanding our internal job board process and redesigning the promotion process to increase more movement across our organization. We have intensified our focus on continuous upscaling and learning by expanding a learning library, running internal learning and development campaigns and launching a new leadership training initiative for people at all levels. We have had three merit increases in 18 months for the majority of our associates who are in the levels up to associate director. And over the past couple of years, we've invested significantly more in compensation. In addition, we are stepping up the efforts to get our associates to return to office because doing so, we believe, helps build and sustain our culture and helps associates build their social capital with colleagues. To tap into the creativity of our more than 350,000 associates, we are launching a grassroots innovation movement because I believe innovative ideas can come from everyone. This program called Blue Bold encourages and celebrates the thousands of flashes of inspiration that our associates have every day as they innovate for our clients. Over the coming months, we plan to train more than 20,000 additional project leads in our innovation methods and generate over 100,000 ideas for client to use rapid prototyping and the identification of new opportunities. A second focus area I've spoken about is accelerating revenue growth and building commercial momentum, especially by strengthening our ability to win large deals. Our Q1 bookings were a balance of renewals, expansions and new engagements, which we believe will provide revenue opportunities for us later in the year and valid to 2024. Our strong bookings growth in the quarter, including four deals with a total contract value of about $100 million. To cite one large deal, one recent large deal, Horizon Healthcare Services selected us to manage their claims processing and counter submissions to the state and enrollment services for their 1.2 million members. In the 7-year renewal agreement, we will bring to bear advanced automation solutions for our TriZetto product suite to help Horizon expedite the claims payment process and ensure accuracy in support of their member services. Our large deal pipeline remains healthy for the next couple of quarters. Large deal bookings that aligned with our risk appetite are essential to building commercial momentum, but they can take time to ramp up and realize revenue. We are working on strengthening and industrializing delivery to support our execution of large deals. Moving to our third priority, operational excellence. As you may recall from my last call, I said that internal simplification would be a team will carry forward to help achieve the company's full potential. Our drive for simplification will include operating with fewer layers to deliver greater agility along with realigning the business to be closer to our clients and employees, and of course, to increase a growth mindset. This endeavor named NextGen is aimed at building the enterprise of the future by simplifying our business operations, optimizing our corporate functions and realigning our workforce to a post-pandemic era of hybrid and redistributed work. This shift will provide an opportunity to rationalize the workspaces across the world and especially in India's largest cities where we're distributing some real estate to smaller cities where we can expand and by modernizing some existing space. We expect the structural shift in our real estate costs to help eliminate 80,000 seats and 11 million square feet in large cities in India. This shift will also enable us to invest in collaboration spaces in smaller cities while creating structural savings for the future that we can invest in our people and growth opportunities. We expect this program to help enable us to deliver margin expansion in the range of 20 to 40 basis points in 2024 while supporting a large deal pipeline. Combined with our efforts to increase utilization, improve delivery efficiency, maintain disciplined pricing and a lower attrition, we believe we have the levers to drive modest margin expansion over the next several years while we continue to fund growth investments in 2024 and beyond. Recognizing how much work we have ahead of us, I plan to provide periodic updates about our progress in achieving these three priorities. Let's spend a moment on the demand environment and tech trends. We are carefully monitoring what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment and with its potential for shifts in client priorities. That said, we are optimistic about our long-term opportunity within the IT services market. The demand for solutions and business outcomes remain solid as technology becomes core to nearly every business. The tech trend on everyone's mind is generative AI with recent breakthroughs offering the potential to fundamentally transform our clients' businesses and increase our own productivity. To that end, we are accelerating our investment in generative AI. Our AI accelerator process uses studio environments to collaborate with clients to identify priority AI use cases and rapidly implement prototype solutions for field testing. We have conducted ideation sessions with over 30 clients and are now working to industrialize solutions to their common challenges. We believe generative AI will revolutionize the technology services industry, creating higher rates of productivity and driving greater prominence for software and data engineering expertise. We are using AI to enhance our own creativity and productivity. We are operating pilots that use generative AI to accelerate consulting, design, engineering and operations with the long-term goal of doubling the productivity of our associates. With that in mind, last month, we launched a neuro IT operations, a next-generation platform that brings new levels of automation and intelligence to applications and infrastructure operations. By applying an AI-led automation-first approach, we are enabling enterprises to innovate faster and drive down cost and risk. We believe that enacting new IT operations can actually reduce operational costs by 25% to 45%, reduce mean time to delivery and mean time to detect by 30% to 50% and reduce FTEs by 15% to 30% compared with the use of traditional approaches. Across every industry, the cloud is today the biggest transformational opportunity, and therefore, our clients need a partner that can orchestrate cloud in a heterogeneous environment. In response, we just introduced a new cloud platform called Cognizant Skygrade. This multi-hybrid cloud and edge management platform applies an industry-focused approach designed to help clients transition to a modern cloud-native architecture, develop modern applications that evolve with the pace of business and streamline the cloud management operations. With Skygrade, we believe we can accelerate migration and modernization programs by shortening transformation time by 20% to 40%, resulting in faster value realization while reducing ongoing run and governance costs by 15% to 25%. To wrap up, I stand behind my initial assessment that Cognizant has the strong foundation in place on which we could accelerate growth. I am especially optimistic about the strength of our portfolio and partner ecosystem, combined with our ability to create value for our clients at the intersection of technology and industry use cases. We recognize that our renewed strength in bookings momentum is helping us replenish a softer backlog from the past 9 months, and we believe we can demonstrate improved growth towards the end of this year and in 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan to provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2023. Jan, over to you. Thank you, Lisa. I'm going to \u2013 this is Ravi here. I'm going to start off and then ask Jan to add. We recorded very strong bookings, 28% year-on-year and 12-month trailing bookings of $25.6 billion. And you're right, book-to-bill ratio is at 1.3x. I think the way to see it is it has multiple factors associated with it. First and foremost, how much of it is renewable? How much of it is new? How much of it is expansion? While we don't give those numbers out, we had healthy expansion and new business in comparison to the past. We had four large deals more than total contract value of $100 million. Just to give you an order of magnitude. Last year, same quarter, we did not have any large deals. Large deals come with a little bit of \u2013 it comes with a runway where a lot of it is at the end of the cycle or rather at the back of the cycle. Short deals, small deals come with immediate short-fuse demand, which gives you revenue on the short run. Large deals give you revenue on the medium to long run, while in the short run, they take a little time to ramp up. So in summary, how this translates to revenue in the short and the medium and the long run is dependent on what percentage of it is large deals, what percentage of it is small deals. You would appreciate small deals are actually a little softer for us because we've \u2013 we know that the discretionary spend is softening in an economic environment we are in. So the large deals gives us the opportunity to accrue revenues at the back end of this year and the next year while we build the pipe for the future. Our pipeline is looking strong as well. Thank you, Lisa. I've met more than 100 clients in my first 100 days across all geographies, and traveled extensively to meet them and my associates. I would say, just to keep the high-level observations, I think our clients love the confluence of technology and industry demand which Cognizant really comes with. Cognizant, if you go back to the history of Cognizant, it was bought at a time when there was a tail end of the ride to cable, and it was born to be application outsourcing wave, which was starting off. And Cognizant built the capability on a confluence of industry and domain. And industry and domain, the confluence is very important now than ever before because we all know that we are living in a golden era of technology where the core of every business in every industry is transitioning to a technology-led core or a technology must core. So I would say we have to progressively make sure that the confluence of technology and industry, we actually demonstrate the differentiation in every industry we represent. Our biggest exposure is healthcare, life sciences, financial services, which is where I think we have really doubled down on this confluence and we now have to progressively build in every other industry. The second piece, I would say, is client centricity. I think over the years, Cognizant's growth has actually come from mining accounts with the breadth of capability Cognizant brings. And of course, the entrepreneur spirit of our teams. These are the three things which stood out for me. And in fact, some clients actually who have worked with us for very long, actually said we are fans of Cognizant. I mentioned that on my initial remarks. And that was \u2013 that really stuck to me that these are clients who want us to move with them, who want us to challenge them and to want us to co-create along with them for their technology future, if \u2013 in \u2013 So there can never be a better time for the confluence of technology and industry, and I think we are so well positioned for that. Just adding one additional thing out here. I think these are two structural shifts in our cost as well. We listed costs in a hybrid environment as well as the structural shift in our personnel cost, which is a part of our SG&A., I think is an important part of this program, it's a structural shift. Yes. So we're very excited about the large deal momentum. This is initial momentum based on the bookings this quarter as well as a good pipeline. I would say there are two swim lanes to this. One is a swim lane on transformation deals, which I think, in some ways, now a little slowdown with the current economics environment. There is a second swim lane on cost takeout, cost takeout, specifically in industries, which went through a higher growth rate in the last few years, but are starting to go back to the post pre-pandemic growth rates. They are starting to see that there is significant opportunity to take out cost, and they are using vendor consolidation or cost takeout as a way to construct a large deal. I see more of them now. And I would say both the simulants are equally important as the economy takes an upturn, you're going to see more transformational digital work coming the other way. So I would really say both \u2013 these are the two big categories of large deals. And the industries where we see more of it are the ones where there was a swing of growth during the upswing \u2013 forward trajectory of growth in the last few years where that growth has started to taper down. The timing wise, also the labor market is a little soft end. So this is a good time for all our clients to start to get efficiencies and cost takeout and use a partner like Cognizant to support it. So we see more of them now than before. And of course, it's also reflective that our clients have the confidence to \u2013 for us to execute to those deals. Hey, Ashwin, you may be on mute. Yes. I mean you see our revenue guidance for the second quarter is largely in line with our revenue guidance in the first quarter. And so we do not anticipate a really material contribution of the large deals that we signed until the third and fourth quarter of this year. So we do anticipate revenue growth acceleration throughout the fiscal year throughout the quarters. And I think we're giving you a fair revenue guidance for the second quarter. We did still see basically pressure on some discretionary projects and smaller deals, as I mentioned in in my comments before. So I think the revenue guidance is kind of where we really solidly think we're going to be at. The margin guidance is a very important question, Ashwin. Keep in mind, we do implement for the vast majority. We have implemented in April a merit increase. And the second quarter will, therefore, be different from our historic profile of margin that we have shown in the past year. So our second quarter, I think, warrants a good look of what happens when we implement that merit increase, which happened historically in our fourth quarter. And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that's going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter.  << And so think of it as a normal merit increase and the margin pressure that we will get from it. And that's going to be some material impact for us in the second quarter. That's why I am mentioning it. And if you do the math of our comparable merit increase in the fourth quarter and exclude the one-time components of the fourth quarter that we had, you will see that in the fourth quarter, we recorded about 100 basis points impact of that merit increase on our margins. And fair to assume that things wouldn't be that different in the second quarter, may be actually probably slightly a little bit more pressure because the economy is changing a little bit. But that's kind of the framework. That's why I want to point that out, so. And then the people action of our NextGen program, we are going to start to execute in the second quarter, but given of how we are going to be executing, of course third quarter and the fourth quarter will be reflecting the impact of a big portion of them \u2013 good portion of that program. And Ashwin, if you \u2013 just to jog your memory on this, we actually did one in October, a merit cycle, and we are doing one more in April. So, these are two merit cycles. In fact, three merit cycles in 18 months. It's good for our associates. It starts to reflect on our attrition numbers starting to drop. And you have already seen that it's an investment for the future, but it equally has pressure on our margins. Ashwin, that's a great question actually. One of the things, as I mentioned my priorities is to get commercial momentum, large deals, reduce our attrition and be an employer of choice. The third piece I spoke about is simplification of our operations. The NextGen program is an important program to de-layer our organization and to simplify our operations. Equally, one of the things we want to bring a huge cadence on, I think in the last 12 months or so, we had some \u2013 we had a very good initiative around pricing in the market. And that's a way to actually keep your margins intact. One of the focus areas for me moving forward is increased utilization, higher off-shoring, better pyramid ratios, better leverage of Gen C program. And the fourth is what you just mentioned, which is embrace of automation in everything we do. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I launched a platform called Neuro IT Operations where we want to go relentless on a client automation to ourselves, both on technology as well as IT operations and of course, on the process side. So, we do think this is going to be a little bit of a structural shift in the way we see our operating model, where we look at an uplift of margins, not just through pricing, but also through operational efficiencies and the leverage of automation. Automation is a moving scale. When everybody moves on that scale, you then start to share those benefits with your clients. And when you start to share those benefits with your clients, you have to re-innovate so that you can actually be ahead of the curve and keep it for yourself. So, it's kind of a cycle you have to keep working on. And when everybody \u2013 when you start to share it with your clients, when there is a new baseline, you have to re-baseline it with more innovation. So, I would say we are now \u2013 we have got into that rhythm. So, we are very excited about how we could be competitive to our deals, which we are starting to see and how we could also on the downstream price deals to win and deliver them to margins using automation as a lever. So, it's an important shift in the way we are seeing our operating model. And it's an evolving scale because of the fact that technology in that space is evolving so fast, including the leverage of generative AI to increase developer productivity, which is the new thing we are working on. It's an interesting question because it all depends on how much you want to leverage the productivity you generate out of these tools and instrumentation and platforms into your deals and use that to win more and share it with your clients. And how much you could actually constantly innovate beyond the time when you start to win the deals to when you start to execute the deals. So, it's a very difficult one because it's a moving scale because nobody spoke about generative AI in 2022. Everybody is speaking about it because just the scale at which it's come to disrupt various businesses in the world, including ours, right. So, I would say it's a hard one to put a quantifiable impact on revenue and on margins. It is a moving scale. We have to be constantly ahead of the curve. And again, constantly ahead of the curve not to execute programs, but also equally to win business because these are the same productivity baselines we actually take it to our proposals. So, sometimes, we wonder as the baselines constantly change whether it will translate that back to your bottom line, or it will translate that back to better win ratio. So, you have to keep that balance so that you have growth. And equally, you are able to generate that growth in a profitable way by not just leveraging the traditional levers of higher utilization, higher off-shoring, better roll mix, but also using technology as a lever to do this. So, I know I have given you a high-level answer, but it's very hard to simulate and put a revenue model attached to it because it is just such a fast moving curve. I actually think we are well equipped to capitalize on the advances in the space and we are well equipped to generate the value for our clients, and we are well equipped to actually evolve our business model, which is potentially going to go from people to a people-plus-machines model, if I may, or a people-plus-AI or AI-amplified-human model, which I have been very fascinated about. Yes. It's a great question, actually. I will kind of pivot this in a little different direction. If you are working on traditional technologies or classical technologies, as I call it, which is enabling a business, the pressure on IT budgets is going to be very high because a lot of it is cost driven. If you are building a CRM system, if you are building an HR system, a supply chain system. I think the pressure of IT budgets with the economic uncertainty is going to be very \u2013 it's going to be tight. That's how I see it. If you are leveraging technology to disrupt the core of a business, as an example, if you are doing the connected car initiative of an automotive company, I don't think budgets will come on the way because it's a disruption of the business model. Equally, the capability you need is going to be deep as well, which means you have to build different swim lanes in your operating model so that you could cater to classical technologies on one side, but equally cater to deep expertise needed for disrupting the core of businesses. This is a swim lane which did not exist before because most businesses enable the businesses using technology, now, technologies emerged into businesses, which I think will have more flexibility on budgets because the paranoia about the core changing means you could become irrelevant if you don't make the change, and therefore, you allocate more for securing your future as a business. Some industries are doing it more paranoid because there is more change in the core products and services, and some are actually not as worried about this issue. I would say, depending on where you are, this would \u2013 you would find IT budgets to be under stress or you are able to find IT budgets not to be under stress. The second piece, I would say, we all have to think about is our universe is not as much just tech spend of enterprises. Our universe is operations spend of enterprises because technology is so deeply emerged into operations. So, if you put that lens in, operations, which have to be automated for better experience, for lower cost, for higher \u2013 for high-touch services, you could potentially immerse in technology, outsource and immerse in technology for companies like Cognizant to benefit out of it. So, if I see that as the universe, that's a very different universe. In fact, just to give you a case in point, there are companies which have accumulated cost equivalent to the growth rate during the pandemic. And when they go back to the pre-pandemic, those growth rates start to taper down. They have to take their operations cost down. So, they could either do it by automating it, or they could do it by outsourcing and off-shoring it. And so you can have a benefit there. So, I would say these are three different things to look at. Even today, there is a consolidation of providers, cost takeout, which is actually winning in the terms, as I call it, where customers don't spend more, but there is a swap of the portfolio between one provider to another provider, which means one wins and one loses. So, it's kind of \u2013 if I just look at straight IT spend in classical technologies, you have a different answer \u2013 for core, you would have a different answer. And of course, if you are consolidating providers, it's a win for one and loss for somebody else."

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which delivered revenue and earnings growth while expanding adjusted margins sequentially and represented strong execution of our strategic priorities to accelerate growth, become an employer of choice in our industry and modernize operations. We are seeing a gradual rebound of spend cycles and gaining wallet share in financial services. While our historical strength in health sciences is driving differentiation and growth. Meanwhile, a significant traction with large deals and AI-led revenue opportunities, investments in talent and a steadfast focus on operational rigor together led to a strong all-round performance. Let me begin with a quick summary of our results before an update on our strategic priorities. Third quarter revenue was at the high end of our constant currency guidance range. Revenue of $5 billion grew 3.5% sequentially, in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Year-over-year revenue grew by approximately 2.7% in constant currency, including approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% improved sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline despite investments in Belcan in the partial quarter impact from our annual minute cycle. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 7% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, bringing our year-to-date EPS growth to approximately 5%. Now let me provide an update on the progress we made against our strategic priorities. First, accelerating growth. Our improving momentum was driven in the quarter by growth in our two largest segments, Health Sciences and Financial Services and contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Health Sciences increased 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency backed by our strong differentiated offerings. Financial Services returned to year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution and partial return of discretionary spending. And we maintained our large deal momentum, signing six deals, each with a total contract value of $100 million or more. Year-to-date, we signed 19 sub deals compared to 17 during all of 2023. We are excited about the all-around sustained momentum in large deals across industries and service lines. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we are getting in digital engineering, infrastructure and cloud services. We believe in order to sustain this momentum, we must remain at the forefront of our clients' innovation agenda where today, AI is at the top of the list. Our heritage of deep engineering and strong domain expertise intimate client relationships and flexible operating model has allowed us to quickly respond to this opportunity. We have rapidly developed practical tools to help our clients accelerate AI adoption, while also applying it to ourselves as we aim to significantly accelerate our own productivity. AI is a profound shift, what I call a double engine transformation because it offers Cognizant the chance to disrupt ourselves as much as it does for our clients. Consistent with our heritage, we spotted the AI opportunity early and in mid-2023, announced plans to invest $1 billion into AI initiatives, platforms and capabilities. Let me share some examples, beginning with our platforms where our clients are co-creating with us. The foundation of our AI strategy is powered by the Cognizant data and toolkit, which we utilized to increase speed, reduce costs and improve the predictability of our clients' data modernization journeys. Today, we have over 225 project implementations supporting over 120 clients. And our Flowsource platform, which is a developer workbench that is integrating human and AI effort to improve productivity. Today, we are in various phases of testing and adoption with more than 150 clients. Using AI tooling, we are generating 150,000 lines of accepted core per month. That means an annualized basis, 2 million lines of code are accepted by our developers into the projects to deliver to our clients. It's a great example of how AI is enabling hyper productivity as we share these productivity gains with clients and lower the cost of technology deployment. Our Neuro IT Ops platform launched in late 2023 is also supporting 150 clients in various phases of testing and adoption. It enables end-to-end AI-driven automation for IT operations, bringing Ops and infrastructure in a single pane of glass. As an example, we are leveraging both our Neuro IT Ops and Flowsource platforms together with a strategic project for DIRECTV to modernize its technology infrastructure and enhance its operational capabilities. Neuro IT Ops is helping DIRECTV increase efficiency and resiliency through intelligent detection and automated IT issue resolution. And Flowsource is scaling GenAI across DIRECTV software development life cycle, promoting innovation through faster time to market, increased collaboration and greater transparency. We've recently introduced two new additions to our Neuro suite. First, our enhanced Neuro AI platform incorporates market orchestration, aims to help enterprises by simplifying problem identification, data generation and AI model creation and improving decision-making and revenue opportunities. Clients like Gilead Sciences appraised its approach, while others like Bayer have tested several foundational capabilities, now available on the platform. These enhancements aim to help our clients to navigate complex decision-making scenarios effectively. Second, Cognizant Neuro Cybersecurity offers AI-enabled enterprise security orchestration for enhanced cyber resilience risk management. This tool is designed to help improve cyber security resilience by integrating and orchestrating point cybersecurity solutions across the enterprise. We have also infused AI through our TriZetto product suite, helping improve end user productivity by at least 30%. Looking across our enterprise, we now have more than 1,000 GenAI early engagements compared to about 750 at the end of the second quarter. We are seeing significant traction in four categories of use cases starting with tech for tech or applying AI to software development cycles, which had the highest velocity, followed by customer and employee experience, content aggregation and early use cases in content generation. We see broad-based demand across industries, including fraud detection, credit risk assessment and regulatory compliance in financial services. Drug discovery, medical imaging and transcription and health care and design optimization and predictive maintenance manufacturing. Partnerships and strategic acquisitions are also important levers in our strategy to accelerate growth. First an update on our partnerships. I'm excited about our recently announced relationship with Palo Alto Networks through, which we will deliver AI-driven cybersecurity capabilities and services for enterprises across industries. We significant opportunities to leverage AI to keep with evolving cybersecurity threats and improve overall levels of security. This last week, ServiceNow announced that Cognizant will be the first system integrator to bring its new workflow data fabric to market, giving our joint customers the capability to integrate AI agents and real-time data orchestration layers that can be tightly integrated to their digital workflows. We also announced an expansion of our NVIDIA partnership, bringing together our capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s RAPIDS, part of the NVIDIA AI software platform to enhance data modernization offering. Together, we aim to help clients transition to GPU-based infrastructure and accelerate the implementation of exciting new GenAI use cases. And earlier this week, we strengthened our partnership with Amazon Web Services by signing a strategic collaboration agreement with plans to deliver advanced technology solutions and cloud computing services focused on enhancing smart manufacturing capabilities for global enterprises across multiple industries. Turning to our strategic acquisitions. Thirdera acquired earlier this year positioned us as one of the world's largest ServiceNow partners and as a leader in AI-driven automation and enterprise workflow solutions. And our acquisition of Belcan has significantly broadened our access to the $190 billion ER&D services market, which is projected to outpace the legacy IT services market through 2026. Additionally, it has notably increased our footprint in the aerospace and defense industries with an attractive blue-chip client base. I'm happy to report that our commercial integration is progressing well. We have already seen early pipeline opportunities and identified the potential for new joint offerings in areas such as model-based systems engineering where Belcan has significant expertise. We believe these actions to accelerate growth are resonating in the market. Let me share a few additional highlights of the value we are bringing to our customers across industries. Within Financial Services, we continue to see traction from the changes in investments we have made over the last 20 months. We are bringing the breadth and depth of our capabilities to every opportunity. For example, we are supporting Citizen Bank's ongoing cloud transformation journey. We have collaborated with citizens to revamp their fraud management capabilities with a new in-the-house system. And we are helping citizens elevate their customer banking experience with a modernized system that streamlines dispute resolution. In the UK, we continued to see success winning in the public sector. During the third quarter, we expanded our relationships with the UK Valuation Office Agency of His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. This was one of a greater than $100 million contract signed in the quarter. Under the agreement, we'll provide the UK government with property valuations and advice needed to support taxation and benefits. And clients are still looking to drive productivity and underwrite future innovation. For example, we won a significant $200 million deal in the third quarter with a longstanding global technology client to transform the customer support operations using GenAI. This was a vendor consolidation opportunity where we leveraged GenAI to streamline operations, improve agent productivity and reduce costs. A differentiated AI-led approach, which included elements of outcome-based pricing allowed us to displace the incumbent. Now moving on to our next strategic priority of becoming the employer of choice in our industry. We believe our investments in talent are bearing fruit as well. We're adding more access to learning and upskilling, notably through AI in an effort to boost mobility and demonstrate that we are in an organization where our employees can grow. Our grassroots innovation initiative, Bluebolt continues to build traction with more than 300,000 ideas, of which 40,000 ideas, mostly related to AI are being presented to clients. Employee engagement scores stayed strong. Trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for tech services is at 14.6%, near multiyear lows. And we are -- we were recently named for the second straight year to Forbes list of world's best employers. Our Synapse program, which aims to provide technology training to nearly 1 million people worldwide is another great example of a deep commitment to learning. I was delighted when Fortune named us as the number seven in the world on its prestigious change the well list while recognizing the impact of Synapse. Just last week, we were named number 10 on Newsweek's list of America's most reliable companies. This recognition based on the independent survey of more than 1,700 decision-makers highlights our exceptional reliability in delivering services to our clients. We are confident that our expanded breadth of portfolio of services, strengthened by our domain capabilities, talent and partner ecosystem is more resilient and healthier than when I joined Cognizant nearly two years ago. And I believe we are in a strong position to capture the growing and developing AI opportunity for ourselves and our clients. In closing, a few weeks ago, we brought together over 200 clients to our to our Americas discovery event in Austin, Texas showcase the strength of AI platforms, capabilities and offerings. The events buzz and enthusiasm was incredible. We were excited about the early momentum of large deals with AI-powered productivity and numerous initial products. Our belief is the AI productivity way will evolve from task automation to business process to business model transformation, leading to new products and revenue streams and faster innovation cycles, a flywheel of new opportunities to tap into. I want to thank all our employees globally for their commitment to our clients and the work to strengthen our capabilities for the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Jatin, who will cover the details of the quarter and progress against our third strategic priority of modernizing operations.\nJatin Dalal: Thank you, Ravi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered a solid third quarter performance with revenue at the high end of our constant currency growth guidance range and a return to organic year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in six quarters. During the quarter, we continue to focus on modernizing our operations. This helped us increase gross margin by 50 basis points sequentially, driven by improved utilization and increased adoption of automation and AI within delivery. This allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, which modestly exceeded our expectations despite headwinds from acquisition elated costs and a partial quarter impact from our annual merit cycle that became effective on August 1st. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-over-year. Now let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue was $5 billion, growing 3.5% sequentially in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from about five weeks of Belcan. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2.7% in constant currency. This included approximately 200 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. From an industry standpoint, Health Sciences was our strongest segment, growing 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth here was broad-based across payer, provider and life sciences. On the payer and provider side, clients continue to seek our TriZetto platform solutions for modern scalable cloud solutions. In particular, our offering has seen healthy demand for its delivery of true end-to-end revenue cycle management, including clearing house services. On the Life Sciences side, growth has been supported by the ramp-up of recent large deal wins. Our Financial Services segment grew 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This performance added to last quarter's momentum and benefited from an uptick in the discretionary demand environment and better execution. Growth was led by banking and financial services clients in North America. In Canada, we have seen strong performance across both banking and insurance customers. Products and Resources revenue grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by the contribution of Belcan. We have seen pockets of discretionary weakness with clients in manufacturing, logistics, aerospace and automotive industries. We are sharply focused on grid modernization, software defined vehicles and smart manufacturing. This area, we believe will drive significant opportunity in the long run. CMT declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, primarily reflecting a continued tight discretionary spending environment across customers in both technology and telecom and media. Moving on to the details by geography, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Growth in the third quarter was led by Americas geography, which increased about 4%. This was driven by the strength in Financial Services and Health Sciences and the contribution from Belcan. Europe declined about 2% and has been impacted by software discretionary spending. However, recent wins in our largest segments helped support positive sequential growth in Europe. And we are optimistic about the growth opportunity we see in areas like UK and Ireland, Germany the Nordics. We delivered healthy growth in our Rest of the World region, which increased about 4%. Performance in this geography was driven by recent large deals, particularly within comms, media and technology and strength in financial services. Turning to bookings. Third quarter bookings were roughly flat year-over-year, driven in part by the lumpiness of large deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year and represented a 1.3x book-to-bill. As Ravi mentioned, we signed six deals in the quarter that each had a TCV value of more than $100 million. This included four deals in Health Sciences, one in financial services and one in CMT. I am also pleased that two of these six deals were from outside North America, one each in Europe and rest of all. We also saw TCV from smaller deals stabilized sequentially. This has led to a modest improvement in our trailing 12-month annual contract value trend from last quarter. We are seeing this reflected in our improved revenue performance this quarter despite muted TCV performance. Now moving on to margins. In the third quarter, we incurred $33 million of costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 70 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. Our sequential improvement was driven by gross margin, which expanded approximately 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We delivered this through operational rigor, improved utilization and corresponding lower bench costs. We are also making progress in modernizing our operations, increasingly leveraging our AI platforms in delivery to help improve fulfillment and increase productivity with fewer resources. In Q3, our GAAP tax rate was 22.7%, and adjusted tax rate was 22.2%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.17 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.25. This represented year-over-year growth of 13% and 7%, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2 billion or net cash of about $800 million. This reflects our $1.3 billion acquisition of Belcan in the third quarter, which was funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credibility. DSO of 81 days was one day up sequentially and increased four days year-over-year driven by our business mix. Free cash flow of Q3 was $791 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1 billion. There is no change to our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to represent about 80% of the net income. This includes previously disclosed negative impact from $360 million payment made to the Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter in the first quarter. During the quarter, we returned $391 million to shareholders, including $242 million in aggregate through share repurchases and $149 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. As of September 30th, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we now expect to return approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $100 million of share repurchases to offset the new shares issued as part of the Belcan acquisition. Turning now to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to increase 4.8% to 6.8% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 7.1%. This guidance reflects the benefit of full quarter of Belcan, partially offset by year-end seasonality, including the impact of lower builders and furloughs. For the full year, we have tightened the revenue range and maintained the midpoint. We now expect revenue to grow 1.4% to 1.9% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $19.7 billion to $19.8 billion, representing growth of 1.6% to 2.1%. Our output includes approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution, unchanged from our prior assumption. As Ravi mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Belcan in late August. There are no changes to the financial projections we shared at the time of acquisition announcement in June. We anticipate the transaction will generate over $100 million in annual revenue synergies within three years and be accretive to EPS starting in full year 2026. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin will be approximately 15.1%, which is the midpoint of our prior range. The fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be impacted by the full quarter impact of Belcan, including integration related costs, and the impact of non-cash amortization of acquired customer intangibles. It also will include the full quarter impact from our merit cycle that was effective August 1st. We expect these headwinds will be partially offset by continued rigor in operations and the savings associated with our NextGen program. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $65 million, which compares to $55 million previously, primarily reflecting the latest cash balance assumptions. Our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged. Our guidance for shares outstanding is also unchanged at approximately $497 million. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is $4.63 to $4.67, which is up from $4.56 to $4.64 previously. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question here is from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, guys. So just looking at the midpoint of Q4 guidance, our math suggests organic growth will be right around 2%. So I just wanted to check and see if that's right. And if so, is that a floor we can think about for Cognizant to accelerate off of in 2025, especially since it seems like you are starting to see a turn up in discretionary spending in your largest vertical? Thanks.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So I thought the upper end of the Y-on-Y quarter four was around 2%. So you're right that in quarter four, we are starting to build an organic Y-on-Y positive movement. I mean the midpoint is going to be 1% and the upper end is going to be 2%. So it's a good tail velocity to get into 2025.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. And then I wanted to come back to some of the comments around sharing savings from the AI-enabled coding efforts with your clients. What would you estimate the productivity improvement has been that you're seeing from those AI-enabled coding efforts? And what are the sort of offsets that you're seeing to avoid revenue cannibalization?\nRavi Kumar: Jason, this is a complicated economic and a complicated -- the response is going to be a little, I would say, complicated as well. Let me state how this works. When we have productivity, which is non-linear and not labor oriented, and it is new, you have an opportunity to go and tell your clients, if you have time and material business, we can translate that to fixed price business and share the better fit with them. If you have noticed, I mentioned about 2 million lines of code annually accepted by our developers. So that number is going to keep going up. So our ability to share those benefits with the clients actually makes us more competitive in the market. In fact, many of my clients have actually said, when you share these benefits and the cost of deployment goes down, we can take our backlog down, that's a very positive side. I mean clients are not saying because of productivity, we'll reduce our budgets. They're actually saying we want to do more for less. So that is a very positive indicator. It also gives us an opportunity to consolidate in places where our productivity is higher than our peers. We can actually -- we can offer a consolidation and, therefore, increase revenue throughput to us. One of the examples I mentioned in my remarks is about a client where we displaced an incumbent because we actually showed up with higher productivity. Now there is a third set, where you could arguably say clients -- it will cannibalize our revenue. But those are the times you want to be creative and you go back to clients and say, \"Look, the work packet we did, we could do it for less. But you know what, if we consolidate it, we actually do more for less,\" which then means you could protect your turf, but you could still stay the productivity benefits. Then there is a fourth set, which I would actually say is time and material work, where in some ways, the productivity benefits can generate value, but you have to work with your clients to move that work to fixed price. So I would actually believe this is a very positive development. There is elasticity in tech spend. So if you can reduce the cost of deployment, clients are actually going to spend more with you. And we believe we are ahead of the curve in comparison to all our peers. And that's why we're winning more large deals and we are able to protect our tough.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, Ravi.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, here. I want to ask on the large deal pipeline, considering you signed quite a bit here year-to-date more than last year, your confidence in being able to replenish the large deal pipeline from here, Ravi? .\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So last year, we did 17 for the full year, $100 million deals, more than $100 million deals. This year, we are already at 19, more than $100 million deals. I'm very confident that we can sustain the momentum. The way to sustain this is not just look for transformation opportunities where the spend goes up, but also look for cost takeout efficiency and vendor consolidation opportunities. Similar to what I mentioned in my previous response, there's always an opportunity to consolidate using productivity. So we are excited about it. I think we have to \u2013 we are starting to see now large deals in Europe and Asia Pacific. In fact, out of the six deals we did this quarter, one of them was in Asia Pacific, one of them was in Europe, and we had similar large deal in Asia Pacific last quarter as well. So we can expand. I mean this is also concentrated in a few industries. Now we are stepping up and taking a broader view of other industry. So the expansion will come from more industries. The expansion will come from going beyond Americas, which has already started happening. And the expansion will come from also our services landscape. Two years ago, a lot of our work was related to tech services and BPO. Now we have tech services, BPO, engineering because of the Belcan acquisition and some of the acquisitions we did before. We are now a top five player in engineering services. And interestingly, we are getting quite a bit of traction on infrastructure services, which we historically not having those many large deals. So right now, all four capability sets are firing cylinders. So I'm very confident about how we can sustain the large deal momentum.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, that's great. That's good color. It actually segues nicely into my follow-up question because I know one of your objectives was to diversify. You just mentioned you're doing that geographically and across some of your practices. But healthcare is now your largest vertical looks like, which is so used to seeing BFSI being the biggest recognizant. But where are you in the journey now to expand into some of other under indexed verticals. Is that still a priority? Can we expect that to come? Or is it more work to do on what we discussed before?\nRavi Kumar: No, that's a great question. I would say if you look at our revenue mix and the momentum we have, I mean, look at healthcare, we have grown 7.6% Y-o-Y. Both sequentially, we've grown and we have grown Y-on-Y. So we are very excited about the opportunities in healthcare, the differentiation we have and the lead we have in some of the areas is unmatched. So healthcare, we are very confident. Financial services, we are back on track. I mean, this is the -- this quarter -- last quarter, we did sequential growth. This quarter, we have done Y-on-Y growth and sequential growth. So again, financial services has a very different muscle. I think we have now stabilized, and we do believe that we are winning the wallet share there. We now have, I would believe, a unique opportunity in industrial and manufacturing with Belcan in the mix. And that's because they have -- we have access to blue-chip clients in aerospace. We have that capability set in engineering, which gives us a chance to go into industrial and manufacturing and automotive. It is a sector where we do believe we are now going to build a muscle to win deals, large deals. And I think we have a breadth of capability way from engineering services to tech services. The vertical comps, which if you have noticed, there has been a lower pace of spend in comps. But as that picks up, I think we have put a good team to get that moving. Where we have to make progress on is energy oil and gas, where we have a much lower presence. And that's something I'm going to work on. So the idea of the last two years, what we have essentially done is we've created a breadth of capability all the way from engineering, BPO, technology services and infrastructure services. We have created now more expansive opportunities on industries. I have work to do on international markets outside the US. But very pleased with the progress we've made so far because this expansive -- the strategy of expansion has helped us to keep the sustained momentum on our large deals.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you for the complete answer there. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the momentum in healthcare, you just talked about earlier. So maybe to follow up on the last question. Maybe as you think about your backlog of business for 2025. Obviously, you're not providing guidance now, but can you maybe tell us directionally which verticals do you think might outperform your overall corporate revenue growth in 2025? And then which ones might lag a little bit?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So Jim, as we look at the deal wins and -- the momentum that we have built, certainly financial services and healthcare will continue to lead the growth of the company. We have to build back momentum that we had all through 2023 in CMT, Comps Media and Telecom, as we get into next year. And manufacturing has been slow, but one hopes that, that should also come through. So I think that is the order, Jim, for us to look at who would lead the growth as we look at next few quarters.\nJim Schneider: Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up. It was good to see the gross margin leverage you delivered in the quarter. You mentioned part of that is utilization, but also part of it was AI, as you mentioned in the quarter. Can you maybe just help us on a go-forward basis into Q4? And then 2025 with sort of the moving pieces of gross margins, how much of those gains are sustainable? And what should we think about in terms of the mix of Belcan in Q4 and beyond in terms of where gross margins should land?\nRavi Kumar: Sure, Jim. So let me start with Belcan because that's easier to get out of the way. I think Belcan will not have a material movement on the gross margin number of the company they operate at a similar sort of range. So we should be okay. There should not be any noise from that. Now from a classic gross margin standpoint, the levers are utilization, automation and productivity led by AI is another one. Pyramid is the third one and the fourth is really the pricing. So I would say these are the four most or largest rivers. The fifth is offshore mix, but offshore mix, typically tends to be driven more by the requirements of our customers in time and material business. And only in the fixed-price projects, we have more flexibility around offshore. So I would count sort of four big ones and fifth on, which can be leveraged in specific situations. So -- as we look at the performance of this year, certainly utilization has continued to inch up every quarter. And I think we still have some flex left as we enter quarter four. Automation, led by AI is a tremendous opportunity. We have executed well in 2024, and I still feel we'll continue to get additional leverage of that as we build a greater rollout capability, greater absorption capability of that within our delivery -- within our spectrum of our delivery. The Pyramid is certainly an ongoing initiative. We have had, as an organization and as an industry struggle to keep up with the reason of Pyramid, all through 2020, 2021, 2022 as the industry went through a shock of a sudden drop of demand and then sudden increase in demand I think we are getting back to that rhythm of building Pyramids. So I would say it is not a lever for 2025, but it certainly is a lever as we look at next three years and that we are putting a great internal initiative around. And finally, pricing. Pricing in the current environment is, I would say, competitive. It's not something that is adding to gross margin today, but it is a factor of the demand environment. So that's how I see it.\nJim Schneider: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Maggie Nolan from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMaggie Nolan: Hi, thank you. Do you view financial services as leading in terms of how IT spend may trend across your business and end markets? Or do you view the dynamics of the financial services performance to be more vertical specific and Cognizant specific at this time?\nRavi Kumar: We're very pleased with how we have gone about structurally turning around our financial services business. When I came on board, we had both company-specific issues and market-specific issues. I'd say the company-specific issues have more or less gone. They have gone at least a few quarters ago. We put a good team on board now very stable team. We now have compelling offerings, and we are working the corridors of our clients. So we are starting to see the wallet share gain for ourselves. There is uptick in spending in financial services clients, and we are probably seizing those dollars of our peers, and therefore, we are starting to see that. I am very optimistic that financial services will continue to go back to a high discretionary environment at some point in time because it's also one of the most cutting-edge innovative industries. And they all have retailed organizations where a lot of technology innovation is done in partnership with companies like ours. We always had that muscle before. I mean, we were one of the leading financial services players across the world, and it does -- I do believe that we have got that module back. So depending on how the market turns around in financial services, we will grab those opportunities. We do not have any specific company-specific challenges which we had in the past. So that gives me the confidence that we have the differentiation, the agility, the team and as the market keeps bouncing back. I mean there is a rebound of discretionary dollars in financial services. And as that continues to go up. We are in a great start to gain more wallet share.\nMaggie Nolan: Okay. Thank you. And then any changes that you're seeing in the sales cycle and the conversion rate, both for this quarter that you just reported? And then also your forward expectations just given that continued large deal traction, but also what appears to be the early return of some the smaller discretionary deals and demand?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. The smaller discretionary deals have started to take a little momentum. So -- on the large deals, I would say the biggest change I have seen in the last few months is -- if we are able to put a proposal on the table where you can feed to the legacy, make savings, underwrite those savings for innovation. Our clients love that flywheel. So times are not saying I'm going to spend more. But try times are saying, can you do more for less. So the AI tooling is helping us do more for less. And those savings are getting translated to innovation dollars and translate it to backlog getting cleared. I think that is a new -- it's a new model which is helping us to win those deals. I mean, when we win these large deals, those dollars are not going back elsewhere, they're actually going back to technology. And we are able to put a model where we underwrite those dollars for the innovation. So that's the change. That's what clients are looking for in an industry of this kind where you can do more for less, the spend is elastic. I mean, you can -- if you do more or less the spend, you could get more done, and therefore, clients are going to get for you more. That's because the spend is elastic. You get more value, you get more projects to be done.\nMaggie Nolan: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nJamie Friedman: Thank you. So I wanted to ask briefly on your view of the durability of the Health Science recovery. Ravi, results speak for themselves. It's a very -- this is a clear turnaround. But we're getting a lot of questions that the end market seems to be volatile. And if you could unpack that maybe to the payer and Life Science side, but how do you see the changes in the end market, especially on the payer side potentially impacting the demand for your services?\nRavi Kumar: It's a great question. There are four segments here, there is payer provider, pharma benefit and Life Sciences. Life Sciences clearly is a standout because Life Sciences clients are no longer using technology for enabling their business, they're using technology at the core. And we have some extraordinary capability of partnering with our clients for that core business. This is not enabling the business I mean enabling the business is IT systems, enabling the core as their discovery cycles, the drug discovery cycles and the ability to apply technology to support it. We have really some very good capability there, including Life Sciences manufacturing. So I think that's a sector which we'll continue to invest in technology to reduce the drug development cycle, and we think we have a good opportunity there. On payer, as you would have noticed, there's a lot of cost takeout, which is going to happen because the PMPM as I call it, the cost per member per month that is under pressure. So you have to start to think about how do payers reduce their cost and increase the value towards care. So we think technology can be that enable us to reduce cost. Just to give you an example, on TriZetto, we applied Generative AI. And we are able to take out 30% cost for case managers and end users who are processing claims. The administrative costs and payers are so high that you produce technology and you could use the power of AI to create more -- generate more value, more straight through processing. Our auto adjudication on claims has significantly gone up. I mean we could auto adjudicate claims without human intervention. So there is so much happening on the payer side on technology that it's a cost takeout opportunity rather than anything else. Cost is going to lead to transformation of payer. Provider a very distributed market, and there is consolidation happening on providers. And I think we have, again, a unique opportunity because our TriZetto platform today has a large pool of providers. In fact, we have 200 million members, and we have thousands of providers who are on our platform. We also do Clearing House, which is a combination of payer and provider because the Clearing House actually sits on the gateways between providers and payers. Pharma benefit companies, very small number and they are themselves going to transformation. So is there going to there going to be more consolidation? Is there going to be more change? Is there going to be more transformation in this sector? Yes, but they're all going to be powered by technology. So we think our unique position in healthcare, our unique edition in healthcare is going to be a huge benefit for the opportunities which come out where. So I'm excited about the transformation in that entire value chain, which is going to happen in the next few years.\nJamie Friedman: Okay. Great answer. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Keane: Hi. Hey, Ravi, to me, it sounds like you're using GenAI as an advantage to come in and price below some of the peers using you guys' expertise in the technology to replace some incumbents and pass on some productivity gains. Is that fair?\nRavi Kumar: Yes. I know Yes. If the engagement model allows us to do that, we could share those benefits with our clients. In the past, it was labor-led the labor-led cycles are pretty much -- I mean, we have really optimized it across the industry. The new cycles are technology-led. And AI-led and automation-led productivity sharing the benefit to clients, I think, is a mainstream model which we are adapting to win these large deals where we have had sustained momentum.\nBryan Keane: Yes, because the argument will be that it's a deflationary environment for the overall IT services adds more of the cost save productivity in GenAI gets passed on, the old time and materials models come under pressure and the yields are lower. The outcomes-based pricing is going to yield the outcome for the contracts. So it's got a deflationary impact. So you've got to make it up by volume is the only way you can make faster growth.\nRavi Kumar: Yes. So my thesis there is almost every CIO, I have spoken about has actually said, they have a backlog, which they want to clear. And this is our opportunity to clear backlog. There are CIOs who have actually told us that, look, there is so much technical debt sitting with us. I mean there is a report which talks about $1 trillion of technical debt in US balance sheets -- American Corporation balance sheets. Almost $400 billion is actually being spent on again, another report which talks about spent on servicing the debt. And because of that, a lot of money is being spent on the run versus the bid. So this is our opportunity to readjust the run in the bid. So -- and that's what I was referring to earlier. We were able to reduce the run costs and transfer that to the bid, you can actually build more stuff. So technology spend is so elastic that -- I mean it will remain elastic because it is such a transformational tool that you could -- if you do more for less, you're actually going to get more to do because there is no -- the headroom is so high. So I actually believe that the thesis of doing more for less is only going to generate more opportunities for us.\nBryan Keane: And is it roughly 20% to 40% less or how much more or less is it?\nRavi Kumar: Yes, it's a hard put a number because it depends on the phase of the technology cycle. If it's pure play development, it is much higher. If it's testing, it is much higher. Equally, if you're in a fiercely competitive situation, you probably give it away to \u2013 you partially give it away to clients. There's also the maturity of the client, which kind of determines how much you can get productivity. So there is a compelling proposition to do fixed price and managed services deals. But there are always companies which have huge retained organizations, and they use companies like us to engage on a time and material or a capacity-based because they have strategically taken a call to build their own tech shop. In fact, we are actually helping some of those clients to build the tech shop. There are captives being set in India. We are actually a pioneering partner to partner with our clients to set up their captives. Another opportunity which has kind of evolved in the last one year. And again, I'm excited about it. I don't see that as cannibalization. I see that as an opportunity to stay more relevant with them.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: The last question is from Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Thank you. I do have a follow-up question here on the forward view. If you're targeting kind of an organic exit rate of about 1% of the midpoint, and flattish bookings here when we consider the year ahead, are there puts and takes about the conversion of the multiyear larger deals versus some of the smaller deals picking up to support the near-term growth reacceleration. Just any thoughts you want to share directionally about growth considerations as we get closer to 2025?\nRavi Kumar: Sure. So if you see this year, every quarter, we have been able to execute to the growth agenda that we set in the beginning of the quarter. This is first quarter, quarter three was our first quarter of organic growth in -- over the last few quarters. We are exiting with a significantly better velocity than what we had at the end 2023. So that certainly sets up well. But we will -- I think it's -- what is critical for us is really focus and execute well to quarter four, and then look at the opportunity that presents us in beginning of 2025 and then guide for 2025. So I would say little early to talk about 2025, but quite happy with the progress that we are making every quarter in -- on the trajectory.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. And then when we think about the margin levers, specifically on utilization. Do you have a targeted optimal level for you as you manage the bench, so you've gotten 84%. Can you lean on that more until demand recovers? Or is that an upper bound as you think about utilization?\nRavi Kumar: I do think there is a little more flat left on that, certainly, that I see, but not a lot more.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. This also concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you again for your participation.",

            "name": "Jatin Dalal",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered a solid third quarter performance with revenue at the high end of our constant currency growth guidance range and a return to organic year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in six quarters. During the quarter, we continue to focus on modernizing our operations. This helped us increase gross margin by 50 basis points sequentially, driven by improved utilization and increased adoption of automation and AI within delivery. This allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, which modestly exceeded our expectations despite headwinds from acquisition elated costs and a partial quarter impact from our annual merit cycle that became effective on August 1st. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-over-year. Now let's turn to the details. Third quarter revenue was $5 billion, growing 3.5% sequentially in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from about five weeks of Belcan. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2.7% in constant currency. This included approximately 200 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. From an industry standpoint, Health Sciences was our strongest segment, growing 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Growth here was broad-based across payer, provider and life sciences. On the payer and provider side, clients continue to seek our TriZetto platform solutions for modern scalable cloud solutions. In particular, our offering has seen healthy demand for its delivery of true end-to-end revenue cycle management, including clearing house services. On the Life Sciences side, growth has been supported by the ramp-up of recent large deal wins. Our Financial Services segment grew 0.5% year-over-year in constant currency. This performance added to last quarter's momentum and benefited from an uptick in the discretionary demand environment and better execution. Growth was led by banking and financial services clients in North America. In Canada, we have seen strong performance across both banking and insurance customers. Products and Resources revenue grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by the contribution of Belcan. We have seen pockets of discretionary weakness with clients in manufacturing, logistics, aerospace and automotive industries. We are sharply focused on grid modernization, software defined vehicles and smart manufacturing. This area, we believe will drive significant opportunity in the long run. CMT declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency, primarily reflecting a continued tight discretionary spending environment across customers in both technology and telecom and media. Moving on to the details by geography, where all growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Growth in the third quarter was led by Americas geography, which increased about 4%. This was driven by the strength in Financial Services and Health Sciences and the contribution from Belcan. Europe declined about 2% and has been impacted by software discretionary spending. However, recent wins in our largest segments helped support positive sequential growth in Europe. And we are optimistic about the growth opportunity we see in areas like UK and Ireland, Germany the Nordics. We delivered healthy growth in our Rest of the World region, which increased about 4%. Performance in this geography was driven by recent large deals, particularly within comms, media and technology and strength in financial services. Turning to bookings. Third quarter bookings were roughly flat year-over-year, driven in part by the lumpiness of large deals. On a trailing 12-month basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year and represented a 1.3x book-to-bill. As Ravi mentioned, we signed six deals in the quarter that each had a TCV value of more than $100 million. This included four deals in Health Sciences, one in financial services and one in CMT. I am also pleased that two of these six deals were from outside North America, one each in Europe and rest of all. We also saw TCV from smaller deals stabilized sequentially. This has led to a modest improvement in our trailing 12-month annual contract value trend from last quarter. We are seeing this reflected in our improved revenue performance this quarter despite muted TCV performance. Now moving on to margins. In the third quarter, we incurred $33 million of costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 70 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 15.3%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and a decrease of 20 basis points year-over-year. Our sequential improvement was driven by gross margin, which expanded approximately 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We delivered this through operational rigor, improved utilization and corresponding lower bench costs. We are also making progress in modernizing our operations, increasingly leveraging our AI platforms in delivery to help improve fulfillment and increase productivity with fewer resources. In Q3, our GAAP tax rate was 22.7%, and adjusted tax rate was 22.2%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q3 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.17 and Q3 adjusted EPS was $1.25. This represented year-over-year growth of 13% and 7%, respectively. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2 billion or net cash of about $800 million. This reflects our $1.3 billion acquisition of Belcan in the third quarter, which was funded primarily through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credibility. DSO of 81 days was one day up sequentially and increased four days year-over-year driven by our business mix. Free cash flow of Q3 was $791 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $1 billion. There is no change to our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We continue to expect full year free cash flow to represent about 80% of the net income. This includes previously disclosed negative impact from $360 million payment made to the Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter in the first quarter. During the quarter, we returned $391 million to shareholders, including $242 million in aggregate through share repurchases and $149 million to shareholders through our regular dividend. As of September 30th, we had $1.4 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we now expect to return approximately $1.2 billion. This includes approximately $100 million of share repurchases to offset the new shares issued as part of the Belcan acquisition. Turning now to our forward outlook. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to increase 4.8% to 6.8% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 5.1% to 7.1%. This guidance reflects the benefit of full quarter of Belcan, partially offset by year-end seasonality, including the impact of lower builders and furloughs. For the full year, we have tightened the revenue range and maintained the midpoint. We now expect revenue to grow 1.4% to 1.9% in constant currency. On and as reported basis, this translates to revenue of $19.7 billion to $19.8 billion, representing growth of 1.6% to 2.1%. Our output includes approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution, unchanged from our prior assumption. As Ravi mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Belcan in late August. There are no changes to the financial projections we shared at the time of acquisition announcement in June. We anticipate the transaction will generate over $100 million in annual revenue synergies within three years and be accretive to EPS starting in full year 2026. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin will be approximately 15.1%, which is the midpoint of our prior range. The fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be impacted by the full quarter impact of Belcan, including integration related costs, and the impact of non-cash amortization of acquired customer intangibles. It also will include the full quarter impact from our merit cycle that was effective August 1st. We expect these headwinds will be partially offset by continued rigor in operations and the savings associated with our NextGen program. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $65 million, which compares to $55 million previously, primarily reflecting the latest cash balance assumptions. Our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% is unchanged. Our guidance for shares outstanding is also unchanged at approximately $497 million. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is $4.63 to $4.67, which is up from $4.56 to $4.64 previously. With that, we will open the call for your questions."

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which delivered revenue and earnings growth while expanding adjusted margins sequentially and represented strong execution of our strategic priorities to accelerate growth, become an employer of choice in our industry and modernize operations. We are seeing a gradual rebound of spend cycles and gaining wallet share in financial services. While our historical strength in health sciences is driving differentiation and growth. Meanwhile, a significant traction with large deals and AI-led revenue opportunities, investments in talent and a steadfast focus on operational rigor together led to a strong all-round performance. Let me begin with a quick summary of our results before an update on our strategic priorities. Third quarter revenue was at the high end of our constant currency guidance range. Revenue of $5 billion grew 3.5% sequentially, in constant currency, including approximately 150 basis points of inorganic contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Year-over-year revenue grew by approximately 2.7% in constant currency, including approximately 200 basis points of inorganic contribution. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3% improved sequentially, driven by strong cost discipline despite investments in Belcan in the partial quarter impact from our annual minute cycle. Adjusted EPS grew approximately 7% year-over-year, our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, bringing our year-to-date EPS growth to approximately 5%. Now let me provide an update on the progress we made against our strategic priorities. First, accelerating growth. Our improving momentum was driven in the quarter by growth in our two largest segments, Health Sciences and Financial Services and contribution from our recently completed acquisitions. Health Sciences increased 7.6% year-over-year in constant currency backed by our strong differentiated offerings. Financial Services returned to year-over-year growth, driven by strong execution and partial return of discretionary spending. And we maintained our large deal momentum, signing six deals, each with a total contract value of $100 million or more. Year-to-date, we signed 19 sub deals compared to 17 during all of 2023. We are excited about the all-around sustained momentum in large deals across industries and service lines. I'm particularly pleased with the traction we are getting in digital engineering, infrastructure and cloud services. We believe in order to sustain this momentum, we must remain at the forefront of our clients' innovation agenda where today, AI is at the top of the list. Our heritage of deep engineering and strong domain expertise intimate client relationships and flexible operating model has allowed us to quickly respond to this opportunity. We have rapidly developed practical tools to help our clients accelerate AI adoption, while also applying it to ourselves as we aim to significantly accelerate our own productivity. AI is a profound shift, what I call a double engine transformation because it offers Cognizant the chance to disrupt ourselves as much as it does for our clients. Consistent with our heritage, we spotted the AI opportunity early and in mid-2023, announced plans to invest $1 billion into AI initiatives, platforms and capabilities. Let me share some examples, beginning with our platforms where our clients are co-creating with us. The foundation of our AI strategy is powered by the Cognizant data and toolkit, which we utilized to increase speed, reduce costs and improve the predictability of our clients' data modernization journeys. Today, we have over 225 project implementations supporting over 120 clients. And our Flowsource platform, which is a developer workbench that is integrating human and AI effort to improve productivity. Today, we are in various phases of testing and adoption with more than 150 clients. Using AI tooling, we are generating 150,000 lines of accepted core per month. That means an annualized basis, 2 million lines of code are accepted by our developers into the projects to deliver to our clients. It's a great example of how AI is enabling hyper productivity as we share these productivity gains with clients and lower the cost of technology deployment. Our Neuro IT Ops platform launched in late 2023 is also supporting 150 clients in various phases of testing and adoption. It enables end-to-end AI-driven automation for IT operations, bringing Ops and infrastructure in a single pane of glass. As an example, we are leveraging both our Neuro IT Ops and Flowsource platforms together with a strategic project for DIRECTV to modernize its technology infrastructure and enhance its operational capabilities. Neuro IT Ops is helping DIRECTV increase efficiency and resiliency through intelligent detection and automated IT issue resolution. And Flowsource is scaling GenAI across DIRECTV software development life cycle, promoting innovation through faster time to market, increased collaboration and greater transparency. We've recently introduced two new additions to our Neuro suite. First, our enhanced Neuro AI platform incorporates market orchestration, aims to help enterprises by simplifying problem identification, data generation and AI model creation and improving decision-making and revenue opportunities. Clients like Gilead Sciences appraised its approach, while others like Bayer have tested several foundational capabilities, now available on the platform. These enhancements aim to help our clients to navigate complex decision-making scenarios effectively. Second, Cognizant Neuro Cybersecurity offers AI-enabled enterprise security orchestration for enhanced cyber resilience risk management. This tool is designed to help improve cyber security resilience by integrating and orchestrating point cybersecurity solutions across the enterprise. We have also infused AI through our TriZetto product suite, helping improve end user productivity by at least 30%. Looking across our enterprise, we now have more than 1,000 GenAI early engagements compared to about 750 at the end of the second quarter. We are seeing significant traction in four categories of use cases starting with tech for tech or applying AI to software development cycles, which had the highest velocity, followed by customer and employee experience, content aggregation and early use cases in content generation. We see broad-based demand across industries, including fraud detection, credit risk assessment and regulatory compliance in financial services. Drug discovery, medical imaging and transcription and health care and design optimization and predictive maintenance manufacturing. Partnerships and strategic acquisitions are also important levers in our strategy to accelerate growth. First an update on our partnerships. I'm excited about our recently announced relationship with Palo Alto Networks through, which we will deliver AI-driven cybersecurity capabilities and services for enterprises across industries. We significant opportunities to leverage AI to keep with evolving cybersecurity threats and improve overall levels of security. This last week, ServiceNow announced that Cognizant will be the first system integrator to bring its new workflow data fabric to market, giving our joint customers the capability to integrate AI agents and real-time data orchestration layers that can be tightly integrated to their digital workflows. We also announced an expansion of our NVIDIA partnership, bringing together our capabilities with NVIDIA's RAPIDS, part of the NVIDIA AI software platform to enhance data modernization offering. Together, we aim to help clients transition to GPU-based infrastructure and accelerate the implementation of exciting new GenAI use cases. And earlier this week, we strengthened our partnership with Amazon Web Services by signing a strategic collaboration agreement with plans to deliver advanced technology solutions and cloud computing services focused on enhancing smart manufacturing capabilities for global enterprises across multiple industries. Turning to our strategic acquisitions. Thirdera acquired earlier this year positioned us as one of the world's largest ServiceNow partners and as a leader in AI-driven automation and enterprise workflow solutions. And our acquisition of Belcan has significantly broadened our access to the $190 billion ER&D services market, which is projected to outpace the legacy IT services market through 2026. Additionally, it has notably increased our footprint in the aerospace and defense industries with an attractive blue-chip client base. I'm happy to report that our commercial integration is progressing well. We have already seen early pipeline opportunities and identified the potential for new joint offerings in areas such as model-based systems engineering where Belcan has significant expertise. We believe these actions to accelerate growth are resonating in the market. Let me share a few additional highlights of the value we are bringing to our customers across industries. Within Financial Services, we continue to see traction from the changes in investments we have made over the last 20 months. We are bringing the breadth and depth of our capabilities to every opportunity. For example, we are supporting Citizen Bank's ongoing cloud transformation journey. We have collaborated with citizens to revamp their fraud management capabilities with a new in-the-house system. And we are helping citizens elevate their customer banking experience with a modernized system that streamlines dispute resolution. In the UK, we continued to see success winning in the public sector. During the third quarter, we expanded our relationships with the UK Valuation Office Agency of His Majesty's Revenue and Customs. This was one of a greater than $100 million contract signed in the quarter. Under the agreement, we'll provide the UK government with property valuations and advice needed to support taxation and benefits. And clients are still looking to drive productivity and underwrite future innovation. For example, we won a significant $200 million deal in the third quarter with a longstanding global technology client to transform the customer support operations using GenAI. This was a vendor consolidation opportunity where we leveraged GenAI to streamline operations, improve agent productivity and reduce costs. A differentiated AI-led approach, which included elements of outcome-based pricing allowed us to displace the incumbent. Now moving on to our next strategic priority of becoming the employer of choice in our industry. We believe our investments in talent are bearing fruit as well. We're adding more access to learning and upskilling, notably through AI in an effort to boost mobility and demonstrate that we are in an organization where our employees can grow. Our grassroots innovation initiative, Bluebolt continues to build traction with more than 300,000 ideas, of which 40,000 ideas, mostly related to AI are being presented to clients. Employee engagement scores stayed strong. Trailing 12 months voluntary attrition for tech services is at 14.6%, near multiyear lows. And we are -- we were recently named for the second straight year to Forbes list of world's best employers. Our Synapse program, which aims to provide technology training to nearly 1 million people worldwide is another great example of a deep commitment to learning. I was delighted when Fortune named us as the number seven in the world on its prestigious change the well list while recognizing the impact of Synapse. Just last week, we were named number 10 on Newsweek's list of America's most reliable companies. This recognition based on the independent survey of more than 1,700 decision-makers highlights our exceptional reliability in delivering services to our clients. We are confident that our expanded breadth of portfolio of services, strengthened by our domain capabilities, talent and partner ecosystem is more resilient and healthier than when I joined Cognizant nearly two years ago. And I believe we are in a strong position to capture the growing and developing AI opportunity for ourselves and our clients. In closing, a few weeks ago, we brought together over 200 clients to our to our Americas discovery event in Austin, Texas showcase the strength of AI platforms, capabilities and offerings. The events buzz and enthusiasm was incredible. We were excited about the early momentum of large deals with AI-powered productivity and numerous initial products. Our belief is the AI productivity way will evolve from task automation to business process to business model transformation, leading to new products and revenue streams and faster innovation cycles, a flywheel of new opportunities to tap into. I want to thank all our employees globally for their commitment to our clients and the work to strengthen our capabilities for the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Jatin, who will cover the details of the quarter and progress against our third strategic priority of modernizing operations. Yes. So I thought the upper end of the Y-on-Y quarter four was around 2%. So you're right that in quarter four, we are starting to build an organic Y-on-Y positive movement. I mean the midpoint is going to be 1% and the upper end is going to be 2%. So it's a good tail velocity to get into 2025. Jason, this is a complicated economic and a complicated -- the response is going to be a little, I would say, complicated as well. Let me state how this works. When we have productivity, which is non-linear and not labor oriented, and it is new, you have an opportunity to go and tell your clients, if you have time and material business, we can translate that to fixed price business and share the better fit with them. If you have noticed, I mentioned about 2 million lines of code annually accepted by our developers. So that number is going to keep going up. So our ability to share those benefits with the clients actually makes us more competitive in the market. In fact, many of my clients have actually said, when you share these benefits and the cost of deployment goes down, we can take our backlog down, that's a very positive side. I mean clients are not saying because of productivity, we'll reduce our budgets. They're actually saying we want to do more for less. So that is a very positive indicator. It also gives us an opportunity to consolidate in places where our productivity is higher than our peers. We can actually -- we can offer a consolidation and, therefore, increase revenue throughput to us. One of the examples I mentioned in my remarks is about a client where we displaced an incumbent because we actually showed up with higher productivity. Now there is a third set, where you could arguably say clients -- it will cannibalize our revenue. But those are the times you want to be creative and you go back to clients and say, \"Look, the work packet we did, we could do it for less. But you know what, if we consolidate it, we actually do more for less,\" which then means you could protect your turf, but you could still stay the productivity benefits. Then there is a fourth set, which I would actually say is time and material work, where in some ways, the productivity benefits can generate value, but you have to work with your clients to move that work to fixed price. So I would actually believe this is a very positive development. There is elasticity in tech spend. So if you can reduce the cost of deployment, clients are actually going to spend more with you. And we believe we are ahead of the curve in comparison to all our peers. And that's why we're winning more large deals and we are able to protect our tough. Yes. So last year, we did 17 for the full year, $100 million deals, more than $100 million deals. This year, we are already at 19, more than $100 million deals. I'm very confident that we can sustain the momentum. The way to sustain this is not just look for transformation opportunities where the spend goes up, but also look for cost takeout efficiency and vendor consolidation opportunities. Similar to what I mentioned in my previous response, there's always an opportunity to consolidate using productivity. So we are excited about it. I think we have to \u2013 we are starting to see now large deals in Europe and Asia Pacific. In fact, out of the six deals we did this quarter, one of them was in Asia Pacific, one of them was in Europe, and we had similar large deal in Asia Pacific last quarter as well. So we can expand. I mean this is also concentrated in a few industries. Now we are stepping up and taking a broader view of other industry. So the expansion will come from more industries. The expansion will come from going beyond Americas, which has already started happening. And the expansion will come from also our services landscape. Two years ago, a lot of our work was related to tech services and BPO. Now we have tech services, BPO, engineering because of the Belcan acquisition and some of the acquisitions we did before. We are now a top five player in engineering services. And interestingly, we are getting quite a bit of traction on infrastructure services, which we historically not having those many large deals. So right now, all four capability sets are firing cylinders. So I'm very confident about how we can sustain the large deal momentum. No, that's a great question. I would say if you look at our revenue mix and the momentum we have, I mean, look at healthcare, we have grown 7.6% Y-o-Y. Both sequentially, we've grown and we have grown Y-on-Y. So we are very excited about the opportunities in healthcare, the differentiation we have and the lead we have in some of the areas is unmatched. So healthcare, we are very confident. Financial services, we are back on track. I mean, this is the -- this quarter -- last quarter, we did sequential growth. This quarter, we have done Y-on-Y growth and sequential growth. So again, financial services has a very different muscle. I think we have now stabilized, and we do believe that we are winning the wallet share there. We now have, I would believe, a unique opportunity in industrial and manufacturing with Belcan in the mix. And that's because they have -- we have access to blue-chip clients in aerospace. We have that capability set in engineering, which gives us a chance to go into industrial and manufacturing and automotive. It is a sector where we do believe we are now going to build a muscle to win deals, large deals. And I think we have a breadth of capability way from engineering services to tech services. The vertical comps, which if you have noticed, there has been a lower pace of spend in comps. But as that picks up, I think we have put a good team to get that moving. Where we have to make progress on is energy oil and gas, where we have a much lower presence. And that's something I'm going to work on. So the idea of the last two years, what we have essentially done is we've created a breadth of capability all the way from engineering, BPO, technology services and infrastructure services. We have created now more expansive opportunities on industries. I have work to do on international markets outside the US. But very pleased with the progress we've made so far because this expansive -- the strategy of expansion has helped us to keep the sustained momentum on our large deals. Yes. So Jim, as we look at the deal wins and -- the momentum that we have built, certainly financial services and healthcare will continue to lead the growth of the company. We have to build back momentum that we had all through 2023 in CMT, Comps Media and Telecom, as we get into next year. And manufacturing has been slow, but one hopes that, that should also come through. So I think that is the order, Jim, for us to look at who would lead the growth as we look at next few quarters. Sure, Jim. So let me start with Belcan because that's easier to get out of the way. I think Belcan will not have a material movement on the gross margin number of the company they operate at a similar sort of range. So we should be okay. There should not be any noise from that. Now from a classic gross margin standpoint, the levers are utilization, automation and productivity led by AI is another one. Pyramid is the third one and the fourth is really the pricing. So I would say these are the four most or largest rivers. The fifth is offshore mix, but offshore mix, typically tends to be driven more by the requirements of our customers in time and material business. And only in the fixed-price projects, we have more flexibility around offshore. So I would count sort of four big ones and fifth on, which can be leveraged in specific situations. So -- as we look at the performance of this year, certainly utilization has continued to inch up every quarter. And I think we still have some flex left as we enter quarter four. Automation, led by AI is a tremendous opportunity. We have executed well in 2024, and I still feel we'll continue to get additional leverage of that as we build a greater rollout capability, greater absorption capability of that within our delivery -- within our spectrum of our delivery. The Pyramid is certainly an ongoing initiative. We have had, as an organization and as an industry struggle to keep up with the reason of Pyramid, all through 2020, 2021, 2022 as the industry went through a shock of a sudden drop of demand and then sudden increase in demand I think we are getting back to that rhythm of building Pyramids. So I would say it is not a lever for 2025, but it certainly is a lever as we look at next three years and that we are putting a great internal initiative around. And finally, pricing. Pricing in the current environment is, I would say, competitive. It's not something that is adding to gross margin today, but it is a factor of the demand environment. So that's how I see it. We're very pleased with how we have gone about structurally turning around our financial services business. When I came on board, we had both company-specific issues and market-specific issues. I'd say the company-specific issues have more or less gone. They have gone at least a few quarters ago. We put a good team on board now very stable team. We now have compelling offerings, and we are working the corridors of our clients. So we are starting to see the wallet share gain for ourselves. There is uptick in spending in financial services clients, and we are probably seizing those dollars of our peers, and therefore, we are starting to see that. I am very optimistic that financial services will continue to go back to a high discretionary environment at some point in time because it's also one of the most cutting-edge innovative industries. And they all have retailed organizations where a lot of technology innovation is done in partnership with companies like ours. We always had that muscle before. I mean, we were one of the leading financial services players across the world, and it does -- I do believe that we have got that module back. So depending on how the market turns around in financial services, we will grab those opportunities. We do not have any specific company-specific challenges which we had in the past. So that gives me the confidence that we have the differentiation, the agility, the team and as the market keeps bouncing back. I mean there is a rebound of discretionary dollars in financial services. And as that continues to go up. We are in a great start to gain more wallet share. Yes. The smaller discretionary deals have started to take a little momentum. So -- on the large deals, I would say the biggest change I have seen in the last few months is -- if we are able to put a proposal on the table where you can feed to the legacy, make savings, underwrite those savings for innovation. Our clients love that flywheel. So times are not saying I'm going to spend more. But try times are saying, can you do more for less. So the AI tooling is helping us do more for less. And those savings are getting translated to innovation dollars and translate it to backlog getting cleared. I think that is a new -- it's a new model which is helping us to win those deals. I mean, when we win these large deals, those dollars are not going back elsewhere, they're actually going back to technology. And we are able to put a model where we underwrite those dollars for the innovation. So that's the change. That's what clients are looking for in an industry of this kind where you can do more for less, the spend is elastic. I mean, you can -- if you do more or less the spend, you could get more done, and therefore, clients are going to get for you more. That's because the spend is elastic. You get more value, you get more projects to be done. It's a great question. There are four segments here, there is payer provider, pharma benefit and Life Sciences. Life Sciences clearly is a standout because Life Sciences clients are no longer using technology for enabling their business, they're using technology at the core. And we have some extraordinary capability of partnering with our clients for that core business. This is not enabling the business I mean enabling the business is IT systems, enabling the core as their discovery cycles, the drug discovery cycles and the ability to apply technology to support it. We have really some very good capability there, including Life Sciences manufacturing. So I think that's a sector which we'll continue to invest in technology to reduce the drug development cycle, and we think we have a good opportunity there. On payer, as you would have noticed, there's a lot of cost takeout, which is going to happen because the PMPM as I call it, the cost per member per month that is under pressure. So you have to start to think about how do payers reduce their cost and increase the value towards care. So we think technology can be that enable us to reduce cost. Just to give you an example, on TriZetto, we applied Generative AI. And we are able to take out 30% cost for case managers and end users who are processing claims. The administrative costs and payers are so high that you produce technology and you could use the power of AI to create more -- generate more value, more straight through processing. Our auto adjudication on claims has significantly gone up. I mean we could auto adjudicate claims without human intervention. So there is so much happening on the payer side on technology that it's a cost takeout opportunity rather than anything else. Cost is going to lead to transformation of payer. Provider a very distributed market, and there is consolidation happening on providers. And I think we have, again, a unique opportunity because our TriZetto platform today has a large pool of providers. In fact, we have 200 million members, and we have thousands of providers who are on our platform. We also do Clearing House, which is a combination of payer and provider because the Clearing House actually sits on the gateways between providers and payers. Pharma benefit companies, very small number and they are themselves going to transformation. So is there going to there going to be more consolidation? Is there going to be more change? Is there going to be more transformation in this sector? Yes, but they're all going to be powered by technology. So we think our unique position in healthcare, our unique edition in healthcare is going to be a huge benefit for the opportunities which come out where. So I'm excited about the transformation in that entire value chain, which is going to happen in the next few years. Yes. I know Yes. If the engagement model allows us to do that, we could share those benefits with our clients. In the past, it was labor-led the labor-led cycles are pretty much -- I mean, we have really optimized it across the industry. The new cycles are technology-led. And AI-led and automation-led productivity sharing the benefit to clients, I think, is a mainstream model which we are adapting to win these large deals where we have had sustained momentum. Yes. So my thesis there is almost every CIO, I have spoken about has actually said, they have a backlog, which they want to clear. And this is our opportunity to clear backlog. There are CIOs who have actually told us that, look, there is so much technical debt sitting with us. I mean there is a report which talks about $1 trillion of technical debt in US balance sheets -- American Corporation balance sheets. Almost $400 billion is actually being spent on again, another report which talks about spent on servicing the debt. And because of that, a lot of money is being spent on the run versus the bid. So this is our opportunity to readjust the run in the bid. So -- and that's what I was referring to earlier. We were able to reduce the run costs and transfer that to the bid, you can actually build more stuff. So technology spend is so elastic that -- I mean it will remain elastic because it is such a transformational tool that you could -- if you do more for less, you're actually going to get more to do because there is no -- the headroom is so high. So I actually believe that the thesis of doing more for less is only going to generate more opportunities for us. Yes, it's a hard put a number because it depends on the phase of the technology cycle. If it's pure play development, it is much higher. If it's testing, it is much higher. Equally, if you're in a fiercely competitive situation, you probably give it away to \u2013 you partially give it away to clients. There's also the maturity of the client, which kind of determines how much you can get productivity. So there is a compelling proposition to do fixed price and managed services deals. But there are always companies which have huge retained organizations, and they use companies like us to engage on a time and material or a capacity-based because they have strategically taken a call to build their own tech shop. In fact, we are actually helping some of those clients to build the tech shop. There are captives being set in India. We are actually a pioneering partner to partner with our clients to set up their captives. Another opportunity which has kind of evolved in the last one year. And again, I'm excited about it. I don't see that as cannibalization. I see that as an opportunity to stay more relevant with them. Sure. So if you see this year, every quarter, we have been able to execute to the growth agenda that we set in the beginning of the quarter. This is first quarter, quarter three was our first quarter of organic growth in -- over the last few quarters. We are exiting with a significantly better velocity than what we had at the end 2023. So that certainly sets up well. But we will -- I think it's -- what is critical for us is really focus and execute well to quarter four, and then look at the opportunity that presents us in beginning of 2025 and then guide for 2025. So I would say little early to talk about 2025, but quite happy with the progress that we are making every quarter in -- on the trajectory. I do think there is a little more flat left on that, certainly, that I see, but not a lot more."

We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, expanded our adjusted operating margin both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, sustained our large deal momentum by signing five deals each with total contract value of $100 million or more, and announced an agreement to acquire Belcan, which is expected to expand our ER&D capabilities, while diversifying into the high-growth aerospace and defense sectors. Although the demand environment remains challenging and clients' discretionary spending behavior is unchanged from recent quarters, we believe these results demonstrate our rigorous execution against the strategic priorities we set forth last year. Q2 revenue was $4.85 billion, which was $30 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 2.1% sequentially in constant currency. This was the highest quarter-over-quarter growth since 2022. With strong execution of our NextGen program and overall cost discipline, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for tech services was 13.6% compared to nearly 20% in the prior-year period. Second quarter bookings grew 5% year-over-year and, on a trailing 12-months basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, representing a 1.4x book-to-bill. In addition to the five deals each with TCV of over $100 million, we signed two deals that were above $90 million each. In the first half of this year, we have now signed 13 deals each with TCV of over $100 million, well ahead of our 2023 pace, which included 17 deals of this size for the entire year. From a segment perspective, we are especially pleased with Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially in constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas. Within Financial Services, our banking business posted a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth and returned to modest year-over-year growth in constant currency for the first time since Q2 of 2022. We are seeing demand being driven by client investments and hyper personalization, infrastructure and platform modernization. Our insurance sub-segment also grew sequentially in Q2, and one of the $500 million-plus TCV deals we signed this quarter was with a large American insurance provider. I believe these results reflect our actions to stabilize the BFSI business since last year. Over that period, we put new leadership in place and drove greater industry focus on this customer segments. We also aligned our go-to-market approach and launched industry-led service offerings in areas like real-time payment fraud detection, payments hub modernization and digital banking. Health Sciences grew by 3% sequentially in constant currency and we see a number of positive secular trends. For example, payers and providers remain focused on reducing the cost of care. We believe this is benefiting our TriZetto platform, where we are helping clients manage more than [$500 billion] (ph) in complex claims and improve patient outcomes. TriZetto's end-to-end capabilities are gaining traction as clients see the value of -- in our ability to provide both revenue cycle management and clearinghouse services. On the payer side, we're seeing demand being driven by data and cloud modernization as our clients seek to deliver a modern best-in-class consumer experience for the members. And in life sciences, clients have begun moving beyond cost optimization projects to once that accelerate their GenAI and digital transformation in R&D and continue to drive enterprise modernization with SAP S/4HANA. By region, we are very pleased with the performance in Americas, where revenue grew 2.8% sequentially and returned to growth year-over-year. I am extremely proud of the progress the team has made and I'm confident in our opportunities ahead. Looking back over the last 18 months, we believe our strategic investments and focus on improving our operational rigor has further strengthened a foundation on which we can drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. We invested in our leadership team and attracted new talent to the organization. We drove internal process improvements, particularly around large deals and our talent. And we focus sharply on strengthening our relevance with clients through investments in our innovation strategy and platform offerings. We believe these changes are starting to pay off and are reflected in our recent revenue performance and year-over-year operating margin expansion in the first half of this year. We have maintained our focus on becoming an employer of choice in our industry and we're recognized by the Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places to Work and Greatest Places for Job Starters. We also continue to expand our footprint in smaller cities in India with the opening of a newest office in Indore, as we remain committed to bringing offices closest to where our employees are. And I'm pleased with Bluebolt, our grassroots innovation program, which has generated 210,000 ideas by our associates since its inception last year. We're also hearing positive feedback from our customers through our project-level net promoter score, which I'm pleased to say has improved consistently since 2021 through the first half of 2024. This quarter marks our highest NPS to-date. We have taken a number of actions to-date to accelerate growth and drive operational improvements, and we look forward to continuing to update shareholders on our progress. To that end, we plan to provide an investor update in the first half of 2025 to discuss, among other things, our strategy, our differentiation in the market, our efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. A prime example of our investments in higher-growth industries and expanding capabilities is our agreements to acquire Belcan, a leading global supplier of engineering, research and development, or ER&D, services. We have seen growing demand in ER&D services, an estimated $190 billion market whose high growth has been fueled by the convergence of digital technology and the physical world. Over the last three years, we have strengthened our ER&D capabilities, starting with our 2021 acquisition of ESG Mobility, a digital automotive ER&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles. And at the start of my term last year, we acquired Mobica, which focuses on IoT-embedded software engineering capabilities from the chip to the cloud. We expect the Belcan acquisition to provide an opportunity for us to expand our service offerings into growth vectors that help move the physical world of manufacturing aerospace and automotive into the age of digital data and AI. Earlier this week, we introduced the next evolution of our experienced practice area called Cognizant Moment, which is a new integrated business within Cognizant that builds on our over 20 years of expertise and digital experience. Cognizant Moment will focus on next-generation experience services that are dynamic, data-led and AI-powered, harnessing the content generation and personalization power that generative AI brings, combined with human ingenuity, to help clients innovate, differentiate and grow. The creative and programmatic services lifecycle is expected to go through significant transformation in the years ahead, and we see an opportunity to disrupt the status quo agency model as creative content becomes increasingly generated and orchestrated by Gen AI-led models. Moving on to additional highlights from the quarter. We extended our relationship with Victory Capital to provide IT infrastructure and data analytics support. Over the next five years, we aim to provide this client with new service management capabilities, improved service productivity, opportunities for cost savings and the ability for Victory Capital to cost effectively scale in support of business growth. Additionally, we signed an agreement to provide engineering services to Gentherm, the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Under this agreement, we will expand our existing services to help develop a next-generation of products aimed at elevating customer vehicle experiences. Our expertise in firmware development and verification and validation from the Mobica acquisition played a critical role in differentiating our value proposition. We have also seen increased demand for infrastructure-led transformation to cloud, boosted in part by our Thirdera business, which we acquired in the first quarter. And our platform investments have helped drive increased Gen AI adoption. As of this quarter, we have over 200 clients on our AI-led platforms, including Neuro IT operations, Skygrade and Flowsource. Now, where are we with Gen AI? We see one of the biggest opportunities for Gen AI as tech-for-tech, which applies Gen AI to our software development cycles. With higher cost of capital in recent times, we believe that the need to do more with less combined with the leveraging of generative AI with lead companies into an era of hyper productivity. We believe this will fuel the next wave of digital transformation as clients seek to modernize the tech stack and reimagine business workflows with partners like Cognizant. In fact, in recently released follow-on analysis to our 2023 study with Oxford Economics, 70% of the respondents globally indicated they're not moving fast with Gen AI and 82% indicated a delay in execution could put them at a disadvantage. We are seeing a desire from our own clients to move more quickly. Over the past few quarters, we have become more deeply involved in our clients' Gen AI journeys. As of the end of second quarter, we have over 750 early client engagements, up from 450 in Q1, and we have over 600 opportunities in the pipeline compared to 500 last quarter. These early engagements have been across verticals with healthy activity in products and resources along with Financial Services and Health Sciences. We're seeing demand across four key areas: first, customer and employee experience; second, content summarization; third, content generation; and finally, tech-for-tech to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles. As an example of our recent work, Cognizant designed and recommended a business and technology architecture for AI development for a multinational accounting and audit services firm. This work included identifying the relevant technologies, infrastructure, skillsets, processes and data required to support AI development across the organization. And we are building a strong partnership eco-system to support our Gen AI strategy. This quarter, we are selected as an AWS Gen AI competency partner driven by our capabilities in addressing complex industry problems and our expertise in AWS specific Gen AI solutions. And we have signed a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to bring smart manufacturing solutions powered by Gen AI to market and transform manufacturing operations across various industries. As another example, we helped set up the world's largest pharmaceutical company's AWS infrastructure as a part of their Gen AI journey. We also automated the client's channeling of desperate data sources into a single vector data store to build a foundation for the Gen AI programs. In Health Sciences, we launched a first set of healthcare large language model solutions and Google Cloud's Gen AI technology, including Google's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models. The suite of solutions addressing four workflows, marketing operations, call center operations, provider management and contracting. Our aim is to improve healthcare administrative processes and experiences for our clients and their clients. We believe Gen AI has become a catalyst for clients who are behind in their data modernization or cloud journey and we are pursuing these projects to help them lay the foundation for enterprise-grade Gen AI implementations. In closing, I want to thank our employees around the world for their dedication to our clients in Cognizant. We have been executing well in a challenging macro-environment. In the back half of 2024, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities to drive revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry and to simplify our operations. With that, I'll hand it over to Jatin.\nJatin Dalal: Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Second quarter revenue and operating margin came in above our expectations. Despite customer behavior and discretionary spending trends remaining largely unchanged, strong execution and the ramp-up of large deals supported sequential revenue growth of 2.1% in constant currency. This provides us with revenue exit velocity going into Q3, and has allowed us to increase the midpoint of our organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Our cost optimization efforts, including structural actions under the NextGen program helped us deliver adjusted operating margins of 15.2%. This was a modest increase sequentially and 100 basis point increase from the prior-year period. We are pleased with the cost savings we have achieved under the program, which allowed us to expand adjusted operating margin while funding growth investments. Now, let's turn to the details. Second quarter revenue was approximately $4.9 billion, which, Ravi mentioned, exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. This represented a decline of 0.7% year-over-year or a decline of 0.5% in constant currency. In constant currency, growth was approximately 50 basis points better than the high end of our guidance range. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 60 basis points of growth from the recent acquisitions. Q2 bookings grew 5% year-over-year and were driven by mid-sized deals. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ticked up slightly to 1.4x from 1.3x in Q1. We continue to see a lengthening of contract durations, driven by a shift to larger longer-term contracts. This has extended the revenue conversion timing, but also provided improved forward visibility. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with the improved performance in Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially. Our Health Sciences business grew over 3% sequentially with solid growth across payer, provider and life sciences customers. Products & Resources revenue was down modestly quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 4% year-over-year in constant currency. The decline was due to ongoing discretionary spending pressure among our customers. We have seen demand in areas like grid modernization and cloud modernization investments among our utility customers. We have also seen pockets of strength in the travel and hospitality sector, led by improved travel demand as well as interest in Gen AI-powered personalization to deliver differentiated guest experiences. Our pipeline in Products & Resources remains healthy and we are excited to close the Belcan acquisition, which we expect will provide new growth opportunities in this segment. Communications, Media & Technology grew year-over-year, again supported by recently completed acquisitions. We have also continued to benefit from the ramp of new business within comms and media, which has helped offset lower level of discretionary spending among the technology customers. By geography, we were pleased with the growth in North America, driven in part by large deals ramping up over the last few quarters. However, other parts of the world, particularly Europe, remain challenged by soft discretionary spending. Despite this, we were also pleased with our return to sequential growth in our rest of the world region, where we are seeing early progress from recently won large deals and new logos and a healthy pipeline of new opportunities. Now, moving to margins. NextGen cost saving continued to progress and helped us offset the margin impact of recent large deal ramps. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $29 million in costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.17. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion. DSO of 80 days was up two days sequentially and increased five days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q2 was $183 million, primarily reflecting the seasonality. During the quarter, we returned $226 million to the shareholders, including $76 million through share repurchases and $150 million through our regular dividend. At the end of Q2, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. As of today, other than the expected closing of Belcan, we do not anticipate any material inorganic activity for the remainder of the year. As our immediate focus is on closing the Belcan acquisition and its initial integration work. We expect to return approximately $600 million to shareholders in form of share re-purchases and dividends in the second half of this year. This is expected to bring total capital return to the shareholders to approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. These amounts exclude the expected additional share repurchase activity to offset the new shares we plan to issue as part of Belcan acquisition. Turning to our forward outlook now. Our updated guidance does not include contribution from Belcan. We plan to update our outlook after the acquisition has closed, which we still expect to occur in the third quarter. There are no changes to the estimated financial impact that we provided at the time of the announcement. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Sequentially, this implies a growth of 0.7% to 2.2% in constant currency. For the full year, our organic revenue growth outlook has modestly improved. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion, which is a decline of 0.5% to growth of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Our updated guidance includes approximately 70 basis points of inorganic contribution versus our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points. This reflects the contribution from only our completed transactions. Therefore, at the midpoint, our organic growth outlook has improved by approximately 55 basis points. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our first half performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. Our guidance includes the expected impact of our merit cycle, which will take effect on August 1st. We expect this will be partially offset by the savings from our NextGen program and operational discipline. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $80 million, which compares to $60 million previously. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of net income. This includes the negative impact from $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in the first quarter in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.62 to $4.70, which reflects a $0.07 increase in the midpoint versus our prior range of $4.50 and $4.68. With that, we will open the call for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. First of all, on generative AI, helpful commentary, and Ravi, you mentioned the 750 early client engagements. Could you indicate whether any of your clients are moving beyond the proof of concept stage and what are those larger engagements -- what form are they taking? And can you maybe quantify the amount of bookings you currently have tied to generative AI at this stage?\nRavi Kumar: Yeah, thank you for that question. I think the one thing you want to know is generative AI is diffusing into all our technology-led projects in a very, very fast way. So, the ability to ring fence it and start to think about what it does to a technology, what it doesn't do a technology or how do you trace it back is always hard. So the best metric for us was to find out the number of projects we are doing around generative AI. So, the number we gave this quarter was 750, which is up from 450 last quarter. So, we're very, very pleased with the number of early engagements. We have 600 more in the pipeline. And if you remember quarter two of last year, we spoke about 100 active engagements. So, we've gone all the way from 100 to 750. Now, how much of this is going into real production work? I would say very small number of projects are going into production work. And that number is small because of multiple reasons. One is, as you get to production-grade work, you need to start to think about your data architecture, you need to start to think about your cloud infrastructure, and you also need to start to think about the cost of compute, the availability of talent and everything else. So, only a small minor portion of it is going into live production work. But what we are pleased is as we get past these inhibitors, if I may, we're going to see a sharpest curve. I actually believe this is going to be a sharpest curve. A lot of them are related to productivity and task automation. So, the benefits are very tangible, and hence, it will go through the sharpest curve. But progressively, we will start to see more projects related to innovation, more projects related to change in operating model. And in fact, one of the surveys we did just a few weeks ago with 2,200 business executives from 15 countries has also started to tell us that productivity doesn't mean just cost reduction. Productivity also means new revenue streams and new products and new services. So, we are, again, excited about the fact that if it is revenue generating, the acceleration to the smart -- the sharp S curve is going to be much quicker. So that's one metric to know how well we're doing. The second metric I would say, which I spoke about, is we have 200-plus clients on all our platforms, AI platforms. The AI platforms we have at Cognizant are all related to how do you take foundation models and make them production grade, be it accuracy of the models, be it governance, be it management, be it responsible AI. So, these 200 clients are experimenting with us to make sure that they're getting ready for production, because they're a part of our platform. So, that gives me indication that there is a good momentum in the future. We also dissect this into four different categories. A lot of it is content aggregation and customer experience and employee experience. Again, the benefits in the business case are very tangible here. So, we will see faster acceleration. Then, of course, the biggest use case is tech for tech, which is applying it to development cycles. The challenges in that particular case, you have to share the productivity benefits with your clients. So, the good news is, it increases our win rates. And if we are ahead of the curve, we get to save some of that. And the last one, I would say, is content generation, which is more creative. It will take a little longer time. So overall, we're very pleased with where we are. We're very pleased with the fact that some of this is leading to more structural work related to data and cloud, which by itself is a heavy lift for us, which will then get monetized into services dollars. So that's broadly where generative AI story is. And I think the excitement about how much productivity we can generate for our clients and create a flywheel on this makes it the biggest opportunity for us to tap into the future.\nJim Schneider: Thanks for that. And second one, if I may, on gross margins, in the quarter, revenue was up sequentially, headcount was down, I believe, and utilization was up. So, what were some of the factors that are pressuring the gross margins such as project pricing and higher start-up costs on large deals? And can you maybe comment on the prospects or expanding those gross margins over the next couple of quarters?\nJatin Dalal: Sure. So, quarter two was a good execution quarter where we improved our utilization. We continue to deliver sequential growth while actually reducing the trajectory of employees in terms of the headcount. So, overall, good execution. Why you are not seeing it yet reflected in the gross margin is really what you mentioned, the growth or the ramp up of the large deals that we have won in past, and they are ramping up and there is an initial investment of slightly lower margin as those deals ramp up. And that's the reason that gross margin number has remained flattish between quarter one and quarter two. We are optimistic that as we move into quarter three, quarter four, you should start seeing a slightly better performance on gross margin as we get through quarter four.\nRavi Kumar: Just to link back to your AI question on this, if you look at the math, we sequentially dropped by 8,000-odd people and year-on-year we dropped by 9,000 people, but we sequentially grew by 2%. And what that really means is a part of it is running with tight utilization. A part of it is related to AI, doing work with lesser number of people, and therefore, creating a productivity benefit for us. So, just to add to the AI -- the reason why some of that is explainable is also because AI and automation is starting to be applied to our projects.\nJim Schneider: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Bergin: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. I wanted to ask on bookings, so nice to see a return to growth here. It does seem like you've had a recent uptick in deal activity just based on your announcements. Can you comment on the level of bookings that you would say are kind of net new work versus renewals? And just any common threads to highlight across the latest deals that were announced?\nRavi Kumar: So, let me take a shot at it and I'll ask Jatin to add. We don't give the renewal and -- split of renewal and new business, but I can tell you one thing that our new business is significantly higher than the renewals in 2024 versus 2023. So, we're very, very happy about it. The second is there is also new logos and expansion in the bookings. So, we are again very pleased. One of the reasons why Financial Services grew well -- I mean Financial Services grew sequentially after 2022 and it grew well, because we also opened new logos. We started to look for expansion in existing customers. So that's all contributing to our bookings. We had five large deals with more than $100 million and we had two of them with the range of $90 million-plus. In fact, all five of them actually had expansion in new business in the mix. So, we are again very pleased about how the amount of work we're getting, which is new and expansion, is increasing. Of course, the duration of deals is also increasing. On the higher end, I mean the larger deals above $50 million, the duration is increasing. While it creates stickiness, but it also creates a little bit of a tail on -- when the revenue is going to be realized as we go forward.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. I appreciate that detail. And then my follow-up on Belcan. So, I understand you're still waiting to close the deal. I believe you mentioned it was estimated to be about 40 bps of a margin headwind and then some revenue synergies over three years. Can you detail kind of the transitory costs, the deal costs in that 40 bps versus the structural margin of Belcan? And then just any further detail on kind of how you thought about the phasing of the $100 million-plus revenue synergies over three years?\nJatin Dalal: Yeah. So, we -- I mean the numbers that you mentioned are accurate, 40 basis point of margin dilution and the synergy numbers. We will share a more detailed update on Belcan on closing including making sure that our guidance then reflects the Belcan acquisition for the rest of the year. There is no new or -- new data point or update to the numbers that we had shared before at this juncture.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate the insight here. I understand some of the efficiency gains you're seeing, but how much room do you have in utilization before it perhaps runs too hot? And how are you thinking about pace of hiring for the remainder of the year, particularly as you look to support from the deal wins and pipeline? Additionally, any callouts here around competition for talent given the higher attrition you saw?\nJatin Dalal: So, this is Jatin, and I'll go first, and I'll request Ravi to add. I think so far, we are seeing stability in the talent marketplace. It is reflected in our attrition. We are seeing sufficient availability of the talent that we need to hire for the specific skill set that we need to hire from the marketplace. There will always be couple of skill sets which are more hot or difficult to find than others, but on an aggregate basis, I think we still have a reasonably good market for talent as we look at the second half of the year.\nRavi Kumar: Was there a first part of the question as well, Jonathan?\nJonathan Lee: Yeah, it was more about the room you have in utilization before it perhaps runs too hot.\nJatin Dalal: I think we still have some headspace for sure as we exit quarter two. Certainly, not as -- I mean, the headspace we have continued to sort of utilize and this is the third quarter of improvement utilization. So, we are continuing to improve it. We have some space. I wouldn't say it's a significant space. And we are managing the supply chain with that visibility of headspace and the demand which is coming into the door. And we are confident that we'll be able to manage the demand and supply chain equation well as we execute through the second half of the year.\nRavi Kumar: Yeah. So, just to add some more color, Jonathan, on this, we are now at a spot where we have significant attractiveness in the market for employees to join us. I mean, our momentum in the market also allows us, gives us the ability to hire. We also have returners. In fact, we have a historic return of returners as I call it. I mean, it is people coming back who worked at Cognizant before. And our fulfillment engine is a combination of four things: freshers, rotating talent inside the company, reskilling from the adjacencies, and hiring lateral talent. All four, I think, we are getting better and better and better since the last 18 months. So, we are gearing up for a high-demand situation whenever, but we want to be prepared for it. Our two big industries, financial services and healthcare, together is 60% of our business. They're both in great and in a good spot. So that gives us confidence. I mean these were two verticals where Cognizant's legacy and heritage was so strong. So, we are back on those two verticals with a good positive momentum.\nJonathan Lee: Thanks for the [detail] (ph) there. How should we think about potential for stabilization around large deal project margin, especially given some of the elongation of the duration in these large deals? And how are you thinking about pyramid structure around staffing these large deals?\nRavi Kumar: Yeah. So, large deals -- and Jatin chip-in as I complete. Large deals always have upfront cost and downstream revenue kind of a thing, because you do transition and a lot of these are vendor consolidation, cost optimization kind of deal. So, you will have to invest on transition and everything else. So, there is lumpiness on how that works, but we have now muscle to execute them pretty well. We have done this for 18 months now. We've been on a cycle of winning and delivering the large deals. So we're very confident of continuing on that process. We are not only doing this on application services now, which was the heritage and the historic muscle of Cognizant. We are doing it in BPO and infrastructure services, and now we're starting to see good traction in ER&D and as Belcan comes in subsequently, we will -- hopefully as it gets close, we will hopefully have more of it as well. So, it's a much more comprehensive breadth of capability and the breadth of large deals which we are executing on. We are competing in the market and the levers to compete are not just arbitrage on labor, the levers to compete are also productivity levers powered by automation and AI. And I think we are ahead of the curve. That's one of the reasons why we are winning more. It is a wallet share, which we are picking up from our peers. Jatin, do you want to add anything?\nJatin Dalal: Yeah. I think the only additional color is there are two ways of looking at a large deal sort of dynamics or financials. One way is that they initially do come with lower margins, but if you see the construct of a large deal, they are typically fixed price projects over a long-term period, which means your ability to improve overall pyramid into the company, deploy Gen Zs as we call them internally or fresh talent at the bottom of the pyramid is much better, ability to execute on your automation goal is far superior in a larger program. So overall, the second way of looking at a large deal is that you can really push the envelope of efficiency and productivity much better than what you would be able to do in a time and material construct. So, it has also a positive angle to it as the deal matures.\nJonathan Lee: Always appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRod Bourgeois: Okay, great. Hey, Ravi, a couple of big picture questions. Over the last year and a half, you've been in a turnaround situation, while also wrestling with a cyclical downturn in demand. You've definitely made progress on shoring up talent and the culture and you're now winning these large deals. I just wanted to see if you can now speak to like your main goals for the next phase of Cognizant's improvement process?\nRavi Kumar: Rod, thank you for that question. I've always been a believer of layering performance and change. So, for the first 18 months, I've been constantly making changes and generating performance and using the performance to make more change. At the end of first year, we bought a company called Thirdera, and that was the time I started to believe that performance has changed as you layer it. You also start to get the license to do some big bets. So, we made that big bet of buying Thirdera, which is the single largest ServiceNow standalone company. And right now, they're probably one of the top two players of ServiceNow in the market. And I'm very confident that journey will continue. In the first half of this year, we started to think that -- our business has four vectors, as I said, tech services, BPO, infrastructure-led services, which is security, cloud, everything put together, and ER&D. We always wanted to take another big bet and look for a different bio group and look for a different industry muscle, if I may, and we took a bet on Belcan, which gives us the opportunity to be in aerospace and automotive embedded software and engineering research and development, which is a different buyer group in any of our clients. And we took a bet because we think that's going to increase the breadth of services and it's going to give us a new vector for growth. So, I think I'm going to layer the performance and change on a constant basis and keep looking for big bets so that we make this a resilient platform. Remember, healthcare and financial services, we are heavy on it. Now, we're going to create muscle on manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aerospace, which is going to be a very different industry vector. We are -- we will constantly keep looking for bridging those gaps in new industries and a breadth of capabilities and also expanding internationally as we go forward because we are over indexed on the U.S. So that will be my goal to create sustained momentum and create a resilient platform for our employees and our clients.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for sharing that. And maybe I'll change my follow-up given your answer related to Belcan. One of the questions that we're seeing right now Capgemini recently cited weakened demand in aerospace and automotive. Those are verticals that had been very strong over the last year at most players. Are you seeing similar trends in aerospace and automotive weakening, or is that not really a concern, especially as you onboard the Belcan business?\nRavi Kumar: Rod, that's a great question. Organically, we are seeing strength in automotive. Our pivot on Belcan is very simple. We think the next decade is going to be about digitizing everything physical, so we believe the industries like manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aero. If you pivot into services, which are embedded software, pivot into services, which are digital in nature, there's significant headroom, and there is very little spent in the last 10 years, and therefore, I think the next 10 years are going to be much better. So therefore, I actually believe there are -- there is more space and more room for us. Our concentration is very high in healthcare and financial services. So, this actually gives us much -- a very different industry vertical, but it also gives us an opportunity to bring technology closer to the physical manifestation of these industries. So, that thesis of mind still holds. And I think with AI in the mix now, I actually believe the offerings we will now present to that industry segment are going to be as contemporary, and therefore, will continue to flourish. So that's my thesis when I looked at Belcan and that would be the thesis that it will remain with me even now.\nRod Bourgeois: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate all the color. Encouraging to see the turn in in the financial services end market, et cetera. And it seems like [indiscernible] things from others. Kind of wondering what your visibility is on that part of your end market base. And what the nature of the work is that you're doing now say versus before it kind of turned down and if that's changed at all?\nRavi Kumar: Financial Services, we've been working on it since 2023. 2023, we stabilized the teams, we ensured that the leaks we had -- we were on the other side. I mean when consolidation happened, we lost business in 2022. We now are gaining market share when there is consolidation. And we did a very good job of leading that vertical with industry solutions. So that helped us to pivot into some of the small discretionary spend, which is coming back to -- we rallied behind it. So, the industry solution approach, a stable team, walking the corridors, proactively pitching for value-led work, breadth of capability now, I mean, we are no longer a tech services firm, we have a breadth of capability, all of that has helped us to stabilize financial services. Of course, there's going to be variability quarter-on-quarter, but we feel confident about the fact that each one of those subsegments underneath that are in good shape. Our business in Americas and banking has sequentially done pretty well for two quarters in a row. So, now we are starting to progressively take that -- take the same template to -- in the international market, so that we could replicate that success.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Appreciate that. And then, back on Gen AI, I'm just wondering if you're seeing those projects crowd out other consulting priorities. And if so, which ones? Or are we still -- as you suggested, still so early before moving to full production implementation of AI -- Gen AI projects that it's not really having much of an impact?\nRavi Kumar: That's a very good question. In fact, I agree with you that a lot of the consulting dollars are getting diverted to generative AI. I mean, all the way from business case creation to governance to -- some companies are reorganizing their -- I know companies which are now saying, we need to reestablish an enterprise 2.0, so that process and technology can be together and it could be a distributed networked organization versus a hierarchical setup. So, lots of organizational change and experimentation is actually led by generative AI. So, some of the discretionary is getting diverted there. But these are small prototypes, and as you finish the prototypes, you start to see the bottlenecks to take it to production. The good news is at least you start to know what the bottlenecks are and then you start to work on it and then you take them to production grade. I have at least some projects which have started to go production grade. I've mentioned it in my earnings, which is a pharmaceutical company taking generative AI for drug development and insurers using generative AI to support claims which come in, which need to be corrected because there are either fields which have not been filled up or there are clarifications. So, I think at a task level, we are starting to see this go forward. The productivity studies we did in 2023 that helped us also to put the business case up. So, we've seen in healthcare in one of my clients, we've done auto adjudication of claims better using generative AI. So, the ability to make this a very outcome-centric business case will allow us to take this to more production-grade work, and the ability to continue to look for new use cases will help us to build the pipeline as the old ones mature.\nJames Faucette: Great. Appreciate all that color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. Just want to follow-up on your answer to Bryan's, I think, question on bookings. Ravi, you mentioned duration. I always ask you, but I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on just the ACV versus TCV dynamic. Has that changed, improved, worsened? And then also on incremental bookings, where is the work coming from? Is it new work or take away from other vendors? Has that changed at all in terms of sourcing deals? Thanks.\nJatin Dalal: Yeah, sure. So, I think fundamentally not much change in ACV as you can imagine with the deal duration going up from -- I mean over longer term, it has to reflect in a slightly slower growth in ACV and that dynamics continue. However, we are clearly winning market share in as we execute every quarter. So, the deals that are ramping up or the deal announcement that we have done are really reflection of new work that Cognizant is getting, sometimes in new accounts, but also in many accounts where we were present, but we were not addressing that segment of the work with our customer.\nRavi Kumar: There's also focus on new logos. So, it's a combination of new logos expansion and new work. And I can certainly tell you that the new work is outpacing the renewals at least in 2024.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Right. Heard that. Loud and clear. Thank you for that. Just my quick follow-up on the fourth quarter implied from the guide for the full year that implies some sequential deceleration. Any call outs there beyond seasonality?\nJatin Dalal: Yeah. So, you're right, it does at the midpoint of quarter three performance, it would imply a deceleration in quarter four, but that is really seasonality right now as we see it.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Terrific. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys, very strong results. Nice to see that. Can you maybe -- I mean, the number one question we get from investors right now is like have we seen the bottom in IT services spend? I mean, this is pretty much what everyone is trying to figure out. Can you maybe make a more general comment from your seat on where we are in the cycle? Thank you.\nJatin Dalal: So, it's a broad question. Let me address it from the context of Cognizant, clearly, for us, we see a growth as a guidance range that we have given for quarter three after a decline sort of a performance for [indiscernible]. So certainly, we are seeing an uptick and an improvement from where we were. So certainly, there is an uptick in the numbers in a positive growth trajectory as we progress through the year. It's difficult to make a comment on a larger market as we covered in our prepared remarks, market still remains uncertain, but clearly, there are pockets where there are opportunities and we are capitalizing on those opportunities as has been reflected in our BFSI performance, as has been reflected in our health performance, both of which our largest sector, we have delivered very strong sequential numbers.\nRavi Kumar: Just to add to that, I said this before, we are -- we don't see deterioration or improvement. We see the market unchanged, as I call it. However, our execution, our fulfillment rates and our win ratios continue to be very strong. So therefore, we are winning wallet share in a market which has remained unchanged.\nDan Dolev: Understood. And then maybe a follow-up on Gen AI. I know everyone's talking about this, but would you feel comfortable, I guess, at some point providing dollar value of the scope of the AI projects?\nRavi Kumar: We have to keep thinking about what are the right ways to tell the market about generative AI. It's a pervasive technology and therefore it diffuses into everything we do. And because it is diffusing so fast, you almost want to say -- you almost don't know what to categorize as Gen AI and what not to categorize as Gen AI. The only thing I can say is in this market, you could win using generative AI, you could increase your win rates, you could create new deals, you could generate more momentum with your clients, equally you could flip it around and use it on your own self to disrupt your own development cycles of our teams and create productivity, which you can share with your clients and then create a flywheel of winnability through it. So, I mean, right now, we are talking about projects which we are doing, we are talking about platforms and how many clients have onboarded on platforms. The traceability to revenues is, I mean, anybody's guess what you call generative AI as generative AI and what you can't. I mean, today, data modernization project or a cloud modernization project, which we do because generative AI is going to be the future, I actually can call it as generative AI or I can say this is not generative AI. However, it is creating more momentum because that foundation is needed for generative AI. So I mean, we have to evolve this to an extent where we could communicate to all of you much -- in a much traceable way. But nobody has found -- I mean, nobody seems to have found the right way to do it. We are trying our best to tell you the traction we have.\nDan Dolev: Fair enough. Great results again. Thank you.\nJatin Dalal: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nRavi Kumar: Thank you so much. Thank you for joining in today and looking forward to the next quarter and thank you for all your support.\nOperator: This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions' second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us. Second quarter revenue and operating margin came in above our expectations. Despite customer behavior and discretionary spending trends remaining largely unchanged, strong execution and the ramp-up of large deals supported sequential revenue growth of 2.1% in constant currency. This provides us with revenue exit velocity going into Q3, and has allowed us to increase the midpoint of our organic revenue growth guidance for the full year. Our cost optimization efforts, including structural actions under the NextGen program helped us deliver adjusted operating margins of 15.2%. This was a modest increase sequentially and 100 basis point increase from the prior-year period. We are pleased with the cost savings we have achieved under the program, which allowed us to expand adjusted operating margin while funding growth investments. Now, let's turn to the details. Second quarter revenue was approximately $4.9 billion, which, Ravi mentioned, exceeded the higher end of our guidance range. This represented a decline of 0.7% year-over-year or a decline of 0.5% in constant currency. In constant currency, growth was approximately 50 basis points better than the high end of our guidance range. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 60 basis points of growth from the recent acquisitions. Q2 bookings grew 5% year-over-year and were driven by mid-sized deals. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ticked up slightly to 1.4x from 1.3x in Q1. We continue to see a lengthening of contract durations, driven by a shift to larger longer-term contracts. This has extended the revenue conversion timing, but also provided improved forward visibility. As Ravi mentioned, we were pleased with the improved performance in Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially. Our Health Sciences business grew over 3% sequentially with solid growth across payer, provider and life sciences customers. Products & Resources revenue was down modestly quarter-over-quarter and down approximately 4% year-over-year in constant currency. The decline was due to ongoing discretionary spending pressure among our customers. We have seen demand in areas like grid modernization and cloud modernization investments among our utility customers. We have also seen pockets of strength in the travel and hospitality sector, led by improved travel demand as well as interest in Gen AI-powered personalization to deliver differentiated guest experiences. Our pipeline in Products & Resources remains healthy and we are excited to close the Belcan acquisition, which we expect will provide new growth opportunities in this segment. Communications, Media & Technology grew year-over-year, again supported by recently completed acquisitions. We have also continued to benefit from the ramp of new business within comms and media, which has helped offset lower level of discretionary spending among the technology customers. By geography, we were pleased with the growth in North America, driven in part by large deals ramping up over the last few quarters. However, other parts of the world, particularly Europe, remain challenged by soft discretionary spending. Despite this, we were also pleased with our return to sequential growth in our rest of the world region, where we are seeing early progress from recently won large deals and new logos and a healthy pipeline of new opportunities. Now, moving to margins. NextGen cost saving continued to progress and helped us offset the margin impact of recent large deal ramps. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $29 million in costs related to NextGen, which negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 60 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, the prior-year period included a 60 basis points benefit from an insurance recovery. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%, reflecting a benefit from the timing of discrete items. Q2 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.14 and Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.17. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion. DSO of 80 days was up two days sequentially and increased five days year-over-year, driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q2 was $183 million, primarily reflecting the seasonality. During the quarter, we returned $226 million to the shareholders, including $76 million through share repurchases and $150 million through our regular dividend. At the end of Q2, we had $1.6 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. As of today, other than the expected closing of Belcan, we do not anticipate any material inorganic activity for the remainder of the year. As our immediate focus is on closing the Belcan acquisition and its initial integration work. We expect to return approximately $600 million to shareholders in form of share re-purchases and dividends in the second half of this year. This is expected to bring total capital return to the shareholders to approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. These amounts exclude the expected additional share repurchase activity to offset the new shares we plan to issue as part of Belcan acquisition. Turning to our forward outlook now. Our updated guidance does not include contribution from Belcan. We plan to update our outlook after the acquisition has closed, which we still expect to occur in the third quarter. There are no changes to the estimated financial impact that we provided at the time of the announcement. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Sequentially, this implies a growth of 0.7% to 2.2% in constant currency. For the full year, our organic revenue growth outlook has modestly improved. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $19.3 billion to $19.5 billion, which is a decline of 0.5% to growth of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Our updated guidance includes approximately 70 basis points of inorganic contribution versus our prior guidance of up to 100 basis points. This reflects the contribution from only our completed transactions. Therefore, at the midpoint, our organic growth outlook has improved by approximately 55 basis points. Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our first half performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. Our guidance includes the expected impact of our merit cycle, which will take effect on August 1st. We expect this will be partially offset by the savings from our NextGen program and operational discipline. For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $80 million, which compares to $60 million previously. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of net income. This includes the negative impact from $360 million payment made to Indian tax authorities in the first quarter in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter. Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.62 to $4.70, which reflects a $0.07 increase in the midpoint versus our prior range of $4.50 and $4.68. With that, we will open the call for your questions. Sure. So, quarter two was a good execution quarter where we improved our utilization. We continue to deliver sequential growth while actually reducing the trajectory of employees in terms of the headcount. So, overall, good execution. Why you are not seeing it yet reflected in the gross margin is really what you mentioned, the growth or the ramp up of the large deals that we have won in past, and they are ramping up and there is an initial investment of slightly lower margin as those deals ramp up. And that's the reason that gross margin number has remained flattish between quarter one and quarter two. We are optimistic that as we move into quarter three, quarter four, you should start seeing a slightly better performance on gross margin as we get through quarter four. Yeah. So, we -- I mean the numbers that you mentioned are accurate, 40 basis point of margin dilution and the synergy numbers. We will share a more detailed update on Belcan on closing including making sure that our guidance then reflects the Belcan acquisition for the rest of the year. There is no new or -- new data point or update to the numbers that we had shared before at this juncture. So, this is Jatin, and I'll go first, and I'll request Ravi to add. I think so far, we are seeing stability in the talent marketplace. It is reflected in our attrition. We are seeing sufficient availability of the talent that we need to hire for the specific skill set that we need to hire from the marketplace. There will always be couple of skill sets which are more hot or difficult to find than others, but on an aggregate basis, I think we still have a reasonably good market for talent as we look at the second half of the year. I think we still have some headspace for sure as we exit quarter two. Certainly, not as -- I mean, the headspace we have continued to sort of utilize and this is the third quarter of improvement utilization. So, we are continuing to improve it. We have some space. I wouldn't say it's a significant space. And we are managing the supply chain with that visibility of headspace and the demand which is coming into the door. And we are confident that we'll be able to manage the demand and supply chain equation well as we execute through the second half of the year. Yeah. I think the only additional color is there are two ways of looking at a large deal sort of dynamics or financials. One way is that they initially do come with lower margins, but if you see the construct of a large deal, they are typically fixed price projects over a long-term period, which means your ability to improve overall pyramid into the company, deploy Gen Zs as we call them internally or fresh talent at the bottom of the pyramid is much better, ability to execute on your automation goal is far superior in a larger program. So overall, the second way of looking at a large deal is that you can really push the envelope of efficiency and productivity much better than what you would be able to do in a time and material construct. So, it has also a positive angle to it as the deal matures. Yeah, sure. So, I think fundamentally not much change in ACV as you can imagine with the deal duration going up from -- I mean over longer term, it has to reflect in a slightly slower growth in ACV and that dynamics continue. However, we are clearly winning market share in as we execute every quarter. So, the deals that are ramping up or the deal announcement that we have done are really reflection of new work that Cognizant is getting, sometimes in new accounts, but also in many accounts where we were present, but we were not addressing that segment of the work with our customer. Yeah. So, you're right, it does at the midpoint of quarter three performance, it would imply a deceleration in quarter four, but that is really seasonality right now as we see it. So, it's a broad question. Let me address it from the context of Cognizant, clearly, for us, we see a growth as a guidance range that we have given for quarter three after a decline sort of a performance for [indiscernible]. So certainly, we are seeing an uptick and an improvement from where we were. So certainly, there is an uptick in the numbers in a positive growth trajectory as we progress through the year. It's difficult to make a comment on a larger market as we covered in our prepared remarks, market still remains uncertain, but clearly, there are pockets where there are opportunities and we are capitalizing on those opportunities as has been reflected in our BFSI performance, as has been reflected in our health performance, both of which our largest sector, we have delivered very strong sequential numbers. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Ravi Kumar",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased with our strong execution and results in what remains a challenging market. We delivered revenue above the high end of our guidance range, expanded our adjusted operating margin both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, sustained our large deal momentum by signing five deals each with total contract value of $100 million or more, and announced an agreement to acquire Belcan, which is expected to expand our ER&D capabilities, while diversifying into the high-growth aerospace and defense sectors. Although the demand environment remains challenging and clients' discretionary spending behavior is unchanged from recent quarters, we believe these results demonstrate our rigorous execution against the strategic priorities we set forth last year. Q2 revenue was $4.85 billion, which was $30 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 2.1% sequentially in constant currency. This was the highest quarter-over-quarter growth since 2022. With strong execution of our NextGen program and overall cost discipline, we achieved adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, an increase of 10 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year. Our trailing 12-months voluntary attrition for tech services was 13.6% compared to nearly 20% in the prior-year period. Second quarter bookings grew 5% year-over-year and, on a trailing 12-months basis, bookings were $26.2 billion, representing a 1.4x book-to-bill. In addition to the five deals each with TCV of over $100 million, we signed two deals that were above $90 million each. In the first half of this year, we have now signed 13 deals each with TCV of over $100 million, well ahead of our 2023 pace, which included 17 deals of this size for the entire year. From a segment perspective, we are especially pleased with Financial Services, which grew 5% sequentially in constant currency, driven by growth in the Americas. Within Financial Services, our banking business posted a second consecutive quarter of sequential growth and returned to modest year-over-year growth in constant currency for the first time since Q2 of 2022. We are seeing demand being driven by client investments and hyper personalization, infrastructure and platform modernization. Our insurance sub-segment also grew sequentially in Q2, and one of the $500 million-plus TCV deals we signed this quarter was with a large American insurance provider. I believe these results reflect our actions to stabilize the BFSI business since last year. Over that period, we put new leadership in place and drove greater industry focus on this customer segments. We also aligned our go-to-market approach and launched industry-led service offerings in areas like real-time payment fraud detection, payments hub modernization and digital banking. Health Sciences grew by 3% sequentially in constant currency and we see a number of positive secular trends. For example, payers and providers remain focused on reducing the cost of care. We believe this is benefiting our TriZetto platform, where we are helping clients manage more than [$500 billion] (ph) in complex claims and improve patient outcomes. TriZetto's end-to-end capabilities are gaining traction as clients see the value of -- in our ability to provide both revenue cycle management and clearinghouse services. On the payer side, we're seeing demand being driven by data and cloud modernization as our clients seek to deliver a modern best-in-class consumer experience for the members. And in life sciences, clients have begun moving beyond cost optimization projects to once that accelerate their GenAI and digital transformation in R&D and continue to drive enterprise modernization with SAP S/4HANA. By region, we are very pleased with the performance in Americas, where revenue grew 2.8% sequentially and returned to growth year-over-year. I am extremely proud of the progress the team has made and I'm confident in our opportunities ahead. Looking back over the last 18 months, we believe our strategic investments and focus on improving our operational rigor has further strengthened a foundation on which we can drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. We invested in our leadership team and attracted new talent to the organization. We drove internal process improvements, particularly around large deals and our talent. And we focus sharply on strengthening our relevance with clients through investments in our innovation strategy and platform offerings. We believe these changes are starting to pay off and are reflected in our recent revenue performance and year-over-year operating margin expansion in the first half of this year. We have maintained our focus on becoming an employer of choice in our industry and we're recognized by the Newsweek as one of America's Greatest Places to Work and Greatest Places for Job Starters. We also continue to expand our footprint in smaller cities in India with the opening of a newest office in Indore, as we remain committed to bringing offices closest to where our employees are. And I'm pleased with Bluebolt, our grassroots innovation program, which has generated 210,000 ideas by our associates since its inception last year. We're also hearing positive feedback from our customers through our project-level net promoter score, which I'm pleased to say has improved consistently since 2021 through the first half of 2024. This quarter marks our highest NPS to-date. We have taken a number of actions to-date to accelerate growth and drive operational improvements, and we look forward to continuing to update shareholders on our progress. To that end, we plan to provide an investor update in the first half of 2025 to discuss, among other things, our strategy, our differentiation in the market, our efforts to create long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. A prime example of our investments in higher-growth industries and expanding capabilities is our agreements to acquire Belcan, a leading global supplier of engineering, research and development, or ER&D, services. We have seen growing demand in ER&D services, an estimated $190 billion market whose high growth has been fueled by the convergence of digital technology and the physical world. Over the last three years, we have strengthened our ER&D capabilities, starting with our 2021 acquisition of ESG Mobility, a digital automotive ER&D provider for connected autonomous and electric vehicles. And at the start of my term last year, we acquired Mobica, which focuses on IoT-embedded software engineering capabilities from the chip to the cloud. We expect the Belcan acquisition to provide an opportunity for us to expand our service offerings into growth vectors that help move the physical world of manufacturing aerospace and automotive into the age of digital data and AI. Earlier this week, we introduced the next evolution of our experienced practice area called Cognizant Moment, which is a new integrated business within Cognizant that builds on our over 20 years of expertise and digital experience. Cognizant Moment will focus on next-generation experience services that are dynamic, data-led and AI-powered, harnessing the content generation and personalization power that generative AI brings, combined with human ingenuity, to help clients innovate, differentiate and grow. The creative and programmatic services lifecycle is expected to go through significant transformation in the years ahead, and we see an opportunity to disrupt the status quo agency model as creative content becomes increasingly generated and orchestrated by Gen AI-led models. Moving on to additional highlights from the quarter. We extended our relationship with Victory Capital to provide IT infrastructure and data analytics support. Over the next five years, we aim to provide this client with new service management capabilities, improved service productivity, opportunities for cost savings and the ability for Victory Capital to cost effectively scale in support of business growth. Additionally, we signed an agreement to provide engineering services to Gentherm, the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Under this agreement, we will expand our existing services to help develop a next-generation of products aimed at elevating customer vehicle experiences. Our expertise in firmware development and verification and validation from the Mobica acquisition played a critical role in differentiating our value proposition. We have also seen increased demand for infrastructure-led transformation to cloud, boosted in part by our Thirdera business, which we acquired in the first quarter. And our platform investments have helped drive increased Gen AI adoption. As of this quarter, we have over 200 clients on our AI-led platforms, including Neuro IT operations, Skygrade and Flowsource. Now, where are we with Gen AI? We see one of the biggest opportunities for Gen AI as tech-for-tech, which applies Gen AI to our software development cycles. With higher cost of capital in recent times, we believe that the need to do more with less combined with the leveraging of generative AI with lead companies into an era of hyper productivity. We believe this will fuel the next wave of digital transformation as clients seek to modernize the tech stack and reimagine business workflows with partners like Cognizant. In fact, in recently released follow-on analysis to our 2023 study with Oxford Economics, 70% of the respondents globally indicated they're not moving fast with Gen AI and 82% indicated a delay in execution could put them at a disadvantage. We are seeing a desire from our own clients to move more quickly. Over the past few quarters, we have become more deeply involved in our clients' Gen AI journeys. As of the end of second quarter, we have over 750 early client engagements, up from 450 in Q1, and we have over 600 opportunities in the pipeline compared to 500 last quarter. These early engagements have been across verticals with healthy activity in products and resources along with Financial Services and Health Sciences. We're seeing demand across four key areas: first, customer and employee experience; second, content summarization; third, content generation; and finally, tech-for-tech to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles. As an example of our recent work, Cognizant designed and recommended a business and technology architecture for AI development for a multinational accounting and audit services firm. This work included identifying the relevant technologies, infrastructure, skillsets, processes and data required to support AI development across the organization. And we are building a strong partnership eco-system to support our Gen AI strategy. This quarter, we are selected as an AWS Gen AI competency partner driven by our capabilities in addressing complex industry problems and our expertise in AWS specific Gen AI solutions. And we have signed a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to bring smart manufacturing solutions powered by Gen AI to market and transform manufacturing operations across various industries. As another example, we helped set up the world's largest pharmaceutical company's AWS infrastructure as a part of their Gen AI journey. We also automated the client's channeling of desperate data sources into a single vector data store to build a foundation for the Gen AI programs. In Health Sciences, we launched a first set of healthcare large language model solutions and Google Cloud's Gen AI technology, including Google's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models. The suite of solutions addressing four workflows, marketing operations, call center operations, provider management and contracting. Our aim is to improve healthcare administrative processes and experiences for our clients and their clients. We believe Gen AI has become a catalyst for clients who are behind in their data modernization or cloud journey and we are pursuing these projects to help them lay the foundation for enterprise-grade Gen AI implementations. In closing, I want to thank our employees around the world for their dedication to our clients in Cognizant. We have been executing well in a challenging macro-environment. In the back half of 2024, we'll remain focused on our strategic priorities to drive revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry and to simplify our operations. With that, I'll hand it over to Jatin. Yeah, thank you for that question. I think the one thing you want to know is generative AI is diffusing into all our technology-led projects in a very, very fast way. So, the ability to ring fence it and start to think about what it does to a technology, what it doesn't do a technology or how do you trace it back is always hard. So the best metric for us was to find out the number of projects we are doing around generative AI. So, the number we gave this quarter was 750, which is up from 450 last quarter. So, we're very, very pleased with the number of early engagements. We have 600 more in the pipeline. And if you remember quarter two of last year, we spoke about 100 active engagements. So, we've gone all the way from 100 to 750. Now, how much of this is going into real production work? I would say very small number of projects are going into production work. And that number is small because of multiple reasons. One is, as you get to production-grade work, you need to start to think about your data architecture, you need to start to think about your cloud infrastructure, and you also need to start to think about the cost of compute, the availability of talent and everything else. So, only a small minor portion of it is going into live production work. But what we are pleased is as we get past these inhibitors, if I may, we're going to see a sharpest curve. I actually believe this is going to be a sharpest curve. A lot of them are related to productivity and task automation. So, the benefits are very tangible, and hence, it will go through the sharpest curve. But progressively, we will start to see more projects related to innovation, more projects related to change in operating model. And in fact, one of the surveys we did just a few weeks ago with 2,200 business executives from 15 countries has also started to tell us that productivity doesn't mean just cost reduction. Productivity also means new revenue streams and new products and new services. So, we are, again, excited about the fact that if it is revenue generating, the acceleration to the smart -- the sharp S curve is going to be much quicker. So that's one metric to know how well we're doing. The second metric I would say, which I spoke about, is we have 200-plus clients on all our platforms, AI platforms. The AI platforms we have at Cognizant are all related to how do you take foundation models and make them production grade, be it accuracy of the models, be it governance, be it management, be it responsible AI. So, these 200 clients are experimenting with us to make sure that they're getting ready for production, because they're a part of our platform. So, that gives me indication that there is a good momentum in the future. We also dissect this into four different categories. A lot of it is content aggregation and customer experience and employee experience. Again, the benefits in the business case are very tangible here. So, we will see faster acceleration. Then, of course, the biggest use case is tech for tech, which is applying it to development cycles. The challenges in that particular case, you have to share the productivity benefits with your clients. So, the good news is, it increases our win rates. And if we are ahead of the curve, we get to save some of that. And the last one, I would say, is content generation, which is more creative. It will take a little longer time. So overall, we're very pleased with where we are. We're very pleased with the fact that some of this is leading to more structural work related to data and cloud, which by itself is a heavy lift for us, which will then get monetized into services dollars. So that's broadly where generative AI story is. And I think the excitement about how much productivity we can generate for our clients and create a flywheel on this makes it the biggest opportunity for us to tap into the future. Just to link back to your AI question on this, if you look at the math, we sequentially dropped by 8,000-odd people and year-on-year we dropped by 9,000 people, but we sequentially grew by 2%. And what that really means is a part of it is running with tight utilization. A part of it is related to AI, doing work with lesser number of people, and therefore, creating a productivity benefit for us. So, just to add to the AI -- the reason why some of that is explainable is also because AI and automation is starting to be applied to our projects. So, let me take a shot at it and I'll ask Jatin to add. We don't give the renewal and -- split of renewal and new business, but I can tell you one thing that our new business is significantly higher than the renewals in 2024 versus 2023. So, we're very, very happy about it. The second is there is also new logos and expansion in the bookings. So, we are again very pleased. One of the reasons why Financial Services grew well -- I mean Financial Services grew sequentially after 2022 and it grew well, because we also opened new logos. We started to look for expansion in existing customers. So that's all contributing to our bookings. We had five large deals with more than $100 million and we had two of them with the range of $90 million-plus. In fact, all five of them actually had expansion in new business in the mix. So, we are again very pleased about how the amount of work we're getting, which is new and expansion, is increasing. Of course, the duration of deals is also increasing. On the higher end, I mean the larger deals above $50 million, the duration is increasing. While it creates stickiness, but it also creates a little bit of a tail on -- when the revenue is going to be realized as we go forward. Was there a first part of the question as well, Jonathan? Yeah. So, just to add some more color, Jonathan, on this, we are now at a spot where we have significant attractiveness in the market for employees to join us. I mean, our momentum in the market also allows us, gives us the ability to hire. We also have returners. In fact, we have a historic return of returners as I call it. I mean, it is people coming back who worked at Cognizant before. And our fulfillment engine is a combination of four things: freshers, rotating talent inside the company, reskilling from the adjacencies, and hiring lateral talent. All four, I think, we are getting better and better and better since the last 18 months. So, we are gearing up for a high-demand situation whenever, but we want to be prepared for it. Our two big industries, financial services and healthcare, together is 60% of our business. They're both in great and in a good spot. So that gives us confidence. I mean these were two verticals where Cognizant's legacy and heritage was so strong. So, we are back on those two verticals with a good positive momentum. Yeah. So, large deals -- and Jatin chip-in as I complete. Large deals always have upfront cost and downstream revenue kind of a thing, because you do transition and a lot of these are vendor consolidation, cost optimization kind of deal. So, you will have to invest on transition and everything else. So, there is lumpiness on how that works, but we have now muscle to execute them pretty well. We have done this for 18 months now. We've been on a cycle of winning and delivering the large deals. So we're very confident of continuing on that process. We are not only doing this on application services now, which was the heritage and the historic muscle of Cognizant. We are doing it in BPO and infrastructure services, and now we're starting to see good traction in ER&D and as Belcan comes in subsequently, we will -- hopefully as it gets close, we will hopefully have more of it as well. So, it's a much more comprehensive breadth of capability and the breadth of large deals which we are executing on. We are competing in the market and the levers to compete are not just arbitrage on labor, the levers to compete are also productivity levers powered by automation and AI. And I think we are ahead of the curve. That's one of the reasons why we are winning more. It is a wallet share, which we are picking up from our peers. Jatin, do you want to add anything? Rod, thank you for that question. I've always been a believer of layering performance and change. So, for the first 18 months, I've been constantly making changes and generating performance and using the performance to make more change. At the end of first year, we bought a company called Thirdera, and that was the time I started to believe that performance has changed as you layer it. You also start to get the license to do some big bets. So, we made that big bet of buying Thirdera, which is the single largest ServiceNow standalone company. And right now, they're probably one of the top two players of ServiceNow in the market. And I'm very confident that journey will continue. In the first half of this year, we started to think that -- our business has four vectors, as I said, tech services, BPO, infrastructure-led services, which is security, cloud, everything put together, and ER&D. We always wanted to take another big bet and look for a different bio group and look for a different industry muscle, if I may, and we took a bet on Belcan, which gives us the opportunity to be in aerospace and automotive embedded software and engineering research and development, which is a different buyer group in any of our clients. And we took a bet because we think that's going to increase the breadth of services and it's going to give us a new vector for growth. So, I think I'm going to layer the performance and change on a constant basis and keep looking for big bets so that we make this a resilient platform. Remember, healthcare and financial services, we are heavy on it. Now, we're going to create muscle on manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aerospace, which is going to be a very different industry vector. We are -- we will constantly keep looking for bridging those gaps in new industries and a breadth of capabilities and also expanding internationally as we go forward because we are over indexed on the U.S. So that will be my goal to create sustained momentum and create a resilient platform for our employees and our clients. Rod, that's a great question. Organically, we are seeing strength in automotive. Our pivot on Belcan is very simple. We think the next decade is going to be about digitizing everything physical, so we believe the industries like manufacturing, industrial, automotive, aero. If you pivot into services, which are embedded software, pivot into services, which are digital in nature, there's significant headroom, and there is very little spent in the last 10 years, and therefore, I think the next 10 years are going to be much better. So therefore, I actually believe there are -- there is more space and more room for us. Our concentration is very high in healthcare and financial services. So, this actually gives us much -- a very different industry vertical, but it also gives us an opportunity to bring technology closer to the physical manifestation of these industries. So, that thesis of mind still holds. And I think with AI in the mix now, I actually believe the offerings we will now present to that industry segment are going to be as contemporary, and therefore, will continue to flourish. So that's my thesis when I looked at Belcan and that would be the thesis that it will remain with me even now. Financial Services, we've been working on it since 2023. 2023, we stabilized the teams, we ensured that the leaks we had -- we were on the other side. I mean when consolidation happened, we lost business in 2022. We now are gaining market share when there is consolidation. And we did a very good job of leading that vertical with industry solutions. So that helped us to pivot into some of the small discretionary spend, which is coming back to -- we rallied behind it. So, the industry solution approach, a stable team, walking the corridors, proactively pitching for value-led work, breadth of capability now, I mean, we are no longer a tech services firm, we have a breadth of capability, all of that has helped us to stabilize financial services. Of course, there's going to be variability quarter-on-quarter, but we feel confident about the fact that each one of those subsegments underneath that are in good shape. Our business in Americas and banking has sequentially done pretty well for two quarters in a row. So, now we are starting to progressively take that -- take the same template to -- in the international market, so that we could replicate that success. That's a very good question. In fact, I agree with you that a lot of the consulting dollars are getting diverted to generative AI. I mean, all the way from business case creation to governance to -- some companies are reorganizing their -- I know companies which are now saying, we need to reestablish an enterprise 2.0, so that process and technology can be together and it could be a distributed networked organization versus a hierarchical setup. So, lots of organizational change and experimentation is actually led by generative AI. So, some of the discretionary is getting diverted there. But these are small prototypes, and as you finish the prototypes, you start to see the bottlenecks to take it to production. The good news is at least you start to know what the bottlenecks are and then you start to work on it and then you take them to production grade. I have at least some projects which have started to go production grade. I've mentioned it in my earnings, which is a pharmaceutical company taking generative AI for drug development and insurers using generative AI to support claims which come in, which need to be corrected because there are either fields which have not been filled up or there are clarifications. So, I think at a task level, we are starting to see this go forward. The productivity studies we did in 2023 that helped us also to put the business case up. So, we've seen in healthcare in one of my clients, we've done auto adjudication of claims better using generative AI. So, the ability to make this a very outcome-centric business case will allow us to take this to more production-grade work, and the ability to continue to look for new use cases will help us to build the pipeline as the old ones mature. There's also focus on new logos. So, it's a combination of new logos expansion and new work. And I can certainly tell you that the new work is outpacing the renewals at least in 2024. Just to add to that, I said this before, we are -- we don't see deterioration or improvement. We see the market unchanged, as I call it. However, our execution, our fulfillment rates and our win ratios continue to be very strong. So therefore, we are winning wallet share in a market which has remained unchanged. We have to keep thinking about what are the right ways to tell the market about generative AI. It's a pervasive technology and therefore it diffuses into everything we do. And because it is diffusing so fast, you almost want to say -- you almost don't know what to categorize as Gen AI and what not to categorize as Gen AI. The only thing I can say is in this market, you could win using generative AI, you could increase your win rates, you could create new deals, you could generate more momentum with your clients, equally you could flip it around and use it on your own self to disrupt your own development cycles of our teams and create productivity, which you can share with your clients and then create a flywheel of winnability through it. So, I mean, right now, we are talking about projects which we are doing, we are talking about platforms and how many clients have onboarded on platforms. The traceability to revenues is, I mean, anybody's guess what you call generative AI as generative AI and what you can't. I mean, today, data modernization project or a cloud modernization project, which we do because generative AI is going to be the future, I actually can call it as generative AI or I can say this is not generative AI. However, it is creating more momentum because that foundation is needed for generative AI. So I mean, we have to evolve this to an extent where we could communicate to all of you much -- in a much traceable way. But nobody has found -- I mean, nobody seems to have found the right way to do it. We are trying our best to tell you the traction we have. Thank you so much. Thank you for joining in today and looking forward to the next quarter and thank you for all your support."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions]  \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tyler Scott, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nTyler Scott: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release and the investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2024 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Ravi Kumar, Chief Executive Officer; and Jatin Dalal, Chief Financial Officer.  \n Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during the call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.  \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ravi. Please go ahead. \nRavi Kumar S: Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to make progress against the strategic priorities I laid out last year while navigating a challenging demand environment. We delivered revenue growth that exceeded the high end of our guidance range and expanded our adjusted operating margin year-over-year. Voluntary attrition improved again, and we ended Q1 with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business at 13.1%, representing a decline of 10 percentage points year-over-year. \n And our NextGen program remains on track as we continue to focus on simplification and operational excellence. As we have all seen in recent earnings results for our peer companies and economic headlines, the demand environment remains uncertain and geopolitical risks continue. These dynamics are shifting near-term client spending priorities from discretionary projects towards projects that will drive near-term cost savings and fund innovation for the future.  \n Now moving on to Q1 highlights. We delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, which was sequentially flat and represented a decline of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 15.1% as we continue to execute our cost optimization strategy and take out structural costs. First year -- first quarter bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $25.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year.  \n While there is good sustained traction with our large deals, we saw softness in smaller deals in the range of 0 to $10 million total contract value, reflecting the tight discretionary environment. Our strong deal momentum in the quarter was evidenced by the fact we signed 8 deals, each with TCV of $100 million or more compared to only 4 in the prior year period. We've also seen early green shoots in our efforts to diversify our large deals outside of North America. And in quarter 1, two of the 8 greater than $100 million contracts we signed with in the APJ region.  \n On a trailing 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x remains strong, which we believe provides a healthy backlog of opportunities to improve revenue performance over the next several quarters. We continue to grow our pipeline for larger deals and make progress against our goal of increasing the value of large deals in our bookings.  \n From a segment perspective, demand trends were consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters. We saw sequential growth in Health Sciences and Communications, Media and Technology, offset by declines in Financial Services and Products and Resources. While Financial Services has been impacted more meaningfully than other segments by weaker discretionary spending, we did see sequential growth among our banking and financial services clients, which represents about 60% of our Financial Services segment, and are encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in the overall pipeline, particularly within our intuitive operations and automation practice area.  \n We see several themes that we believe are helping drive demand for our services. This includes clients' continued investments in developing a modern technology infrastructure related to AI, cloud and digital technologies, data engineering, prioritization of hyper-personalization and customer experience projects and the need to deliver innovation. \n One example of infrastructure modernization this quarter was an agreement we signed with a new client, McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor. Over the next 5 years, we will help transform and manage its global technology infrastructure, leveraging AI automated tools to enhance McCormick's employee and customer experience while improving productivity and driving financial savings for our clients.  \n Another example of monetization hyper-personalization is our recently announced new strategic alliance with Shopify and Google Cloud. Under this alliance, we will help drive digital transformation and platform modernization, enabling global retailers and brands to unlock business value from generative AI. We believe today's retailers must drive a modernization agenda while investing in innovation to elevate their end users and customers' experiences. \n Earlier this week, we signed a strategic agreement with Telstra, Australia's leading telecom and technology company, to elevate their software engineering capabilities and enhance their customers' experience. We believe this is a key strategic win in our APJ market. And we will leverage our AI tools to drive innovation, enable more efficient software engineering and ID operations, and decommission legacy systems to improve operational efficiency and support their employee experience by building them a superior engineering experience. \n And as a fourth example, we extended our long-standing relationship with CNO Financial Group during the quarter.  Under this expanded agreement, we will implement cloud and digital technologies to help CNO deliver more personalized digital and convenient solutions to their customers. We'll also leverage gen AI technologies to help drive efficiencies across infrastructure, applications, enterprise software and engineering services. \n Our clients' desire and need to drive innovation is apparent in all our client interactions, but funding for that innovation is being impacted by demand uncertainties in our clients' own end markets. The timing of a return in discretionary spending remains unknown, but our thesis remains simple. We plan to be prepared when it returns by continuing our organic investments in learning and development, people, platforms and innovation, while supporting those initiatives with inorganic capability-enhancing investments. \n On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process for the first quarter of this year shows a 39% improvement in our Net Promoter Score regarding our project delivery quality over the last 2 years. We believe this is a result of a self-reinforcing cycle we created through tighter client collaboration since the beginning of 2023. As a testament to our longtime focus on helping clients innovate, during the quarter, Fortune Magazine recognized Cognizant as one of the America's Most Innovative Companies in 2024.  \n Our focus on innovation is reflected in our Bluebolt grassroots innovation initiative, which we launched a year ago in April. Bluebolt has already generated more than 130,000 ideas from our associates, 23,000 of which have been implemented with clients. Overall, more than 220,000 Cognizant associates have been trained on Bluebolt. \n In addition, Google named Cognizant a Google Cloud 2024 Breakthrough Partner of the Year. This is one of our industry's most distinguished awards. I will elaborate more on Google Cloud in a moment. And just this month, LinkedIn recognized Cognizant as a #3 on its Top Companies 2024 Employer List in India, which is home to more than 250,000 of our valued associates. This repeat recognition is a reminder that our focus on becoming the employer of choice is paying off in the country that is at the heart of Cognizant's success in India. \n These client wins and industry recognitions demonstrate one of our core differentiators, our collaborative innovation. And nowhere else is the demand for innovation higher than in gen AI. To date, we have more than 450 early client engagements in more than 500 additional opportunities in the pipeline. We have seen increased demand for AI services across 4 key areas. \n First, customer and employee experience as clients seek to deliver improved interactions through hyper-personalization. Second, content summarization and insights to empower decision-making. Third, content generation. And finally, leveraging gen AI to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles.  \n We continue to see strong interest from clients as they assess proofs of concept and the return on investment of these opportunities. These efforts are supported by our recently launched Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab in San Francisco, where we are investing in state-of-the-art core AI research aimed to position us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. This builds upon our network of AI innovation studios in London, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Bengaluru. Incidentally, our Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab has already produced 53 AI patents with applications for many more pending. This quarter alone, we had 7 new AI patents approved and granted to us. In quarter 1, we announced a series of new partnerships and co-innovations behind this strategy we announced last year to invest $1 billion in generative AI over 3 years.  \n This includes our collaboration with Microsoft to infuse gen AI into health care administration. The TriZetto Assistant on our Facets platform will leverage Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel to provide access to gen AI within the TriZetto user interface. We are already progressing from proof of concept to the piloting phase and are seeing strong interest from some of our largest health care customers. \n And last week, we announced another element of our expanded partnership with Microsoft. We plan to leverage Microsoft Copilot and Cognizant's advisory and digital transformation services to help our employees and enterprise customers operationalize generative AI and realize strategic business transformation benefits from this technology.  \n In addition, as a part of Cognizant's Synapse skilling program, Cognizant will train 25,000 developers of the use of Github Copilot, doubling the number trained on the technology. \n We are also collaborating with NVIDIA to leverage our deep life sciences and AI domain expertise with NVIDIA's pretrained industry-specific generative AI models offered as a part of BioNeMo. There -- through this collaboration, we will provide clients access to a suite of model-making services, including pretrained models, cutting-edge frameworks and application programming interfaces, that offer clients an accelerated path to train and customize enterprise models using the proprietary data. By leveraging gen AI-infused models, clinical researchers can rapidly sift through extensive data sets, more accurately predict interactions between drug compounds and create a new viable drug development pathway.\n We also expanded our partnership with Google Cloud. We'll adopt Gemini for Google Cloud in two ways: first, by training Cognizant associates to use Gemini for software development assistance; and second, by integrating Gemini's advanced capabilities within Cognizant's internal operations and platforms. Using Gemini for Google Cloud, Cognizant's developers will be equipped to write, test and deploy code faster and more effectively with the help of AI-powered tools, improving the reliability and cost efficiency of building and managing client applications.  \n Over the next 12 months, Cognizant expects to up-skill more than 70,000 cross-functional associates on Google Cloud's AI offerings. This is another milestone in our Synapse initiative to up-skill 1 million individuals globally by 2026. Additionally, Cognizant will work to integrate Gemini into its suite of automated platforms and accelerators beginning with the recently announced Cognizant Flowsource platform for developers. \n As a part of our social responsibility platform, we recently announced that since 2018, we have awarded $70 million in philanthropic funds to global skilling programs for underrepresented communities. These 117 grants combined Cognizant's culture of continuous skilling, our focus on prioritization on empowering diversity through technology, and the philosophy that AI and other advanced technologies can be a great equalizer for the future of work. We intend to continue following and participating in the AI innovation cycles by investing in last-mile platform infrastructure, productivity studies and capabilities to enable better and faster integration into enterprise landscapes.  \n In the last 12 months, our AI platforms gained significant traction as we on-boarded clients on the Neuro, Skygrade and Flowsource platforms to cover various phases of AI deployment cycles. By investing in productivity studies, which dissect the anatomy of skills and occupations and map the AI exposure scores to different roles, we have assisted our clients in realizing value and driving the scaled embrace of newer AI use cases. \n As we continue to navigate this ongoing soft demand environment, we remain focused on investing in areas to help our clients reduce total cost of ownership, boost productivity, enhance technology intensity and enable better adoption of new age technologies like AI to capture the current demand and be prepared for the future. And we remain differentiated by investing in industry domain capabilities and platforms in select industries. \n We also believe inorganic opportunities remain an important element of our investment strategy. We continue to seek to expand and deepen capabilities, diversify our business, including into industries where we are underexposed and improve our geographic mix. \n For example, we are pleased with the early traction of our Q1 acquisition of Thirdera, an industry-leading ServiceNow platform, which has significantly expanded our capabilities and credentials. We already see a healthy pipeline of opportunities as direct result of this acquisition to cross-sell within our existing client base.  \n In closing, I want to thank our 345,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our clients and Cognizant. In 2024, we will keep working to increase our revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry, and to simplify our operations. Jatin, over to you. \nJatin Dalal: Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us.  \n As I enter my sixth month as Cognizant's CFO, I remain deeply impressed by the culture, passion and client centricity across the organization. I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter in what remains a tough economic environment. Revenue exited the high end of our guidance range, supported by our Communications, Media and Technology segments. The sequential growth of our healthcare segment was also heartening. Strong execution on our NextGen program and disciplined cost optimization actions allowed us to deliver a 15.1% adjusted operating margin, representing 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year.  \n Looking ahead, I am focused on several objectives in support of our broader strategic priorities. First, continue to strengthen our partnerships and collaborations across the organization to improve revenue growth. Second, improve our margin profile through our NextGen cost programs and process enhancements, driven in part by leveraging AI tools. Next, continue to invest in our people with a focus on supporting our company-wide employee skilling programs designed to train our employees on the latest technology, including gen AI. And finally, drive disciplined execution with a focus on maximizing value creation from our M&A investments and improving our large deals risk management framework.  \n First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.1% year-over-year or a decline of 1.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 70 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, revenue was flat from the prior quarter. Across global industry segments and geographies, we have seen the uncertain economic outlook and volatile geopolitical environment weigh on our client spending priorities, which has kept their discretionary spend muted. These headwinds are more pronounced in Financial Services, which is more susceptible to higher interest rates. Health Sciences customers are also being impacted by the inflationary environment and industry-specific headwinds.  \n At the same time, clients continue to prioritize spending that can deliver cost savings quickly and continue to fund investments in transformation and innovation. For example, within our Products and Resources segment, we have seen resiliency among utility customers where grid modernization remains a critical priority. This has been further supported by our 2022 acquisitions of Utegration, which helps drive SAP S/4 cloud opportunities with the utilities customers. In addition, we have seen positive trends amongst automotive customers in area like software-defined vehicles and in our Products and Resources segment, where the convergence of IT and operational technology is driving transformation and digitization priorities.  \n Finally, we were pleased with the performance of our Communications, Media and Technology segment, which grew year-over-year, driven by contribution of recently completed acquisitions and wins with the communications and media customers. This has helped offset discretionary spending pressure among our technology customers, which we believe have been impacted by clients focused on reducing costs.  \n Now moving on to margins. Our NextGen optimization program has progressed well in helping us drive structural cost savings and simplification of our operations. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $23 million of costs related to this program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, which benefited from savings related to our NextGen program and the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Both our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter were 24.8%. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.10 and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.12. \n Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. DSO of 78 days was up 1 day sequentially and increased 5 days year-over-year, primarily driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million and included the impact of previously disclosed $360 million payments made to Indian tax authorities as well as the payout of bonuses that were accrued last year.  As a reminder, the tax payment to the Indian tax authority was required to proceed with the appeals process relating to our 2016 tax matter. The appeal is ongoing and final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due to tax authorities will be determined at the end of the process. \n We also returned $284 million to shareholders, including $133 million through share repurchases and $151 million through our regular remit. In addition, we completed our acquisition of Thirdera in January for a total consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $420 million. These factors drove quarter end cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion.  \n In 2024, we continue to expect to return over $1 billion to our shareholders, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to evaluate inorganic strategic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth profile, expand our capabilities and diversify our portfolio. \n Now let me speak about the forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to growth of 1.5% sequentially, in constant currency.  Year-over-year, this implies a decline of 2.5% to a decline of 1% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to a revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.9% to a decline of 1.4%. \n For the full year, we continue to expect a revenue decline of 2% to a growth of 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to revenue in range of $18.9 billion to $19.7 billion and a decline of 2.2% to a growth of 1.8%, reflecting our latest exchange assumptions. The guidance we are providing as of today assumes up to 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. We see an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities, and we continue to evaluate assets for the right capabilities to support our strategic priorities. Our NextGen program remains on track, and there are no changes to our assumptions regarding the program. We still intend to reinvest the majority of NextGen savings in our growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond.  \n Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our Q1 performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. For Q2, we expect adjusted operating margin will be in a narrow range around Q1's number, with NextGen cost savings and improved utilization being offset by initial negative impact from the ramp of large deals and the revenue mix. I am pleased with our sequential improvement in utilization during the quarter, and we are sharply focused on driving further improvements to support margins next quarter.  \n For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $60 million, which compares to $40 million previously, primarily reflecting updated interest rate and cash balances assumptions. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged, and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of our net income. This includes the previously discussed negative impact of $360 million payment made with Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter.\n Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.50 to $4.68, unchanged from our previous guidance. With that, we'll open the call for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. \nBryan Bergin: I guess to start, can you comment on what areas performed better than your expectations here on growth in 1Q versus your guide? And then as we see an implied sequential improvement in the coming quarters, at least at the midpoint, how do we reconcile that with some of the commentary about the unknown timing of discretionary recovery? I'm curious if it's kind of an improvement driven by the ramp of the large deals and easier comps or if you're actually forecasting some improvement in that discretionary -- in that decision-making environment too. \nRavi Kumar S: Thank you, Bryan. Thank you for that question. This is Ravi here, and let me give it a try, and then I will ask Jatin to add in. The way we look at our guidance range is based on the visibility we get to the middle of the range. And then we look for what's the upside available. The upside available is based on large deal momentum. There is 30 to 40 basis points of M&A, which we are yet to do because this guidance includes 100 basis points of M&A. And the committed spend from many of our clients, sometimes, you can get an upside on it if you ramp up well. So that's the starting point. \n Why did we put this in a broad range? We put it in a broad range -- normally, at this point of time, you would have 200 basis points of range. We have 400 basis points of a range because the market is sluggish. While we are doing well, we've performed well in quarter 1, the market is sluggish, so we kind of kept a broader range. \n How do we see discretionary today? We don't see discretionary changed since we spoke to all of you last quarter. So it remains the same. It hasn't changed. Now let's come to performance of quarter 1. If you've noticed, I mean, the biggest drop in discretionary has been in Financial Services in the past. And that has been for us as well as for the sector and the industry. If you've noticed, the sequential drop from quarter 4 to quarter 1 for us is only $10 million in banking, financial services and insurance. And we are seeing green shoots in BFS, which is 60% of BFSI. \n Health care is doing well. We have managed to continue on our strong portfolio with sequential growth. You've heard about communications, CMT, it's been a phenomenal run for us. We have had year-on-year growth as well as sequential growth that is backed by some large deals we won in the last 12 months. \n This is also a quarter where we have 8 large deals. If you compare that with quarter 1 of last year, it is 4 large deals last year. And these -- out of the 8, 5 were expansion plus renewal, and that gives me a lot of confidence about the fact that we're continuing to expand on large deals. The large deal momentum continues. Of course, there is softness in 0 to $10 million and 0 to $20 million of kind of deals, which are discretionary in [ India ]. So that's broadly how I shape it. \n And if I have to add manufacturing and products, that is pretty stable. So this is how I see how we got to the guidance range. This is how we performed in quarter 1. We have also seen expansion of our deals outside of Americas to Asia Pacific. We have 2 deals out of the 8, which have actually come from Asia Pacific. You've already seen the announcement we did with Telstra, which is a part of our release. Jatin, anything else? \nJatin Dalal: Yes. No, Bryan, we are good. If you have any follow-up, we can take it. \nBryan Bergin: No, that was very detailed. I appreciate that. My thoughts on margin, so just kind of unpacking the margin attribution with the gross margin contraction year-over-year but a strong SG&A reduction. Is that a trend we should expect that will continue as you move through '24, just given the large deal ramping? And just maybe, Jatin, talk about your comfort level in reducing the SG&A profile in NextGen still? \nJatin Dalal: There will be puts and takes every quarter, as you very well know. But directionally, SG&A should continue to show a right momentum around improvement, but not so much because we have taken a large action in '23. So you would see the [ back ] end of our NextGen program acting through the SG&A line during the course of the rest of the year, but it won't be as large an impact or a big number compared to 2023. That's the view on SG&A. \nRavi Kumar S: I would say the only thing I would add to what Jatin said is SG&A also has leverage with growth. So if growth comes back, you will see leverage on SG&A. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Just following on Bryan's question there. Just thinking about bookings ahead in the second quarter, maybe second half as well. Any call-outs there around expectations, new deals or logos versus renewals, short versus large? What do you see on the horizon there? \nRavi Kumar S: Tien-Tsin, thank you so much for that question. We continue to see good large deals momentum through the whole of 2023. I mean, whatever we did in 2023 is helping us on ramp-ups this year, and we'll continue to build that for the rest of the year. This has been a good quarter. In fact, if you just see the announcements we made with clients as a part of our earnings release, you would notice that the number of announcements have also gone up. So I'm very pleased with the progress. I'm also pleased with the fact that we have now started to expand that into Europe and Asia Pacific. \n The softer nature of smaller deals between 0 to $10 million and, I would say, 0 to $15 million or $20 million, that hasn't changed much since we spoke last. And it's hard to predict how that's going to look like for the rest of the year. I do see some improvements, some green shoots in it, and that is reflected in our Financial Services BFSI results, but we should -- we are continuing to watch that area very keenly. \n Essentially, most of the large deals are on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, productivity, efficiency kind of deals. And we are very, very excited about the fact that, that momentum is going to continue for us. Those are deals the market offers, and we are -- we seem to be winning well on that. Of course, the period -- because these large deals are cost-takeout deals, the period of -- the duration of those deals is longer, so you will see realization of revenues over a period of time. \n But it is also sticky, and it gives you an opportunity to create better fulfillment through managed services. So one of the other things we are tracking internally is annual contract value in addition to the total contract value, so that we start to know how much is it contributing to this year. What will be exciting for us is we now have a runway from 2023 into 2024. And going into 2025, we'll have a runway from 2024. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Keane: I just wanted to ask about pricing in the environment right now since demand is low. Wondering if you're seeing pressure on the rate card in the industry right now? And any kind of bottom insight for that? \nJatin Dalal: Yes. Bryan, thanks for your question. This is Jatin. Fundamentally, the current environment is that of consolidation of spend, of cost management, improvement in the productivity and so on and so forth. So this is the characteristics of the deals that we are seeing in the market. By design, these deals come with an expectation of superior pricing than what is the pricing which is inherent in the current work. So yes, there is a downward pressure on pricing, but it is nothing out of ordinary that one would expect in the current demand environment. We are not seeing out-of-ordinary behavior in the market as we compete. And I think it's a fair play from that expectation standpoint. \nBryan Keane: Got it. And then as my follow-up, you mentioned that normally, you guys would narrow the range for the revenue guide, but you've kept it due to some of the uncertainties. What would need to happen for you guys to get towards the high end of the range? Would you need some of that short-term demand work to come back? And would it even come back fast enough to hit the P&L to impact this fiscal year to get up towards the, I think, 2% constant currency revenue range? \nJatin Dalal: Sure. So overall, the reason for large -- a larger range is as follows. I mean, as Ravi mentioned, we start with the midpoint and we look at what is the expected outcome that one can get to. Then we see the range of possibilities. Now if you see our own guidance vis-a-vis quarter 1 to quarter 2, there is an improvement in the guidance range that we gave in --  we are giving in quarter 2 versus quarter 1. And that also means that we will grow sequentially in quarter 2. So overall, we are making good progress. But if you see the demand environment remains reasonably tough, no different than what we spoke in the beginning of the year. And hence, there is a sort of uncertainty in the environment that we are factoring in as we look at our own performance as well as we look at the environment, which is surrounding us. \n Now what can help us go towards the higher end of the range are a few things, and one or more of this could help us. One is that there is some improvement in discretionary spend in the later part of the year. The second is, as Ravi mentioned earlier, a lot of times, when we win a large deal, there is a committed business and there is a right to go after sort of business, which is not committed. But if you fulfill well, if your delivery is good, you can naturally go after that upside to the committed business. That's second. \n The third is we spoke about the inorganic component of our guidance. We have maybe 30 to 40 basis points of potential to execute on. And that could mean in the second half, that could get added to the performance because we have done only one acquisition since the beginning of the year. And fourth is sometimes, a re-batch kind of deal, which comes with a large volume of revenue getting ramped up at a relatively faster pace than the normal ramp-up that you see in a deal. So one or more of this could be at play. \n Right now, we have remained sort of true to our original guidance. We will narrow the range when we meet you next time. But right now, considering all of this, sitting where we are in the year, we thought we'll keep the range same as it was in the beginning of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Lee with Guggenheim Securities. \nYu Lee: Ravi, given your call-out in your prepared remarks to your commentary, can you talk through any sort of deal leakage or cancellations or delays you may have seen in recent months? And if so, across which types of projects or verticals are you seeing this in? \nRavi Kumar S: Yes. So let me start and get Jatin to add. Discretionary has to be earned every year, so the discretionary doesn't come back. You could call it as structural leakage, if I may, but it isn't as much. It's not like somebody else is taking that away. So discretionary is always the unknown part, if I may. On the -- when I started the year in 2023, we had leakages because when there was a consolidation, somebody else was winning it and not us. That isn't happening anymore. I mean we are very stable with our clients. Our clients are continuing to invest in customers. There's no company-specific challenges, which have led to leakage or there is a potential of leakage. We see that as a very stable platform. \n In fact, my Net Promoter Scores with the clients is continuing to scale up every quarter since 2023. Our attrition rates have fallen significantly, the 10 percentage points we have dropped Y-o-Y this quarter. That's an important part of what clients trust, providers like us. So there is no structural leakage, if I may. \n The discretionary, which is -- the behavior of discretionary spend leads to it not coming back sometimes, coming back in shorter spurts, coming back in a delayed way. Those are the ones you would be watchful about. So that's broadly how I see it. I mean most of the managed services deals, we are winning, both with existing clients, new business as well, some which are proactively bid. We are on the winning side. We are mostly on the winning side in the last, I would say, 15 months or so. \nJatin Dalal: Yes. And if I just add a perspective of the deals that we have won in last, let's say, 18 months. Typically, you would see that compared to what you expected at the time when you won the deal, typically, you will go sometimes faster because you are fulfilling better, you are executing better than what you initially thought and customer thought. And sometimes, it would be slower because there are more change management issues they need to deal with, et cetera. So I think we are evenly placed regarding the pace versus expectation. I don't see anything out of ordinary. There will always be one of the deals that is taking a little longer time to ramp up because there is some change in the client organization, but nothing that is out of ordinary on a win versus execution of the deal. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. \nJason Kupferberg: I just wanted to start on gen AI. I kind of had a 2-part question there because I know, Ravi, you mentioned rural gen AI and accelerating software development a couple of times. Just curious what your longer-term views are on role of a human software developer will change as gen AI tools potentially do more of the actual coding. And then just you mentioned 450 active gen AI client engagements. Can you give us a sense of the average project size there? \nRavi Kumar S: Thank you, Jason. The 450 -- let me start with the first one. The 450-odd client engagements, we've come a long way. If you remember, in quarter 2, 2023, we spoke about 100, and now we have 400 early client engagements. And these are very short prototype, rapid prototype kind of deals. 500 of them -- more than 500 of them, we have in the pipeline, and the thing to watch for now is how many of these will go into scaled execution for our clients. And that's where the monetize-able opportunities are. So we are continuing to work on it. \n There are broadly 2 things we are investing on -- or rather, three: first, follow the innovation cycles of AI; second, build the last-mile infrastructure so that the raw power of AI can be made production grade, enterprise grade for our clients. That means last-mile infrastructure related to managing AI platforms, orchestration. In case of AI and like other discontinuities, how do you improve the accuracy of the models? How do you create explainability because this is a black box? How do you create explainability? How do you create observability? So all of those platforms we have built and we have announced is the last-mile infrastructure I kind of referred to, which helps us to take the drop over and make it production grade. \n The second thing we're investing on is productivity studies. I mean, what does AI do to different roles and different operations of different industries? And how do we make embrace of AI much faster on larger cohorts? And we partnered with Oxford Economics and we created templates for every industry, every role, so that we can do an anatomy of tasks, as I call it. And then we then start to figure out how to create a much faster and a much broader embrace in enterprises. So this is preparing for the future where we believe enterprises are going to be a people-plus-machine endeavor. \n Now what does it do to our operating model? Our tech for tech, as I call it. It, of course, changes the productivity of a developer. When the cloud came into picture a couple of years ago, it flipped the productivity where, as a developer, you spend very little time on the plumbing, but you spend a lot of time on innovation. You spend a lot of time on building. This is our second shot at improving developer productivity and not actually spending time on repetitive tasks, not actually spending time on things which a machine can write, but you could actually pivot the developer productivity on innovation. So this is the second shot at it. And I would believe this is probably more disruptive than what the cloud did. And we think what will happen is this will lead to reducing backlog, improving the throughput to our clients, increasing the tech intensity at a lower cost. \n So I always believe that this is going to be an opportunity than a threat if we can pivot ourselves well. And the opportunity is about creating the tech intensity. Every industry doesn't have that intensity, so we have this unique opportunity to create that intensity at a lower cost and a lower entry barrier. I mean you don't need to be a developer to embrace software code, which means the entry barrier goes down. So we think we have a bigger opportunity than before as long as we can embrace this into our own landscape and equally build the use cases for our clients to embrace it. So I see this as a uniquely big opportunity for companies like Cognizant. \nJason Kupferberg: That's good color. And then just a quick follow-up. You mentioned 8 large deals you won in the quarter, $100 million-plus TCV, I think. Are those expected to contribute materially to 2024 revenue? And if so, were they already contemplated in your original revenue guidance? \nRavi Kumar S: Yes, I mean the visibility we have so far on the deals we have won, we have baked it into our guidance range. But Jason, you know this, the deals we won last year have a better throughput this year. And the deals we win this year will have a better throughput in the second half of this year and in 2025. The challenge in 2023 was we did have that backlog as we got into 2023 because we were not playing on large deals. Right now, I don't have that challenge because I had a good, healthy pipeline in 2023 that's contributing to 2024. And then we keep doing this in the same sustained manner, we will exit into 2025 with tail velocity. So the first year is normally lower than the second year. And by the end of the second year, you get to the run rate you have to. Normally, the span of the deals has changed. Earlier, it used to be lower. Now, it's 3.5 years or plus because large deals now come on a cost-takeout model, unlike transformation related to -- unlike transformation-related large deals. \n But once we start to execute and get the bid versus bid in a good shape, then the committed spend will then flip over to new spend because you're already in the groove. So that's what we are betting on as well. I mean, once you start to perform well, you have the license to take more from our clients. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. \nJames Faucette: Wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. You kind of laid out what needed to happen, particularly in the return of discretionary deals in order to get to the high end of your guidance range. Conversely, what would be the scenario in your mind that would end up with you towards the lower end of that guided range? I mean, are we looking at incremental pushouts and delays of starting of deals? Or I'm just trying to get a gauge there on the bottom end. \nJatin Dalal: Yes, sure. So if you do that mathematically, I'm sure you already looked at those numbers, and those numbers really mean a very flattish performance for rest of the year and a negative performance that typically happens in quarter 4, given the furloughs. So that's the sort of trajectory we are looking at if markets really tanked and our performance didn't show any positive progress. \nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then there's been a lot of talk about the transformational or discretionary deals and more focus on transformation. And it seems like that that's directly impacting your bookings and the types of things that you're able to put in into the pipeline right now. But is that having any impact on what you're doing from a hiring or skilling perspective? And how should we think about that as we go into next year if this kind of environment persists? Are there other considerations we should be taking into account in terms of how you'll be hiring and what impact that could have on profitability, et cetera? \nRavi Kumar S: Yes. So discretionary is small projects. Normally, in smaller projects, you have a different kind of a pyramid versus large deals, where you have a much healthy pyramid, if I may. So with discretionary -- normally, when discretionary comes in, you hire more lateral hires with experience. And when you deal with managed services deals, you hire the pyramid because the pyramid rightly fits in there. So that's probably how it is. \n If you've noticed, we improved utilization from quarter 4 to quarter 1. So that gave us the extra runway, and we'll continue to sharpen our utilization. So that gives us the continued extra runway to grow and keep the engine agile enough to hire the senior people you need and rotate the people from existing teams into newer projects as that happens. So I think we have that agility now on our fulfillment engines. \n I'm very pleased not just about the -- how we have tackled the demand environment. We're very pleased with what we have done on utilization and what we have done on fulfillment of deals we have won as well as getting prepared for the discretionary spend whenever it eventually comes back. So the engine is as agile enough for the current demand situation as well as if there is a spike in the demand. We think we are well placed to seize those opportunities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. \nMoshe Katri: It's Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Ravi, congrats on strong execution in a pretty tough environment. I just want to go back to the booking kind of metrics, 1.3x book-to-bill. Is there a way to kind of break it down by new logos to the renewals and extensions and maybe compared to last year of, I guess, you mentioned ACV? I think you said bookings on a 12-month basis were up 1%. Is there a way to kind of get the same comps for ACVs? \nRavi Kumar S: Moshe, good to hear from you. So we do have that visibility. We have not published that externally. What we track is multiple things. We track the total contract value, the size of the deals, the duration of the deals, how much of that translates to ACV for this year and ACV for the next year, so for the first 12 months or the next 12 months. And we also track the pyramid attached to it and the capability set needed. So I pretty much have that information to rely on so that we can get our fulfillment engine intact as well as forecast better. So it is something we have. We have not published that externally, but I'm keeping a constant track on it. \n And in the book-to-bill ratios, Moshe, you know this, it also depends on what are the duration of the deals. I'm sure you asked this question because of that. The duration of the deals, when you take large deals, they go up. When you take small deals, it goes down. So the book-to-bill has a meaningful impact between the 2. So one of the other metrics we are internally tracking is ACV because then that gives us what is the incremental revenue we'll get for the current calendar year. So it's a combination of things you have to put together to get to a point where you know how much is it going to incrementally contribute to growth. \nMoshe Katri: Okay. And then is there a way to get that mix of new logos to renewals? Or that's also kind of internal and you don't disclose that? \nRavi Kumar S: So we have had a very healthy new logo program, Moshe. Since I've come on board, we have a specific program for new logos. We also have a program to ramp new logos to, say, a $50 million or $100 million client, an annual spend of $100 million, $50 million client. I mean opening new logos is one thing, but ramping them up to a $50 million account is another thing. So we have put both swim lanes. We're very, very active in our journey. \n We also have a target list now of new logos and geo-based. And we have kind of separated that from the mining engine because the hunting engine has to -- the hunting engine is humming very well. And there's a transition to the mining engine as the annual size of those accounts changes. \n What we have not done is we have not expressed this to our market on how many new logos we are opening, and we have not created that information pack in the external market. But internally, we're very, very pleased with where we are on new logos and how we are ramping it up. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman with SIG. \nJames Friedman: Jatin, I just want to make sure I'm understanding how you're thinking about the shape of the year. If I take the midpoint of your Q2 sequential and if I make the assumption that the Q4 is flat, and I know in most years, it's not, but just for simple math, I'm getting about a 2.5% sequential in the Q3. Does that sound about right to you? \nJatin Dalal: I'm -- I don't have the math in front of me, but yes, I mean, qualitatively, I would agree with you that we'll have to have a strong quarter 3 and a flattish quarter 4 for us to get to the -- towards the higher range -- higher end of our range, for sure. \nJames Friedman: Okay. And then Ravi, you, I think, used the word green shoot in the context of the BFS letters in BFSI. And it's the first time I've heard your company or most companies use that language with those 3 letters in years. Can you elaborate on that? \nRavi Kumar S: Yes. So the context was if you look at the last few quarters of sequential drop in BFS, you would notice that the sequential drop is relatively smaller between quarter 4 and quarter 1. So something has happened in between. So in the last 12 months, we have worked on reorganizing our BFSI vertical. We have energized the teams with some new hires. We have now a exceptionally good list of offerings. I mean, I now have an operating list for banking and financial services or for insurance. We have opened doors on fintech. We have taken AI and created small discretionary spend opportunities for ourselves. Just to give you a sense in insurance, we have quite a few AI projects running. So we have a variety of things happening. \n I'll give you one or 2 examples. In insurance, there is mainframe modernization, which is a important initiative. In P&C insurance, there is digitizing the distribution network, which is primarily agents and platforms. The group benefits and the policy admin platforms are going through a significant change. In banking and financial services, customer service is going through a significant transformation. So we have an offering that -- and it is an offering which is bundled with AI. \n We have fraud detection and prevention, which is an important opportunity. The regional banks are going through massive cost takeout. We have an offering out there. So I think we now have -- I mean, there is a market reality of what is happening in BFSI. And there is the organizational strength to counter that market reality. So we are a stable shop with all the offerings in place with the right teams, and we are climbing up the ladder. We are trying everything we can in a tough market. \nJatin Dalal: Yes. Sorry, Jamie. I just add to what I just said before. It's -- I want to go back to what I said in response to an earlier question saying, our expected likely outcome is what we see at the midpoint of the guidance. And then we see the range of possibility on the both ends. And when you specifically asked, I was reacting to the range of possibility on the upper end. I mean, I just want to reflect accordingly so that I respond to you in its completeness. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ravi Kumar S",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and good afternoon, everyone.  \n Thank you for joining our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, we continued to make progress against the strategic priorities I laid out last year while navigating a challenging demand environment. We delivered revenue growth that exceeded the high end of our guidance range and expanded our adjusted operating margin year-over-year. Voluntary attrition improved again, and we ended Q1 with trailing 12-month voluntary attrition for our technology services business at 13.1%, representing a decline of 10 percentage points year-over-year. \n And our NextGen program remains on track as we continue to focus on simplification and operational excellence. As we have all seen in recent earnings results for our peer companies and economic headlines, the demand environment remains uncertain and geopolitical risks continue. These dynamics are shifting near-term client spending priorities from discretionary projects towards projects that will drive near-term cost savings and fund innovation for the future.  \n Now moving on to Q1 highlights. We delivered revenue of $4.8 billion, which was sequentially flat and represented a decline of 1% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 15.1% as we continue to execute our cost optimization strategy and take out structural costs. First year -- first quarter bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $25.9 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year.  \n While there is good sustained traction with our large deals, we saw softness in smaller deals in the range of 0 to $10 million total contract value, reflecting the tight discretionary environment. Our strong deal momentum in the quarter was evidenced by the fact we signed 8 deals, each with TCV of $100 million or more compared to only 4 in the prior year period. We've also seen early green shoots in our efforts to diversify our large deals outside of North America. And in quarter 1, two of the 8 greater than $100 million contracts we signed with in the APJ region.  \n On a trailing 12-month basis, our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x remains strong, which we believe provides a healthy backlog of opportunities to improve revenue performance over the next several quarters. We continue to grow our pipeline for larger deals and make progress against our goal of increasing the value of large deals in our bookings.  \n From a segment perspective, demand trends were consistent with what we have seen in recent quarters. We saw sequential growth in Health Sciences and Communications, Media and Technology, offset by declines in Financial Services and Products and Resources. While Financial Services has been impacted more meaningfully than other segments by weaker discretionary spending, we did see sequential growth among our banking and financial services clients, which represents about 60% of our Financial Services segment, and are encouraged by the opportunities we are seeing in the overall pipeline, particularly within our intuitive operations and automation practice area.  \n We see several themes that we believe are helping drive demand for our services. This includes clients' continued investments in developing a modern technology infrastructure related to AI, cloud and digital technologies, data engineering, prioritization of hyper-personalization and customer experience projects and the need to deliver innovation. \n One example of infrastructure modernization this quarter was an agreement we signed with a new client, McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor. Over the next 5 years, we will help transform and manage its global technology infrastructure, leveraging AI automated tools to enhance McCormick's employee and customer experience while improving productivity and driving financial savings for our clients.  \n Another example of monetization hyper-personalization is our recently announced new strategic alliance with Shopify and Google Cloud. Under this alliance, we will help drive digital transformation and platform modernization, enabling global retailers and brands to unlock business value from generative AI. We believe today's retailers must drive a modernization agenda while investing in innovation to elevate their end users and customers' experiences. \n Earlier this week, we signed a strategic agreement with Telstra, Australia's leading telecom and technology company, to elevate their software engineering capabilities and enhance their customers' experience. We believe this is a key strategic win in our APJ market. And we will leverage our AI tools to drive innovation, enable more efficient software engineering and ID operations, and decommission legacy systems to improve operational efficiency and support their employee experience by building them a superior engineering experience. \n And as a fourth example, we extended our long-standing relationship with CNO Financial Group during the quarter.  Under this expanded agreement, we will implement cloud and digital technologies to help CNO deliver more personalized digital and convenient solutions to their customers. We'll also leverage gen AI technologies to help drive efficiencies across infrastructure, applications, enterprise software and engineering services. \n Our clients' desire and need to drive innovation is apparent in all our client interactions, but funding for that innovation is being impacted by demand uncertainties in our clients' own end markets. The timing of a return in discretionary spending remains unknown, but our thesis remains simple. We plan to be prepared when it returns by continuing our organic investments in learning and development, people, platforms and innovation, while supporting those initiatives with inorganic capability-enhancing investments. \n On the client side, data from our project-level client feedback process for the first quarter of this year shows a 39% improvement in our Net Promoter Score regarding our project delivery quality over the last 2 years. We believe this is a result of a self-reinforcing cycle we created through tighter client collaboration since the beginning of 2023. As a testament to our longtime focus on helping clients innovate, during the quarter, Fortune Magazine recognized Cognizant as one of the America's Most Innovative Companies in 2024.  \n Our focus on innovation is reflected in our Bluebolt grassroots innovation initiative, which we launched a year ago in April. Bluebolt has already generated more than 130,000 ideas from our associates, 23,000 of which have been implemented with clients. Overall, more than 220,000 Cognizant associates have been trained on Bluebolt. \n In addition, Google named Cognizant a Google Cloud 2024 Breakthrough Partner of the Year. This is one of our industry's most distinguished awards. I will elaborate more on Google Cloud in a moment. And just this month, LinkedIn recognized Cognizant as a #3 on its Top Companies 2024 Employer List in India, which is home to more than 250,000 of our valued associates. This repeat recognition is a reminder that our focus on becoming the employer of choice is paying off in the country that is at the heart of Cognizant's success in India. \n These client wins and industry recognitions demonstrate one of our core differentiators, our collaborative innovation. And nowhere else is the demand for innovation higher than in gen AI. To date, we have more than 450 early client engagements in more than 500 additional opportunities in the pipeline. We have seen increased demand for AI services across 4 key areas. \n First, customer and employee experience as clients seek to deliver improved interactions through hyper-personalization. Second, content summarization and insights to empower decision-making. Third, content generation. And finally, leveraging gen AI to accelerate innovation and technology development cycles.  \n We continue to see strong interest from clients as they assess proofs of concept and the return on investment of these opportunities. These efforts are supported by our recently launched Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab in San Francisco, where we are investing in state-of-the-art core AI research aimed to position us at the forefront of innovation in our industry. This builds upon our network of AI innovation studios in London, New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Bengaluru. Incidentally, our Advanced Artificial Intelligence Lab has already produced 53 AI patents with applications for many more pending. This quarter alone, we had 7 new AI patents approved and granted to us. In quarter 1, we announced a series of new partnerships and co-innovations behind this strategy we announced last year to invest $1 billion in generative AI over 3 years.  \n This includes our collaboration with Microsoft to infuse gen AI into health care administration. The TriZetto Assistant on our Facets platform will leverage Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel to provide access to gen AI within the TriZetto user interface. We are already progressing from proof of concept to the piloting phase and are seeing strong interest from some of our largest health care customers. \n And last week, we announced another element of our expanded partnership with Microsoft. We plan to leverage Microsoft Copilot and Cognizant's advisory and digital transformation services to help our employees and enterprise customers operationalize generative AI and realize strategic business transformation benefits from this technology.  \n In addition, as a part of Cognizant's Synapse skilling program, Cognizant will train 25,000 developers of the use of Github Copilot, doubling the number trained on the technology. \n We are also collaborating with NVIDIA to leverage our deep life sciences and AI domain expertise with NVIDIA's pretrained industry-specific generative AI models offered as a part of BioNeMo. There -- through this collaboration, we will provide clients access to a suite of model-making services, including pretrained models, cutting-edge frameworks and application programming interfaces, that offer clients an accelerated path to train and customize enterprise models using the proprietary data. By leveraging gen AI-infused models, clinical researchers can rapidly sift through extensive data sets, more accurately predict interactions between drug compounds and create a new viable drug development pathway.\n We also expanded our partnership with Google Cloud. We'll adopt Gemini for Google Cloud in two ways: first, by training Cognizant associates to use Gemini for software development assistance; and second, by integrating Gemini's advanced capabilities within Cognizant's internal operations and platforms. Using Gemini for Google Cloud, Cognizant's developers will be equipped to write, test and deploy code faster and more effectively with the help of AI-powered tools, improving the reliability and cost efficiency of building and managing client applications.  \n Over the next 12 months, Cognizant expects to up-skill more than 70,000 cross-functional associates on Google Cloud's AI offerings. This is another milestone in our Synapse initiative to up-skill 1 million individuals globally by 2026. Additionally, Cognizant will work to integrate Gemini into its suite of automated platforms and accelerators beginning with the recently announced Cognizant Flowsource platform for developers. \n As a part of our social responsibility platform, we recently announced that since 2018, we have awarded $70 million in philanthropic funds to global skilling programs for underrepresented communities. These 117 grants combined Cognizant's culture of continuous skilling, our focus on prioritization on empowering diversity through technology, and the philosophy that AI and other advanced technologies can be a great equalizer for the future of work. We intend to continue following and participating in the AI innovation cycles by investing in last-mile platform infrastructure, productivity studies and capabilities to enable better and faster integration into enterprise landscapes.  \n In the last 12 months, our AI platforms gained significant traction as we on-boarded clients on the Neuro, Skygrade and Flowsource platforms to cover various phases of AI deployment cycles. By investing in productivity studies, which dissect the anatomy of skills and occupations and map the AI exposure scores to different roles, we have assisted our clients in realizing value and driving the scaled embrace of newer AI use cases. \n As we continue to navigate this ongoing soft demand environment, we remain focused on investing in areas to help our clients reduce total cost of ownership, boost productivity, enhance technology intensity and enable better adoption of new age technologies like AI to capture the current demand and be prepared for the future. And we remain differentiated by investing in industry domain capabilities and platforms in select industries. \n We also believe inorganic opportunities remain an important element of our investment strategy. We continue to seek to expand and deepen capabilities, diversify our business, including into industries where we are underexposed and improve our geographic mix. \n For example, we are pleased with the early traction of our Q1 acquisition of Thirdera, an industry-leading ServiceNow platform, which has significantly expanded our capabilities and credentials. We already see a healthy pipeline of opportunities as direct result of this acquisition to cross-sell within our existing client base.  \n In closing, I want to thank our 345,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our clients and Cognizant. In 2024, we will keep working to increase our revenue growth, become the employer of choice in our industry, and to simplify our operations. Jatin, over to you. Thank you, Bryan. Thank you for that question. This is Ravi here, and let me give it a try, and then I will ask Jatin to add in. The way we look at our guidance range is based on the visibility we get to the middle of the range. And then we look for what's the upside available. The upside available is based on large deal momentum. There is 30 to 40 basis points of M&A, which we are yet to do because this guidance includes 100 basis points of M&A. And the committed spend from many of our clients, sometimes, you can get an upside on it if you ramp up well. So that's the starting point. \n Why did we put this in a broad range? We put it in a broad range -- normally, at this point of time, you would have 200 basis points of range. We have 400 basis points of a range because the market is sluggish. While we are doing well, we've performed well in quarter 1, the market is sluggish, so we kind of kept a broader range. \n How do we see discretionary today? We don't see discretionary changed since we spoke to all of you last quarter. So it remains the same. It hasn't changed. Now let's come to performance of quarter 1. If you've noticed, I mean, the biggest drop in discretionary has been in Financial Services in the past. And that has been for us as well as for the sector and the industry. If you've noticed, the sequential drop from quarter 4 to quarter 1 for us is only $10 million in banking, financial services and insurance. And we are seeing green shoots in BFS, which is 60% of BFSI. \n Health care is doing well. We have managed to continue on our strong portfolio with sequential growth. You've heard about communications, CMT, it's been a phenomenal run for us. We have had year-on-year growth as well as sequential growth that is backed by some large deals we won in the last 12 months. \n This is also a quarter where we have 8 large deals. If you compare that with quarter 1 of last year, it is 4 large deals last year. And these -- out of the 8, 5 were expansion plus renewal, and that gives me a lot of confidence about the fact that we're continuing to expand on large deals. The large deal momentum continues. Of course, there is softness in 0 to $10 million and 0 to $20 million of kind of deals, which are discretionary in [ India ]. So that's broadly how I shape it. \n And if I have to add manufacturing and products, that is pretty stable. So this is how I see how we got to the guidance range. This is how we performed in quarter 1. We have also seen expansion of our deals outside of Americas to Asia Pacific. We have 2 deals out of the 8, which have actually come from Asia Pacific. You've already seen the announcement we did with Telstra, which is a part of our release. Jatin, anything else? I would say the only thing I would add to what Jatin said is SG&A also has leverage with growth. So if growth comes back, you will see leverage on SG&A. Tien-Tsin, thank you so much for that question. We continue to see good large deals momentum through the whole of 2023. I mean, whatever we did in 2023 is helping us on ramp-ups this year, and we'll continue to build that for the rest of the year. This has been a good quarter. In fact, if you just see the announcements we made with clients as a part of our earnings release, you would notice that the number of announcements have also gone up. So I'm very pleased with the progress. I'm also pleased with the fact that we have now started to expand that into Europe and Asia Pacific. \n The softer nature of smaller deals between 0 to $10 million and, I would say, 0 to $15 million or $20 million, that hasn't changed much since we spoke last. And it's hard to predict how that's going to look like for the rest of the year. I do see some improvements, some green shoots in it, and that is reflected in our Financial Services BFSI results, but we should -- we are continuing to watch that area very keenly. \n Essentially, most of the large deals are on cost takeout, vendor consolidation, productivity, efficiency kind of deals. And we are very, very excited about the fact that, that momentum is going to continue for us. Those are deals the market offers, and we are -- we seem to be winning well on that. Of course, the period -- because these large deals are cost-takeout deals, the period of -- the duration of those deals is longer, so you will see realization of revenues over a period of time. \n But it is also sticky, and it gives you an opportunity to create better fulfillment through managed services. So one of the other things we are tracking internally is annual contract value in addition to the total contract value, so that we start to know how much is it contributing to this year. What will be exciting for us is we now have a runway from 2023 into 2024. And going into 2025, we'll have a runway from 2024. Yes. So let me start and get Jatin to add. Discretionary has to be earned every year, so the discretionary doesn't come back. You could call it as structural leakage, if I may, but it isn't as much. It's not like somebody else is taking that away. So discretionary is always the unknown part, if I may. On the -- when I started the year in 2023, we had leakages because when there was a consolidation, somebody else was winning it and not us. That isn't happening anymore. I mean we are very stable with our clients. Our clients are continuing to invest in customers. There's no company-specific challenges, which have led to leakage or there is a potential of leakage. We see that as a very stable platform. \n In fact, my Net Promoter Scores with the clients is continuing to scale up every quarter since 2023. Our attrition rates have fallen significantly, the 10 percentage points we have dropped Y-o-Y this quarter. That's an important part of what clients trust, providers like us. So there is no structural leakage, if I may. \n The discretionary, which is -- the behavior of discretionary spend leads to it not coming back sometimes, coming back in shorter spurts, coming back in a delayed way. Those are the ones you would be watchful about. So that's broadly how I see it. I mean most of the managed services deals, we are winning, both with existing clients, new business as well, some which are proactively bid. We are on the winning side. We are mostly on the winning side in the last, I would say, 15 months or so. Thank you, Jason. The 450 -- let me start with the first one. The 450-odd client engagements, we've come a long way. If you remember, in quarter 2, 2023, we spoke about 100, and now we have 400 early client engagements. And these are very short prototype, rapid prototype kind of deals. 500 of them -- more than 500 of them, we have in the pipeline, and the thing to watch for now is how many of these will go into scaled execution for our clients. And that's where the monetize-able opportunities are. So we are continuing to work on it. \n There are broadly 2 things we are investing on -- or rather, three: first, follow the innovation cycles of AI; second, build the last-mile infrastructure so that the raw power of AI can be made production grade, enterprise grade for our clients. That means last-mile infrastructure related to managing AI platforms, orchestration. In case of AI and like other discontinuities, how do you improve the accuracy of the models? How do you create explainability because this is a black box? How do you create explainability? How do you create observability? So all of those platforms we have built and we have announced is the last-mile infrastructure I kind of referred to, which helps us to take the drop over and make it production grade. \n The second thing we're investing on is productivity studies. I mean, what does AI do to different roles and different operations of different industries? And how do we make embrace of AI much faster on larger cohorts? And we partnered with Oxford Economics and we created templates for every industry, every role, so that we can do an anatomy of tasks, as I call it. And then we then start to figure out how to create a much faster and a much broader embrace in enterprises. So this is preparing for the future where we believe enterprises are going to be a people-plus-machine endeavor. \n Now what does it do to our operating model? Our tech for tech, as I call it. It, of course, changes the productivity of a developer. When the cloud came into picture a couple of years ago, it flipped the productivity where, as a developer, you spend very little time on the plumbing, but you spend a lot of time on innovation. You spend a lot of time on building. This is our second shot at improving developer productivity and not actually spending time on repetitive tasks, not actually spending time on things which a machine can write, but you could actually pivot the developer productivity on innovation. So this is the second shot at it. And I would believe this is probably more disruptive than what the cloud did. And we think what will happen is this will lead to reducing backlog, improving the throughput to our clients, increasing the tech intensity at a lower cost. \n So I always believe that this is going to be an opportunity than a threat if we can pivot ourselves well. And the opportunity is about creating the tech intensity. Every industry doesn't have that intensity, so we have this unique opportunity to create that intensity at a lower cost and a lower entry barrier. I mean you don't need to be a developer to embrace software code, which means the entry barrier goes down. So we think we have a bigger opportunity than before as long as we can embrace this into our own landscape and equally build the use cases for our clients to embrace it. So I see this as a uniquely big opportunity for companies like Cognizant. Yes, I mean the visibility we have so far on the deals we have won, we have baked it into our guidance range. But Jason, you know this, the deals we won last year have a better throughput this year. And the deals we win this year will have a better throughput in the second half of this year and in 2025. The challenge in 2023 was we did have that backlog as we got into 2023 because we were not playing on large deals. Right now, I don't have that challenge because I had a good, healthy pipeline in 2023 that's contributing to 2024. And then we keep doing this in the same sustained manner, we will exit into 2025 with tail velocity. So the first year is normally lower than the second year. And by the end of the second year, you get to the run rate you have to. Normally, the span of the deals has changed. Earlier, it used to be lower. Now, it's 3.5 years or plus because large deals now come on a cost-takeout model, unlike transformation related to -- unlike transformation-related large deals. \n But once we start to execute and get the bid versus bid in a good shape, then the committed spend will then flip over to new spend because you're already in the groove. So that's what we are betting on as well. I mean, once you start to perform well, you have the license to take more from our clients. Yes. So discretionary is small projects. Normally, in smaller projects, you have a different kind of a pyramid versus large deals, where you have a much healthy pyramid, if I may. So with discretionary -- normally, when discretionary comes in, you hire more lateral hires with experience. And when you deal with managed services deals, you hire the pyramid because the pyramid rightly fits in there. So that's probably how it is. \n If you've noticed, we improved utilization from quarter 4 to quarter 1. So that gave us the extra runway, and we'll continue to sharpen our utilization. So that gives us the continued extra runway to grow and keep the engine agile enough to hire the senior people you need and rotate the people from existing teams into newer projects as that happens. So I think we have that agility now on our fulfillment engines. \n I'm very pleased not just about the -- how we have tackled the demand environment. We're very pleased with what we have done on utilization and what we have done on fulfillment of deals we have won as well as getting prepared for the discretionary spend whenever it eventually comes back. So the engine is as agile enough for the current demand situation as well as if there is a spike in the demand. We think we are well placed to seize those opportunities. Moshe, good to hear from you. So we do have that visibility. We have not published that externally. What we track is multiple things. We track the total contract value, the size of the deals, the duration of the deals, how much of that translates to ACV for this year and ACV for the next year, so for the first 12 months or the next 12 months. And we also track the pyramid attached to it and the capability set needed. So I pretty much have that information to rely on so that we can get our fulfillment engine intact as well as forecast better. So it is something we have. We have not published that externally, but I'm keeping a constant track on it. \n And in the book-to-bill ratios, Moshe, you know this, it also depends on what are the duration of the deals. I'm sure you asked this question because of that. The duration of the deals, when you take large deals, they go up. When you take small deals, it goes down. So the book-to-bill has a meaningful impact between the 2. So one of the other metrics we are internally tracking is ACV because then that gives us what is the incremental revenue we'll get for the current calendar year. So it's a combination of things you have to put together to get to a point where you know how much is it going to incrementally contribute to growth. So we have had a very healthy new logo program, Moshe. Since I've come on board, we have a specific program for new logos. We also have a program to ramp new logos to, say, a $50 million or $100 million client, an annual spend of $100 million, $50 million client. I mean opening new logos is one thing, but ramping them up to a $50 million account is another thing. So we have put both swim lanes. We're very, very active in our journey. \n We also have a target list now of new logos and geo-based. And we have kind of separated that from the mining engine because the hunting engine has to -- the hunting engine is humming very well. And there's a transition to the mining engine as the annual size of those accounts changes. \n What we have not done is we have not expressed this to our market on how many new logos we are opening, and we have not created that information pack in the external market. But internally, we're very, very pleased with where we are on new logos and how we are ramping it up. Yes. So the context was if you look at the last few quarters of sequential drop in BFS, you would notice that the sequential drop is relatively smaller between quarter 4 and quarter 1. So something has happened in between. So in the last 12 months, we have worked on reorganizing our BFSI vertical. We have energized the teams with some new hires. We have now a exceptionally good list of offerings. I mean, I now have an operating list for banking and financial services or for insurance. We have opened doors on fintech. We have taken AI and created small discretionary spend opportunities for ourselves. Just to give you a sense in insurance, we have quite a few AI projects running. So we have a variety of things happening. \n I'll give you one or 2 examples. In insurance, there is mainframe modernization, which is a important initiative. In P&C insurance, there is digitizing the distribution network, which is primarily agents and platforms. The group benefits and the policy admin platforms are going through a significant change. In banking and financial services, customer service is going through a significant transformation. So we have an offering that -- and it is an offering which is bundled with AI. \n We have fraud detection and prevention, which is an important opportunity. The regional banks are going through massive cost takeout. We have an offering out there. So I think we now have -- I mean, there is a market reality of what is happening in BFSI. And there is the organizational strength to counter that market reality. So we are a stable shop with all the offerings in place with the right teams, and we are climbing up the ladder. We are trying everything we can in a tough market."

            "name": "Jatin Dalal",
            "content": "Thank you, Ravi, and thank you all for joining us.  \n As I enter my sixth month as Cognizant's CFO, I remain deeply impressed by the culture, passion and client centricity across the organization. I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter in what remains a tough economic environment. Revenue exited the high end of our guidance range, supported by our Communications, Media and Technology segments. The sequential growth of our healthcare segment was also heartening. Strong execution on our NextGen program and disciplined cost optimization actions allowed us to deliver a 15.1% adjusted operating margin, representing 50 basis points of expansion year-on-year.  \n Looking ahead, I am focused on several objectives in support of our broader strategic priorities. First, continue to strengthen our partnerships and collaborations across the organization to improve revenue growth. Second, improve our margin profile through our NextGen cost programs and process enhancements, driven in part by leveraging AI tools. Next, continue to invest in our people with a focus on supporting our company-wide employee skilling programs designed to train our employees on the latest technology, including gen AI. And finally, drive disciplined execution with a focus on maximizing value creation from our M&A investments and improving our large deals risk management framework.  \n First quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, representing a decline of 1.1% year-over-year or a decline of 1.2% in constant currency. Year-over-year performance includes approximately 70 basis points of growth from recent acquisitions. On a sequential basis, revenue was flat from the prior quarter. Across global industry segments and geographies, we have seen the uncertain economic outlook and volatile geopolitical environment weigh on our client spending priorities, which has kept their discretionary spend muted. These headwinds are more pronounced in Financial Services, which is more susceptible to higher interest rates. Health Sciences customers are also being impacted by the inflationary environment and industry-specific headwinds.  \n At the same time, clients continue to prioritize spending that can deliver cost savings quickly and continue to fund investments in transformation and innovation. For example, within our Products and Resources segment, we have seen resiliency among utility customers where grid modernization remains a critical priority. This has been further supported by our 2022 acquisitions of Utegration, which helps drive SAP S/4 cloud opportunities with the utilities customers. In addition, we have seen positive trends amongst automotive customers in area like software-defined vehicles and in our Products and Resources segment, where the convergence of IT and operational technology is driving transformation and digitization priorities.  \n Finally, we were pleased with the performance of our Communications, Media and Technology segment, which grew year-over-year, driven by contribution of recently completed acquisitions and wins with the communications and media customers. This has helped offset discretionary spending pressure among our technology customers, which we believe have been impacted by clients focused on reducing costs.  \n Now moving on to margins. Our NextGen optimization program has progressed well in helping us drive structural cost savings and simplification of our operations. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $23 million of costs related to this program. This negatively impacted our GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points. Excluding this impact, adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, which benefited from savings related to our NextGen program and the depreciation of the Indian rupee. Both our GAAP and adjusted tax rate in the quarter were 24.8%. Q1 diluted GAAP EPS was $1.10 and Q1 adjusted EPS was $1.12. \n Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. DSO of 78 days was up 1 day sequentially and increased 5 days year-over-year, primarily driven by our business mix. Free cash flow in Q1 was $16 million and included the impact of previously disclosed $360 million payments made to Indian tax authorities as well as the payout of bonuses that were accrued last year.  As a reminder, the tax payment to the Indian tax authority was required to proceed with the appeals process relating to our 2016 tax matter. The appeal is ongoing and final amounts refunded to Cognizant or due to tax authorities will be determined at the end of the process. \n We also returned $284 million to shareholders, including $133 million through share repurchases and $151 million through our regular remit. In addition, we completed our acquisition of Thirdera in January for a total consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $420 million. These factors drove quarter end cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion or net cash of $1.6 billion.  \n In 2024, we continue to expect to return over $1 billion to our shareholders, including at least $400 million through share repurchases and $600 million through regular dividends. We will also continue to evaluate inorganic strategic investment opportunities to help accelerate our growth profile, expand our capabilities and diversify our portfolio. \n Now let me speak about the forward outlook. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be flat to growth of 1.5% sequentially, in constant currency.  Year-over-year, this implies a decline of 2.5% to a decline of 1% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to a revenue of $4.75 billion to $4.82 billion, representing a year-over-year decline of 2.9% to a decline of 1.4%. \n For the full year, we continue to expect a revenue decline of 2% to a growth of 2% in constant currency. On a reported basis, this translates to revenue in range of $18.9 billion to $19.7 billion and a decline of 2.2% to a growth of 1.8%, reflecting our latest exchange assumptions. The guidance we are providing as of today assumes up to 100 basis points of inorganic contribution. We see an active pipeline of acquisition opportunities, and we continue to evaluate assets for the right capabilities to support our strategic priorities. Our NextGen program remains on track, and there are no changes to our assumptions regarding the program. We still intend to reinvest the majority of NextGen savings in our growth opportunities in 2024 and beyond.  \n Moving on to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with our Q1 performance and we continue to expect the full year to be in the range of 15.3% to 15.5%. For Q2, we expect adjusted operating margin will be in a narrow range around Q1's number, with NextGen cost savings and improved utilization being offset by initial negative impact from the ramp of large deals and the revenue mix. I am pleased with our sequential improvement in utilization during the quarter, and we are sharply focused on driving further improvements to support margins next quarter.  \n For the full year, we anticipate net interest income of approximately $60 million, which compares to $40 million previously, primarily reflecting updated interest rate and cash balances assumptions. Our adjusted tax rate guidance of 24% to 25% remains unchanged. Our full year free cash flow guidance is also unchanged, and we continue to expect it will represent 80% of our net income. This includes the previously discussed negative impact of $360 million payment made with Indian tax authorities in relation to our ongoing appeal of our 2016 tax matter.\n Our guidance for shares outstanding is unchanged at approximately 497 million. This leads to our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.50 to $4.68, unchanged from our previous guidance. With that, we'll open the call for your questions. Yes. No, Bryan, we are good. If you have any follow-up, we can take it. There will be puts and takes every quarter, as you very well know. But directionally, SG&A should continue to show a right momentum around improvement, but not so much because we have taken a large action in '23. So you would see the [ back ] end of our NextGen program acting through the SG&A line during the course of the rest of the year, but it won't be as large an impact or a big number compared to 2023. That's the view on SG&A. Yes. Bryan, thanks for your question. This is Jatin. Fundamentally, the current environment is that of consolidation of spend, of cost management, improvement in the productivity and so on and so forth. So this is the characteristics of the deals that we are seeing in the market. By design, these deals come with an expectation of superior pricing than what is the pricing which is inherent in the current work. So yes, there is a downward pressure on pricing, but it is nothing out of ordinary that one would expect in the current demand environment. We are not seeing out-of-ordinary behavior in the market as we compete. And I think it's a fair play from that expectation standpoint. Sure. So overall, the reason for large -- a larger range is as follows. I mean, as Ravi mentioned, we start with the midpoint and we look at what is the expected outcome that one can get to. Then we see the range of possibilities. Now if you see our own guidance vis-a-vis quarter 1 to quarter 2, there is an improvement in the guidance range that we gave in --  we are giving in quarter 2 versus quarter 1. And that also means that we will grow sequentially in quarter 2. So overall, we are making good progress. But if you see the demand environment remains reasonably tough, no different than what we spoke in the beginning of the year. And hence, there is a sort of uncertainty in the environment that we are factoring in as we look at our own performance as well as we look at the environment, which is surrounding us. \n Now what can help us go towards the higher end of the range are a few things, and one or more of this could help us. One is that there is some improvement in discretionary spend in the later part of the year. The second is, as Ravi mentioned earlier, a lot of times, when we win a large deal, there is a committed business and there is a right to go after sort of business, which is not committed. But if you fulfill well, if your delivery is good, you can naturally go after that upside to the committed business. That's second. \n The third is we spoke about the inorganic component of our guidance. We have maybe 30 to 40 basis points of potential to execute on. And that could mean in the second half, that could get added to the performance because we have done only one acquisition since the beginning of the year. And fourth is sometimes, a re-batch kind of deal, which comes with a large volume of revenue getting ramped up at a relatively faster pace than the normal ramp-up that you see in a deal. So one or more of this could be at play. \n Right now, we have remained sort of true to our original guidance. We will narrow the range when we meet you next time. But right now, considering all of this, sitting where we are in the year, we thought we'll keep the range same as it was in the beginning of the year. Yes. And if I just add a perspective of the deals that we have won in last, let's say, 18 months. Typically, you would see that compared to what you expected at the time when you won the deal, typically, you will go sometimes faster because you are fulfilling better, you are executing better than what you initially thought and customer thought. And sometimes, it would be slower because there are more change management issues they need to deal with, et cetera. So I think we are evenly placed regarding the pace versus expectation. I don't see anything out of ordinary. There will always be one of the deals that is taking a little longer time to ramp up because there is some change in the client organization, but nothing that is out of ordinary on a win versus execution of the deal. Yes, sure. So if you do that mathematically, I'm sure you already looked at those numbers, and those numbers really mean a very flattish performance for rest of the year and a negative performance that typically happens in quarter 4, given the furloughs. So that's the sort of trajectory we are looking at if markets really tanked and our performance didn't show any positive progress. I'm -- I don't have the math in front of me, but yes, I mean, qualitatively, I would agree with you that we'll have to have a strong quarter 3 and a flattish quarter 4 for us to get to the -- towards the higher range -- higher end of our range, for sure. Yes. Sorry, Jamie. I just add to what I just said before. It's -- I want to go back to what I said in response to an earlier question saying, our expected likely outcome is what we see at the midpoint of the guidance. And then we see the range of possibility on the both ends. And when you specifically asked, I was reacting to the range of possibility on the upper end. I mean, I just want to reflect accordingly so that I respond to you in its completeness."
