At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. \nBrad Delco: Thanks, Catherine, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.

Now I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, our Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, our President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, our President of Highway Services. At this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad. Well, 2020, we will bid you farewell and good riddance. All kidding aside, we are thankful to enter 2021 to start a new chapter and to continue our intended journey. 2020 taught us many lessons, not the least of which is that we have a community of employees, drivers and providers that are more than capable of dealing with change in crisis. The past year also revealed the essential nature of the services we provide as we experienced challenging and dynamic but ever-present demand through 2020. We affirmed again that all of the businesses we have committed to and invest again complement each other and create a very differentiated model for our customers. We look ahead to 2021 and beyond with confidence. During the fourth quarter, we experienced some very traditional demand cycles from customers across all services consistent with holiday activities. These needs were coupled with unusual inventory restocking and import challenges, particularly on the West Coast. Our fleet in the highway and contract businesses presented reliable capacity, held up well, and we discovered new ways to integrate our assets across customers and accounts.\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John, and good afternoon to those joining us on the call. Comments on the fourth -- sorry, David. Can you hear me now? Okay. Sorry about that. Thank you, John. And good morning -- or excuse me, good afternoon to those of us -- of you joining us on the call today. I had a little technical difficulty there. I'll provide a couple of comments on the fourth quarter from a consolidated perspective and then let the business units cover their segments. Overall, we are pleased with the revenue growth this quarter with notable achievements in the Highway division as well as dedicated. Cost pressures in the fourth quarter were primarily related to higher costs across network and operations due to congestion and labor tightness from increased freight demand, higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers in a capacity-constrained environment, and we also incurred higher group medical costs in the quarter. A quick update on COVID costs. We continue to offer paid time off to our employees that are quarantined due to COVID concerns, and we incurred approximately $5 million of costs in the quarter designated as specific to COVID for a total of approximately $34 million year-to-date. While I believe our facility work is complete, we expect COVID PTO costs to continue given the current level of case counts and will likely be a headwind for us over the near term. We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and changing credit landscape as we enter the new year but are encouraged as we experienced what I would consider to be somewhat of a normal fourth quarter with respect to customer collections. We resumed stock buybacks early in the fourth quarter but found less opportunity in the back half of the quarter and then fell into our blackout period. We anticipate continuing our normal buyback approach in 2021.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B. Hunt's investment in innovative culture continue to drive our ability to help us solve for our customers' supply chain needs. It is with little doubt that 2020 was one of the most challenging and dynamic freight markets in my career. The pandemic created a tremendous amount of uncertainty that was felt across the global supply chain. The massive shift from a services to a good economy and the inability for supply chains to keep up with demand have put inventory levels in a precarious position that will take time to rebuild. Import levels have and continued to surge, and congestion and dwell time ports, rail terminals and customer warehouses is also contributing to the inefficient use of available capacity. Combined with the challenges that this pandemic has had directly on our industry heroes are drivers. The supply of qualified and trained driving professionals have been impacted by capacity limitations at driving schools, quarantine protocols, retirements, in addition to pressure as a result of escalating insurance costs in the recent drug and alcohol clearing house. Unfortunately, these challenges have put inflationary cost pressures on our and many businesses and, as the market is anticipating, will put further inflationary pressure on transportation rates in 2021.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile and also shed some light on our pipeline and some high-level views on our outlook. First, on Dedicated results. Dedicated had another solid quarter that delivered the highest fourth quarter revenue and operating income for our segment in our history. And we have previously discussed the benefits of our diversified customer base and the flexibility of our operations have allowed us to serve with customers who needed while scaling back with customers who have been negatively impacted by the current state of the economy. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solution continues to build as customers and potential customers are faced with rising insurance costs, greater challenges recruiting and retaining a professional driving workforce, and the realization of the capital tied up in their own fleet does not provide them the flexibility that we have been able to deliver for our customers. We ended 2020 selling 1,331 trucks in DCS, which compares to 890 trucks sold year-to-date through the end of September quarter. As you can see in our fourth quarter stats, we added 192 trucks sequentially, which did impact the quarter in terms of start-up costs, and we would expect some pages of fleet growth and start-up costs returning to the business for the near to midterm. Also, we expect the industry has and will continue to face driver wage, pressure and we will be keeping a close eye on it. We monitor the performance of our fleet and believe we have some of the best wages and professional drivers in the industry who enjoy the consistency of working in a dedicated environment. Finally, we do expect to return to the previously stated range of selling 800 to 1,000 trucks a year. On Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to deliver an all-time record revenue of $223 -- or $213 million or 17% greater than the previous record set last quarter. This growth was driven primarily by new contracted business throughout 2020 and supplemented by acquisitions. In fact, we track our contracted sales progress very similar to DCS, and I was proud of the team's performance in selling $84 million of new business and Final Mile throughout 2020. We are continuing to see strength and robust opportunities for growth across our portfolio and are excited about further building out our exercise equipment channel with the most recent acquisition of mass movement. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in our service and product offering to ensure the highest standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical and rapidly growing part of the supply chain. We believe these investments are critical as we deliver goods inside the home of our customers' customers. As a result of these investments and our desire to provide a differentiated service product, we'll be focusing on appropriate returns in our business to support these investments. Also, while still early in the new role as COO, I thought I would share some high-level thoughts on how I think we can leverage our platform to manage our assets more efficiently across the enterprise. If I learned one thing in DCS over the years, it's the benefit of having density in markets and what flexibility that provides our customers and our own operations. I see tremendous opportunity for us to leverage the platform, to drive greater efficiencies across all assets across the enterprise and look forward to providing future updates in the near future. That concludes my remarks, and so I'll turn it over to Darren now.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick. Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. This afternoon, my comments will focus on network fluidity in balance, the demand pricing environment, and then I want to talk about 2021 and our focus for this year. First, our volumes were minus 2% in October, flat in November and plus 6% in December. Rail provider velocity challenges and terminal congestion weighed heavy on our container fleet productivity during the quarter. While we weren't able to move all the volume available to us, we were able to accomplish one of our top priorities that we have communicated since the start of the pandemic, and that is honoring our capacity commitments to our customers. Throughout the quarter, we utilized a much higher percentage of the outsourced dredge capacity in an effort to drive productivity through the network. This included efforts to pull containers from the rail terminals to assist in the congestion challenges. We also rerouted significant volume over Phoenix, Arizona and Stockton, California that would have normally moved from a Southern California origin rail terminal. These higher costs of the drayage operation are reflected in the results of the quarter. Our customers participated with incremental revenue to help cover those costs, but that revenue fell short of providing the same margin as what we would have seen without that activity. We have commented on the labor challenges we are all facing during the pandemic on the previous earnings calls. California was particularly difficult during the quarter. We certainly believe the rail network faced some labor challenges at terminals and at locations where we believe our rail providers expect and will deliver better productivity in the future, certainly better than what we experienced in the quarter. I make these comments primarily to highlight that we faced conditions in the fourth quarter that we can address and improve as we move out of the pandemic. So far in January, volume demand remains extremely strong, and the cost to serve our customers remains elevated. Rail velocity and congestion has improved for now, but labor challenges and increased demand will continue to impact rail velocity as the year goes on. We fully expect pricing in this bid cycle will cover the cost increases that we are experiencing that are more structural in nature in our network. We believe 2021 will present opportunities for us to make progress on the margin front. Costs on all fronts, dray, rail and productivity have all come at us at a fast pace in 2020, and this New Year presents our opportunity to price those costs into our business. We must find growth opportunities that complement our network and provide balanced benefits while also increasing core pricing that reflects the current cost to serve our market. The very early and small percentage of pricing results achieved, thus far are encouraging. We are confident that our customers want to grow with us at prices that support investment in capacity expansion. We have ordered over 6,000 containers that will be manufactured in 2021, and we have flexibility on how and when those containers will be rolled out. We have strong confidence in the ability of our network to consume growth, particularly in the East. We also recognize that we still have significant cost and velocity challenges in Southern California, and simply adding containers is not the only solution required to grow capacity in that key market. BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working together to find better capacity solutions for our customers, and our prices will reflect those efforts. Importantly, as we progress through bid season, we do have opportunities to increase our container order if market dynamics support the need for additional capacity. Throughout 2020, our employees have been the backbone of our conviction to honor the commitments we made to our customers. I am so thankful to our employee base for that conviction, and I believe we will translate that culture into benefits for our financial performance and our returns in 2021. That completes my prepared comments, so now I will turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'd like to share how honored I am to be in this new role and just how much excitement there is in the organization for our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and trucks. My comments this afternoon will focus on the performance of both segments and, as Shelly alluded, how we were able to solve for yes in a very dynamic environment for our customers and deliver the capacity of it in the quarter. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $587 million or 56% growth over the prior year, which was also 36% growth sequentially from the third quarter. As previous calls have referenced, our investments in technology and people have been around enabling us to scale the business, and we were able to see a lens of this dynamic play out in the quarter. As we talked about scaling the business, our focus has been on being able to grow revenue and gross profit at a disproportionate rate to operating costs. We were able to deliver $31 million of sequential gross profit improvement and a corresponding $24 million increase in operating income, which translates into a 77% incremental margin on every dollar of gross profit. Speaking of which, ICS did deliver positive $5.6 million of operating income in the quarter. And while we have shared our expectations for returning to profitability by second half of '21, we are going to stand by that view as there were just a lot of unique dynamics in play in the fourth quarter, and we expect some seasonal effects plus continued investment to keep us on track for delivering on that expectation. In JBT or truck, the segment was able to deliver 50% growth in fourth quarter revenue year-over-year to $140 million. This is the highest achieved -- excuse me, this is the highest revenue achieved in the segment since the third quarter of '08, as Shelley had mentioned in her opening remarks, and we have approximately 70% fewer company-owned trucks versus that time period. As you're beginning to see, the power of the platform allows both ICS and JBT to scale with and for our customers to solve for their needs. And in the fourth quarter, that need was capacity. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by the J.B. Hunt owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360 offering. This gives us greater options to choose what is best for the customer who is looking for a drop and hook capacity solution. And by best, I mean the most efficient option that eliminates waste in the system. To close out my comments, I would just like to reiterate how Highway Services powered by the platform was able to meet the needs of our customers in the quarter by delivering flexible capacity options. We continue to see strong activity between customers and capacity in our platform, which will continue to support investments into our Highway Services solutions whether it's in the marketplace or within the 360 program. I'd like to turn it back over to Brad Delco.\nBrad Delco: Thanks Brad. And Catherine, at this point, we're ready for questions. I just like to remind the audience, please given the length of the folks in the queue, one question one follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator:  And your first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citibank.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe I can start on John's sort of opening comments around Intermodal margins. I was just wondering if you could kind of give a little bit more color. It sounds like '21 is a year where you have the opportunity to see some margin expansion. I guess I'm curious around the timing of your comments about sort of maybe questioning whether the 11% to 13% is the right number going forward. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the thought process? And what you need to see to sort of make a decision on that?\nDarren Field: So Chris, this is Darren. I'm going to start with that. I think when John highlighted those comments we just know that the performance of our Intermodal margin over several years now would be a question on the call. And rather than try to talk through exactly when in 2021, exactly at what time would we have a public release with some change, we just wanted to highlight, hey, we do agree that 2021 is a year that we need to make progress. We fully need to -- in the pricing market and what's going on around us feels like it's the right time to talk about that. The other thing that I think John highlighted is that the margin comments relative to Intermodal aren't alone, and he was highlighting commentary about the enterprise and other business units. And that's why I think John wanted to talk about that.\nShelley Simpson: And Chris, I might note that even if you look at the last five years, we have three years of unusual activity between our relationship with the railroads and also a pandemic. So we do believe 2021 will be a more settled year when it comes to our margin targets. And certainly, that's why we have split up our conversation around new equipment on behalf of our customers. We want to put the initial order in, and then we're going to work through with each customer through the bid process to determine if the returns will be appropriate for us to get inside that range.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then maybe a follow-up, speaking on Intermodal, can you talk a little bit about what the rate negotiations are looking like through the fourth quarter in terms of magnitude for '21? Any color you can give about what you think you might be able to achieve from a rate growth perspective in Intermodal would be helpful?\nJohn Kuhlow: Sure. I think on the third quarter call, I think I said high single digits to double digits. And I would say that still remains to be a pretty good placeholder for pricing in general for our network. There are certainly key markets where it's substantially higher or it's absolutely in the double-digit area. West Coast capacity costs is a different challenge for us, frankly, than elements of, say, our Eastern network and what's going on there. When I look at the network and think about how will pricing translate in the bid cycle, a lot still has to be seen. We did say high single to low double digits. And I think that, that remains to be a pretty good placeholder. But certainly, there are pockets of our network where I think it will be higher than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Darren, it seems like there's going to be very little reprieve in the next couple of weeks and months. The typical Chinese year -- Chinese New Year slowdown post-peak season just based on ship schedules and activity, it seems like the port is going to be running hard the next couple of months. What's your confidence level in the rail's ability to continue to improve this imbalance in fluidity to actually see a significant change in your ability to meet the volumes that are out there in the first quarter and into the second quarter without any type of February slowdown?\nDarren Field: Yes. Well, I think, look, I'm confident in the way we communicate with our rail provider out West. We are aligned in efforts to try to drive capacity out there. I'm also confident in the way our organization on our enterprise solves for capacity challenges. I do think that, obviously, there may be a little reprieve in the parcel demand and some other impacts on the rail network. And the full truckload Intermodal seems to have some momentum in terms of our ability to drive capacity out West. So I think we'll have a better position going forward in the first quarter than we felt in the early part of the fourth quarter around moving empties out West. That doesn't mean that we'll be moving as many as the customers would like for us to move. So congestion and velocity slowdown has been a challenge, but I think the fourth -- the first quarter of '21 does present the potential for better velocity than what we experienced in Q4.\nJon Chappell: And then just as a direct follow-up to that, you'd mentioned kind of briefly the opportunity in the East Coast. Are you seeing significant freight shift to the East Coast, just given the challenges in the West Coast? And is the congestion in the imbalances in the eastern part of your network similar to what's been going on in the West Coast?\nDarren Field: So there was meaningful opportunity for us in the Eastern network during the fourth quarter that we had to delay implementing Intermodally. We serve those customers with our highway solutions, but we were delaying implementing some new business in the East during the fourth quarter while our equipment was consumed in serving some customers on the West Coast. As we go through the first quarter, we have already experienced growth in the East Coast and feel confident that, that will continue to be available to us. That growth is not tied to customers rerouting to different imports. That's highway conversion of business that has been available for us for some time now through the back half of last year. We are aware of some customers that are talking about altering their import strategy. We'll continue to look at what their plans are, and we'll provide solutions as those opportunities present themselves. We certainly believe the Eastern network moves more fluidly than what we had experienced in the West, certainly in the fourth quarter, but we fully expect the whole network to see gradual improvements as '21 continues.\nShelley Simpson: I might make a note on that as well, just the growth in the Eastern network. If you look at our sales activity, across the enterprise, we are up year-over-year and it accelerated into the fourth quarter, so our customers asking us to solve for their needs in total. And then our benefits of seeing the data in our platform now, we've recognized the number of shipments that actually should or could be moving Intermodal that gives us even more confidence. We saw that number grow substantially throughout the year as well. So the combination of more activity along with what we see in the platform that we actually moved over the highway that should be moving intermodal, those two pieces really help us in our confidence in our plan in the Eastern network.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Maybe just a follow-up for you, Shelly, on that last commentary about where you can see that should be moving on the network. In the past, you said it's around 8 million to 10 million, maybe as high as 11 million loads. Can you just talk about the progress you think you've made in getting some of that conversion? It sounds like you have started to see some in the East. And do you think the service challenges, as they've appeared, is that really delayed or impaired the opportunity you feel there is to convert some of the freight off highway?\nShelley Simpson: Brian, so similar to what Darren talked about, which is the opportunity for us to work across the enterprise, here coming into the fourth quarter, we certainly felt pressure from our customers from unplanned activity but also just the level of demand not matching the available capacity there was in the market, and we did a great job across the Company solving for our customers. And so think more of what do our customers need, and then we applied what was the best answer based on the capacity that we could source at their price and service that the customer really could work with. We still think there is a huge opportunity in intermodal. I go back to what we see in the platform. It is a significant number of shipments that are moving on the highway that really should convert into Intermodal with more fluidity and our ability to really get the network more in motion. But our objective, Brian, is really to own that business. If you look across our entire organization, whether it's one pallet to everything a customer moves, we now can handle that in North America. And so we're trying to solve for our customers, recognizing there are constraints. But certainly, our mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America, the most efficient is to move into Intermodal. And so we are intense working closely with our customers to do just that.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay. Maybe a follow-up on the ICS performance in the quarter, it was clearly a very strong sequentially year-over-year, having a look at it votes per employee were way up and it looks like there's some mixed impact as well. But I think the comments were that you're still sticking with the second half productivity or the profitability trend rather. So maybe you can just bridge the difference between what happened in this quarter, which was quite strong? And what do you think is maybe one-time? Or is going to evolve from here a little bit more seasonally, just that you're going to still kind of hit the same target that you were before after such a strong result?\nJohn Roberts: Yes. Thank you, Brian. The comment was that we would still maintain get into profitability in the second half of this year. And there's no question that with the profits that were generated in the fourth quarter that we anticipated that question. But the reality is that the fourth quarter of '20 really did have some pretty abnormal things that drove incremental volume our way. As Shelly just mentioned, our ability to say yes and find that answer for our customers. But each and every one of them are now reevaluating what their network and what their makeup of carrier mix is going to be for 2021. So we still have work to do on our tech investments that will be somewhat of a drag for us in the first half as we close out the investment component And so as we think about that, there's just a little bit of unusual in this in Q4 that makes it very hard to predict as we move into 2021. What I would say is that we are incredibly satisfied with how the platform performs with that rapid growth and that rapid pressure of customer needs. And so it does tell us that we're on the right track, and we have a high confidence level to reiterate our previous expectations. Shelly, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?\nShelley Simpson: I would just say, Brian that I hope that we can convert out of ICS into our more efficient ways to do business inside the organization. That is a huge focus for us. We are working with our customers. We recognize that there were unplanned activities and costs that don't necessarily make for an efficient way to move goods over the long term. Having said that, we are still very focused on taking market share and making sure that we continue to grow. Our customers are on board, and we did gain very favorable marks from our customers throughout the quarter and ending the year with some of our highest ratings from customers. So our ability to solve was excellent. Now we're trying to solve for overall cost for our customers. And I think that's some of the things that Brad is referencing. We want to get some of this business converted into Intermodal. We know the Eastern network is an easy place for us to start. And then we want to continue to work on where the platform can create benefit for our customers so we can start to grow in those new channels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. And congratulations on the strong results in brokerage and ICS. Good to see that move into profitability so far ahead of schedule. A question, I think, is some of the points that I believe John made earlier in the call on considering what the kind of longer-term look would be. You implied that the margin outlook might come down on Intermodal. What about the volume outlook? Is that something -- I know you don't have a formal target, but it's been lower the last couple of years than your history. It seems like you have a great setup for Intermodal volume growth in 2021. But how should we think about just the kind of multiyear Intermodal volume look maybe compared to what we've seen the last couple of years or in the past?\nBrad Delco: Tom, this is Brad Delco. I'll respond to that, and I'll let Darren or anyone else add to it. I mean historically, what our message has been is we think the Intermodal market still has secular growth characteristics. We expect Intermodal volumes to outpace growth of the general transportation industry. And given our scale and our size and our ability to serve and solve for our customers' needs, we expect to be able to grow faster than the Intermodal industry. And so we'll leave it at that. I mean that's our long-term view. I mean clearly, when capacity is constrained in areas, we'll perform-- underperform or overperform. But that's been our message. I just want to make sure that was clear to the audience. And I'll pass it over to Darren to add anything else to that.\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, from a volume perspective, I understand the highlight on the question around particularly looking back on the fourth quarter, there was significantly more volume available to us in the market than what we were able to handle based on velocity challenges that were going on. And we still feel strongly. And Shelley mentioned it we're bringing on customers with Intermodal at the right time when we have capacity available. That doesn't mean that we're taking capacity away from a commitment that we've already made. As we go into '21, we did talk about, we've ordered more containers. We expect pricing to accommodate. Potentially is if velocity as our rail system today is more structurally slower than what it was four or five years ago, then pricing is going to have to contemplate that when we think about investment in those long-term assets. And so that's a big focus for us, but we did highlight that we're buying equipment this year because we're confident in the customers' desire to buy that service. So -- and as Brad mentioned, I mean, we do expect Intermodal volumes to grow at least as strong as the industry. I do think in the back half of last year that was a challenge for us particularly in the network and the weighting where we were relative to capacity demands on the West Coast. And as moving forward, we're going to have to grow where capacity is available. And then look to change operations in the markets where capacity is difficult and how do we drive efficiency out west. And we highlighted that we're engaged in conversations with a rail provider there, and we do believe we can both be more efficient in the coming years out West.\nTom Wadewitz: So that it sounds like you're saying we're not -- you're not reviewing the volume view for Intermodal, but you are reviewing the margin view. What about look at historical...\nDarren Field: No, no. We want to grow -- we're going to grow volume in 2021, and we're going to expand margin. We need to do both, and the market will support both.\nTom Wadewitz: Right. What my follow-up would just be, historically, I think, 100 basis points, maybe 130 is a pretty good margin improvement year for Intermodal. It does seem like there's a stronger formula for Intermodal margin performance in 2021. Do you think you have a chance to do kind of better than historical in terms of margin performance in '21 in the Intermodal segment?\nJohn Roberts: I think it's just too early to say. We'll -- that I'll leave Tom. We don't give that specific of guidance, and so we're going to avoid answering that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Darren, just following up on some of the comments you made in response to Tom's question. You said something about maybe rail pricing, there needs to be some contemplation of that. And so I wanted to ask you, so where do you sit today? I mean, obviously, John, I think in your opening remarks, you're sort of alluding to something more structural going on with rail costs. Does that mean when you think about the bid season in the next few months that the Intermodal rates need to go up significantly more than TL rates? And then the second part of my question, you can count this as my follow-up. In your discussions with the rails, they're all talking about sort of broadly wanting to grow. Is there any willingness on their part to maybe become a little bit more accommodative on rates to sort of drive more traffic onto the network? So if you could share your topic your thoughts on those topics that would be great.\nDarren Field: Sure. I'll answer the last question first. There's not a railroad waiting in line to lower the cost. I'll wait on that phone call for -- no, that's not happening.\nAllison Landry: Didn't think so.\nDarren Field: There are markets where, yes, Intermodal prices probably do need to outpace truckload rates. But there are markets where the Intermodal prices can be at, maybe even below truckload market price changes. So it's a little bit broad to make a statement that Intermodal rates need to outpace truckload rates. I don't think they do. And I don't think they necessarily will throughout our entire network. But there are some key pockets where, yes, I absolutely think they will.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Darren, I got a couple for you. So first on the volume side, what changed in December to allow the volume growth to accelerate? And do you have any perspective you can share? Has that continued so far to start the first quarter? And any thoughts on, how to think about volumes in the first quarter?\nDarren Field: Yes. I think as the quarter went on, there was a small reprieve in our ability to reposition empties out West, and that showed up in December a little bit better than it had earlier in the quarter. Some of it might be related to a weakness in December of 2019, frankly. But certainly, January so far has been what we expected it to be, and that has been -- demand has been strong, and our network is more fluid.\nScott Group: Okay. And then I want to try one more on the margin side. First, I think you just said it, but I just want to make sure I heard it, that you are -- I know you're not giving guidance on margins, but you think Intermodal margins improved this year. And then the other part is the longer-term guidance the -- as you revisit this, is this more a function of the reality of what the margins have done in the last couple of years in the tougher part of the cycle? Or is it more a warning of don't expect the margins to get to that 11% plus range in the good part of the cycle? I mean, we know what the past is. We're trying to think about the forward. Are you trying to suggest to us, hey, we may not get to 11?\nDarren Field: I don't think anybody is trying to get.\nScott Group: Okay, go ahead.\nDarren Field: Okay, Scott, I don't think we're trying to suggest anything other than acknowledge that the Intermodal margin has been a primary topic for our investors for some time. We're coming out of a very turbulent period. Shelley highlighted that, gosh, for three years, we've had charges from arbitration. We're in the middle of a pandemic. We've got driver hiring challenges. The outsourced market is extremely difficult. We honored commitments to our customers. And as we go through 2021, we are hopeful and have the expectation that I'm not going to -- I want to be cautious on using stability. But certainly, a lot of those challenges will fall behind us. The market certainly is ready to support strong price increases, and we'll see what we can do. I think that's been our message is that we'd like a more stable year to evaluate that. And that's really the bulk of what the message was.\nJohn Roberts: Yes. I'll just add, Scott. This is John, that there are a number of items that are -- we hope are behind, like arbitration PSR. The pandemic has been this year and some of the outputs of that are things like -- I was talking to Craig earlier, I know, Nick, you've got some day on this. Driver availability is in a new place today. And so while we're going to go to the market for rates to help deal with changes and evolution in our cost structure to get back to that place we think we should be, by the way. And I hope we're being very clear because I think we have a duty to be clear that we haven't changed our expectations. We believe this year will solidify in a more settled -- I'd like the term, Shelley, settled environment. Now it's not a smooth environment. It's sort of the ongoing current state. Let's look at driver availability, as I was just referencing. Driver schools are under duress, okay? Drivers are retiring, and schools are putting out new drivers. That puts a unique pressure. That's going to be ongoing though. The things around PSR and arbitration, all that; we think, are more settled. So we've got to go to market, and we've got to see if the customer is willing to pay for J.B. Hunt to provide company assets to do dray, to present a large fleet, to have a presence that can serve, that can do things that we've been able to do in the past. They're going to answer that question for us through this year in their decisions around how they award business and outlook rates. If we can't get that answer to get us back to 11% to 13%, then I'm going to make sure we communicate that and all the things that go with it. But we're not there in early indications and conversations we're having with Shelley and the sales team and Darren and his team and all that. We still have optimism that the customer needs what we provide, and it's unique, by the way, And we want to keep providing it, but we need that support, and we need those margins to return to achieve the returns that we've enjoyed in the past. And that's really where we are. I also think it's important to say, it's not just Intermodal margins, which was purely the purpose of that part of my opening remarks that the whole company has to take a really deep breath and look at where we are going to both. We also need to look at where we are dedicated Because as we split that business out, we're saying, hey, we need to look at that business, the returns of the assets required for that business. And we need to make sure we're on steady, again, the term steady footing for what we can present in terms of expectations, not only to you but to our customers as we set price and as we establish contract. Same is true for our truckload business. We're looking at, hey, there's a place here with the growth we experienced in the fourth quarter. And some of the nuances that we're experimenting with around trailers, we might be able to remodel our capital thoughts in Truckload that might be able to be supported by a different margin profile. And I'm just trying to coordinate that conversation as not a one-time event, a one-off. I think the Company has a duty to evaluate its expectations. And this is the year that we're calling out we're going to do that. I think we'll be able to give you progress reports along the way. And I think there'll be a lot of clarity or pay with it.\nShelley Simpson: I might just note, from a customer view, we have a lot of confidence in the orders we placed for both Intermodal and highly services. And you heard Nick talk about the pipeline that he has. So our customers' demand is high. We have confidence that we can get to appropriate returns on that that we have ordered already. And now we just want to make sure we understand, is there more appetite than what we've already set up structurally for 2021? And I will tell you, I think that our customers want more from us than what we are planning right now. But we'll see that through the bid season and be able to establish that. And then to reiterate what Darren said, our margins will improve in Intermodal. That's what we're launching towards. We took care of our customers. We reiterated that through the entire pandemic all through 2020 that we would honor our commitments, and it is very much like what we did in 2017 and 2018. We honored our commitments. We came back to customers in 2018, and our customers matched up with us cost to price. We don't expect to change from that, but we want to walk through our bid season to see if we should take more of a stance on equipment ordering past what we've already committed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Just following up on the long-term OR target in Intermodal, but not to beat the dead horse. But I've always considered that business a very high return on invested capital business. And as we've known with Final Mile, you can have lower margins, but the returns on capital can be very high. And so I was just thinking about, as you guys adjust maybe or possibly adjust the long-term expectation of the book earnings to the book margins of the business, is there anything happening structurally that maybe allows the Intermodal business to retain the ROIC that it has now even though the margins are lower? Or any change in operating ratio expectations will directly correspond to the change in the return on capital of that business?\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Amit, this is Brad. I'll let John or Darren add to what I say. But when you think about it, if revenue or cost per load is going up and you're really focused on just margin percent, which I think in the investment community is very focused on, if revenue per load goes up, and contribution on a dollar basis per unit remains consistent or improves, and the capital required to generate that contribution on a dollar basis stays the same, and you can achieve similar ROIC even though there is degradation in the margin. So I know there is so much focus on margin percent. I think the work that will be done this year -- and that we're going to be transparent and communicate with the investment community is, we're going to look at all of the inputs. And we're going to just make sure that we are, in fact, generating what we deem to be appropriate returns on our investment. And we'll update what that margin output is based upon the analysis. So that's my comment, Darren or John, if you want to add anything more to that?\nDarren Field: Well, I mean, we've said for many years now that we care first about our return profile. And really, Brad, I think you highlighted it. That's our measuring stick. And that's how we're going to think about have we been successful in our approach to managing the investments in our assets, are we presenting a strong enough return. And I'm quite certain that, that's what John holds me accountable to do is to find improvements in the way that our return profile is. So that's our focus in '21.\nJohn Roberts: And one of the comments I made earlier, we want to provide our customers with the services we currently present and -- but we expect and demand a proper return on that investment. If the customer says, hey, I don't -- I can't support that. And we've actually seen that a little bit. You mentioned final model, there was a period where we were only company assets, and the expense related to that and the margins required for that service were not supported in the market. So we've taken off of that offering. And today, we've seen a great growth path and being able to offer a different capital profile that can run at different margins and still present the kind of returns that we expect as Darren said. That's been our North Star for a very long time, and it serves us well, and we aren't about to abandon it. So if we get back results from this bid work, it says, hey, we can't achieve that 11 13. Okay, then what do we do next? How do we look at our fleet profile and consider different approaches to how we offer that service? That would end up in even at lower margins, similar to better return performance. And that's how we're going to do it.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. I think that's the point, right? Like, you're going to measure the quality of the business, ROIC is the right measure, and the OR is not really -- it can bifurcate from ROIC depending on what you've talked about. So that's a good point, yes. The follow-up, if I could. I know we're coming to the -- we're past time here. But Darren, I wanted to ask how congestion is impacting the Intermodal business vis-\u00e0-vis volume and cost? And the only reason I ask this question is because if I look at box turns, at least the way we look at it, it's not much lower than where it was pre-COVID or all this since you fire all this congestion? And I know you're adding more trailers this year, which will help with growth. But if you can just address how box turns are still holding up so well when there's significant congestion in rail service because I would have imagined that, that's where I would have seen it, and if you could just talk about that?\nDarren Field: Well, I think in the period of time pre-COVID, you saw box turns that were similar to what they are in COVID, but we had significant amounts of capacity in storage that had been bought at periods of time when velocity was challenged and congestion existed in periods leading up to 2019.We have grown our fleet to deal with a little bit weaker terms and pricing was -- returns were supporting that. As we came into 2020, terms were not built around the size of our fleet, and our volume was not yet where we had anticipated it would be based on how large our fleet was. So we were anticipating velocity and improvements in 2020, and we were experiencing that right up until the pandemic. So really, starting in June, demand went off the charts, and everything slowed down a bit. And so yes, you're not seeing any kind of significant change in trends. And that's relevant to how bad congestion has impacted the amount of time it takes a container to travel on Intermodal loads today is longer than it was a year ago. And we would expect for that to improve this year -- or I should say it was longer in Q4. We should expect that, that transit will either improve this year or the pricing will reflect that we have to own the asset for a longer amount of time in order to accommodate the load for the customer. And that's how we're going to view it. But I do expect congestion and velocity in our system to gradually improve in '21.\nAmit Mehrotra: So what you're implying them this year is a more balanced between loads and yield then, right? Because if your box turns improve, then maybe volumes improved commensurately and you get a more balanced dynamic in yield and volume?\nDarren Field: Well, I think our lean this year is actually more to price than it is anything else. We've got to expand our margins, but we are confident in our ability with the equipment acquisitions that we're making in order to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Maybe to follow up on that, that last question around rail service and velocity issues. Darren, is there a way to think about the magnitude of the margin impact we've seen in the back half of 2020, so Intermodal margins have been around 9%? If service were to get back to pre-pandemic levels, where would that margin shake out? I'm just curious if that's tens of basis points, if it's 100 basis points. Is there any help you can provide on that front?\nDarren Field: I probably can't get too specific there, Justin. I just know this, that when you look at the fourth quarter, the amount of outsourcing we did was significant on the drayage front. We had employees of our own in quarantine. I think John Kuhlow mentioned how much the Company had spent on PTO related to COVID time for our employees. Yet, we're replacing the capacity that, that employee was going to present by going to the open market and bringing outsourced costs that were significantly elevated in 2020. And so that's some of the major drivers of margin challenges in the fourth quarter. Service and velocity is a component of it. But really in the back half of last year, and particularly in the fourth quarter, drayage cost increases as we had to go to the outsourced market were significant.\nJustin Long: Okay. And as my follow-up, I just wanted to ask if there was any update to the quarterly cadence of the repricing you expect in both Intermodal and the contractual business in ICS. Can you just help us with where we sit today in terms of what's been repriced and how the remainder of bid season should progress on a percentage basis?\nShelley Simpson: Sure. So for the most part, the Company follows similar trends. Intermodal is a little bit different on how much has been priced so far. But if you just look at -- typically, we start a bid season in Q4, and that's kind of what we deem as the start about 10% of our business or so starts in that time period, particularly in Intermodal as who is putting their bids out is more impacted in our Intermodal segment. But as you move forward, we've priced about 35% of our business between 35% and 40% of our business. Of that, somewhere in the mid-teens has been awarded and very little has implemented. A little more in Intermodal has already implemented. If you just want to look at Intermodal, think of it like this Q1, around 20%; Q2, around 35%; Q3, around 30%; and Q4, around 10%. It's in that range, depending on when customers come out with our actual bids. Sometimes, that changes, but that's about the right timing.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. And those are all numbers. Those percentages are when implemented, correct?\nShelley Simpson: Correct. Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Shelley or Brad, Darren mentioned earlier on Intermodal that January is expected in a fluid network, and we saw the spot market up and ICS 104% in the spot loads. It seems like we're going to see working through the Chinese New Year at the ports and low inventories. Can you kind of talk about how you see demand trending into early '21 and maybe overall segment thoughts?\nShelley Simpson: Yes. So from our customers' view, inventory is still an issue. And we do see the labor challenges, particularly coming inbound on the import side. I would say it's been a little bit slower than anticipated here for the last 7 to 10 days. But the forecast really puts us back in line, particularly when you look at what's happening from an import in total volume. We do think that our customers will continue to restock all the way through the first half of the year. And I'm not sure how much of a slowdown we're actually going to see from Chinese New Year, considering that there is a backlog of containers that are trying to come into the port and trying to turn and get out to be deployed. I think that, that will move forward as we come into what would typically be a lull. We do think the West Coast will be tighter than usual from a seasonality perspective, and that will push forward into the rest of what's happening in the truckload market. I would say spot price in general has fallen over the last 7 to 10 days matching what we've seen from a demand perspective, but I don't think anything is out of the norm and still anticipate a stronger-than-normal first half.\nKen Hoexter: Just to clarify, what was the little slower in the last seven days? Was that any particular business or just traffic overall?\nShelley Simpson: I would say just across the board, our customers trying to get throughput from an import perspective.\nKen Hoexter: Got it. And then in Dedicated, Nick, you mentioned the margins now in the mid-teens. You noted 800 to 1,000 new trucks. Is that business that you've -- you're confident you sold and committed? Is that at new rates? Maybe you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on going forward on Dedicated.\nNick Hobbs: Yes. That is business that, based on our pipeline -- our pipeline in January, both in Dedicated and Final Mile is stronger than our pipeline January of last year. So we feel very good about our pipeline and those numbers. So not signed deals yet, but it's based on how our pipeline flows, we feel very confident in the 800 to 1,000 new trucks next year.\nBrad Hicks: And Ken, this is Brad. That's just -- if you remember in the midst of the pandemic, Nick provided some context that he thought because of the pandemic. He lowered the expectation to 600 to 800. Granted, Dedicated sold 1,331 trucks in 2020. Yes, I think, Nick's comments was, we're going to just return to the sort of long-term target of trying to hit 800 to 1,000.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess on the ICS segment, you guys are still thinking to turn in profitable by the second half of the year. Is the strategy there still incremental leverage, so putting new transactions on the platform? And what about the existing brokerage business as well as part of that strategy rely the profitability outlook rely on transiting that business onto the 360 platform. And then how do you repurpose your headcount in that division to be more efficient or in a more digital world?\nBrad Hicks: Yes, Brandon, we've been transitioning our people through modest to severe reorganizations over the last 18 months really in anticipation of what the forward model will be. So a lot of that work has already occurred. And really it's about finalizing our tech development so that we can maximize our own efficiencies with the activities that are on the platform. There's no question that we expect to continue to grow volume. We've touched on a little bit earlier that the abnormal spot volumes will look for a more efficient way to transact in '21. And that's okay, but we know we have to have a lot more momentum focused on bringing on new customers predominantly at the small and midsized shipper level to help us continue to fuel the platform. And that's where we -- as we think about second half, it really is the culmination of the completion of the tech spend and the pivot of overall volume and activity on the platform that swings us back to profitability as we model that out. Now what we saw again in Q4 was somewhat amplified due to the extremely abnormal high-level calling of revenue, if you will, on the stock side, And they didn't just give us a glimpse of what it will be when we get there. We are not anticipating that strength necessarily over these first few months. If it continues to stay as hot as the market, there is a chance that, that could occur a little bit earlier. But we're not talking about day one, we're talking about months, not quarters there. So I think that, that just reaffirms that second half has high confidence on our ability to deliver the positive.\nShelley Simpson: Brandon, let me make a note, too, that during the first half of last year, we talked a little bit about the reorganization. And we talked about that we had resourced our people to actually start calling on customers. And earlier in my comments, I talked about our activity levels being up substantially throughout the year. That's a direct result of our reorganization. So we've already started to see benefits from the platform in a portion of our ICS segment our focus has been really making sure that we complete our internal work for our people, and that's what Brad is referencing are continuing to make investments. We're letting our customers and our carriers drive us on how to create a more efficient way to do business in both of those spends and now will be ongoing. However, we will complete the internal work that will actually marry the externalization of our 360 platform with our internal resources. So think of an automated shipment, they'll actually come off of the conveyor belt, if you will, to our people where we really need to problem solve. Today, that operates in two silos. You'll start to see the leverage that happens inside that. And then last note I'll make on ICS returning to profitability in the second half. Certainly, we're trying to march towards repeating what our fourth quarter performance was. So we've not given up hope that we can continue into Q1 and into Q2, but we do have specific ideas earmarked for our future. And those ideas could put pressure on us, but we will continue. Remember, our strategy is to continue to invest in our people and in our technology so that we can scale the platform. Scale is the most critical component in creating a more efficient network. And so that will be our focus through the first half of this year. And if we can outperform like we did in Q4, I think you'll be pleased with those results.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Okay, great. I guess the good news is I'm probably set on the margin commentary, so the last question won't be on that. Darren, I guess maybe to some of the comments about the timing of the bid implementation into '21, do you think that you'll be able to show margin improvement in the first half of the year? Or is it really a function that you need to see the bids more fully implemented and in the rail service to improve to get to that margin progression or margin improvement kind of in the second half and for a run rate exit the year?\nDarren Field: Well, I think some elements outside of our control can influence that still, given that we are still facing some pandemic conditions out there. Labor continues to be very difficult. I'm not sure exactly when. I know that we're implementing pricing and Shelley outlined it moves a little slower than maybe we would like for it to certainly at this point. But I would expect by summertime, to have new prices implemented. So back half of the second quarter, into the third quarter. You've got a substantial percentage of your book of business with new fresh rates based on the conditions today. And that should be better representative of the pricing market and the results.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. That helps. And then maybe just to close out the call. Shelley, if you think about coming to the end of the spend on 360, as you look out beyond the second half of '21, is your expectation that 360 provides above-market growth just in ICS? Or can you see stronger revenue growth in the other segments? And how much of it's really predicated on seeing revenue growth versus lowering cost? Just kind of how do you see 360 coming together as you move kind of beyond the implementation and the spend base that you've been going through over the last couple of years?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, great question. So one of the things in my standard role to really think about how do we leverage the platform across the organization, and so I'll be able to really focus in on how we do that on behalf of our customers. So if you think about the work that I've mentioned earlier that's in the platform today that should be moving Intermodal, how do we get more prescriptive on the front end of that instead of running a report afterwards, actually making the recommendation and the predicting of how a shipment or recommending how a shipment can move. That's just one example, but many that we see across the organization. And I want to make sure that I clarify something. We are not at the end of our tech spend. We are at the end of our internal work that will connect our external platform with our internal platform. We will continue to invest in J.B. Hunt 360 as we see this as an accelerator for our organization from a revenue perspective. I think you were able to see that in JBT and ICS. It's the first place that we started in our 360 platform, that was really the place that was logically adjacent to the work that we were doing. And so we were able to see the benefit there, but you'll continue to see 360, that's why Nick made in his opening comments remarks around the platform and how we will leverage that. And then finally, I think you'll see this in our annual report, the number of millions amounts that we eliminated from our assets by leveraging the platform, we directly get to see that in cost reduction. And the more our platform scales, the more our own assets should be the most efficient assets or certainly at the top of the most efficient assets available in the market, so continuing to try to drive cost on behalf of our customers.\nJohn Roberts: So I'm going to just take a minute here and close this up for a little bit over our time. So thanks for your patience. I hope we got to most questions. I can say definitely that there's a sense of urgency for us to get this margin question answered because it so dominates our discussion. We really don't get a chance to talk about the more comprehensive advantages that we have. And there's a lot of discussion in our remarks about platform, enterprise companies solving problems for customers that really use all the parts. And so it's important that we hear the volume on this question, and I think we're going to work hard to make sure we get that resolved as soon as we can. But where we are in the use of our systems is encouraging for us and revealed itself a lot, I think, in the fourth quarter. I think our customers look to J.B. Hunt to get answers. They don't look for us to buy services. They find an attitude here, an investment here a mindset that is, call us. We will help you figure this out. And we are entrepreneurial enough to allow ourselves to find new leads. And I think that is a very important element that is longer term in nature. It doesn't necessarily answer the immediate questions, but Highway plus Intermodal plus Dedicated plus Final Mile plus platform, et cetera, is J.B. Hunt. And it's a strong position we're in. The settled nature of our go forward into '21 gives us a -- as good a chance as we're going to have to answer these questions, and we're going to answer whether we like the answer or not, we're going to answer the questions. And I know there's commitment there. I'm excited that we got to a place where we could add equipment in Intermodal. I think that's a very important thing to take away. This fleet will be over 100,000 units in 2021. And as a provider of services and value to customers, we stay alone there. And that, I think, we expect demands a certain place in the market. The Final Mile is exciting. Our pipelines really are in good shape in all of our businesses, frankly. And I'd just add that our leadership team is very cohesive. We've made some changes that you guys can't and like you can't all see from where I sit, but our energy is up. We're asking new questions. We've moved the board around a little bit. And I'm just really excited about that. I think that's something that continued to reveal itself. I think we were pleased and encouraged for the quarter. We'll see how that's received, but we care less about this quarter. We care more about the long term. I'm going to give a final shout-out to the good people of J.B. Hunt who, through 2020, took on a pandemic. And not only did we survive it, we thrived in it, and we actually grew closer together as a team, both at the leadership level but at every level in the Company. And I'm very proud of that. So, we wish you well today, and we'll look forward to our next call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'd like to share how honored I am to be in this new role and just how much excitement there is in the organization for our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions, or ICS, and trucks. My comments this afternoon will focus on the performance of both segments and, as Shelly alluded, how we were able to solve for yes in a very dynamic environment for our customers and deliver the capacity of it in the quarter. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $587 million or 56% growth over the prior year, which was also 36% growth sequentially from the third quarter. As previous calls have referenced, our investments in technology and people have been around enabling us to scale the business, and we were able to see a lens of this dynamic play out in the quarter. As we talked about scaling the business, our focus has been on being able to grow revenue and gross profit at a disproportionate rate to operating costs. We were able to deliver $31 million of sequential gross profit improvement and a corresponding $24 million increase in operating income, which translates into a 77% incremental margin on every dollar of gross profit. Speaking of which, ICS did deliver positive $5.6 million of operating income in the quarter. And while we have shared our expectations for returning to profitability by second half of '21, we are going to stand by that view as there were just a lot of unique dynamics in play in the fourth quarter, and we expect some seasonal effects plus continued investment to keep us on track for delivering on that expectation. In JBT or truck, the segment was able to deliver 50% growth in fourth quarter revenue year-over-year to $140 million. This is the highest achieved -- excuse me, this is the highest revenue achieved in the segment since the third quarter of '08, as Shelley had mentioned in her opening remarks, and we have approximately 70% fewer company-owned trucks versus that time period. As you're beginning to see, the power of the platform allows both ICS and JBT to scale with and for our customers to solve for their needs. And in the fourth quarter, that need was capacity. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by the J.B. Hunt owned equipment, our independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360 offering. This gives us greater options to choose what is best for the customer who is looking for a drop and hook capacity solution. And by best, I mean the most efficient option that eliminates waste in the system. To close out my comments, I would just like to reiterate how Highway Services powered by the platform was able to meet the needs of our customers in the quarter by delivering flexible capacity options. We continue to see strong activity between customers and capacity in our platform, which will continue to support investments into our Highway Services solutions whether it's in the marketplace or within the 360 program. I'd like to turn it back over to Brad Delco. Hey, Amit, this is Brad. I'll let John or Darren add to what I say. But when you think about it, if revenue or cost per load is going up and you're really focused on just margin percent, which I think in the investment community is very focused on, if revenue per load goes up, and contribution on a dollar basis per unit remains consistent or improves, and the capital required to generate that contribution on a dollar basis stays the same, and you can achieve similar ROIC even though there is degradation in the margin. So I know there is so much focus on margin percent. I think the work that will be done this year -- and that we're going to be transparent and communicate with the investment community is, we're going to look at all of the inputs. And we're going to just make sure that we are, in fact, generating what we deem to be appropriate returns on our investment. And we'll update what that margin output is based upon the analysis. So that's my comment, Darren or John, if you want to add anything more to that? And Ken, this is Brad. That's just -- if you remember in the midst of the pandemic, Nick provided some context that he thought because of the pandemic. He lowered the expectation to 600 to 800. Granted, Dedicated sold 1,331 trucks in 2020. Yes, I think, Nick's comments was, we're going to just return to the sort of long-term target of trying to hit 800 to 1,000. Yes, Brandon, we've been transitioning our people through modest to severe reorganizations over the last 18 months really in anticipation of what the forward model will be. So a lot of that work has already occurred. And really it's about finalizing our tech development so that we can maximize our own efficiencies with the activities that are on the platform. There's no question that we expect to continue to grow volume. We've touched on a little bit earlier that the abnormal spot volumes will look for a more efficient way to transact in '21. And that's okay, but we know we have to have a lot more momentum focused on bringing on new customers predominantly at the small and midsized shipper level to help us continue to fuel the platform. And that's where we -- as we think about second half, it really is the culmination of the completion of the tech spend and the pivot of overall volume and activity on the platform that swings us back to profitability as we model that out. Now what we saw again in Q4 was somewhat amplified due to the extremely abnormal high-level calling of revenue, if you will, on the stock side, And they didn't just give us a glimpse of what it will be when we get there. We are not anticipating that strength necessarily over these first few months. If it continues to stay as hot as the market, there is a chance that, that could occur a little bit earlier. But we're not talking about day one, we're talking about months, not quarters there. So I think that, that just reaffirms that second half has high confidence on our ability to deliver the positive."

And good morning -- or excuse me, good afternoon to those of us -- of you joining us on the call today. I had a little technical difficulty there. I'll provide a couple of comments on the fourth quarter from a consolidated perspective and then let the business units cover their segments. Overall, we are pleased with the revenue growth this quarter with notable achievements in the Highway division as well as dedicated. Cost pressures in the fourth quarter were primarily related to higher costs across network and operations due to congestion and labor tightness from increased freight demand, higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers in a capacity-constrained environment, and we also incurred higher group medical costs in the quarter. A quick update on COVID costs. We continue to offer paid time off to our employees that are quarantined due to COVID concerns, and we incurred approximately $5 million of costs in the quarter designated as specific to COVID for a total of approximately $34 million year-to-date. While I believe our facility work is complete, we expect COVID PTO costs to continue given the current level of case counts and will likely be a headwind for us over the near term. We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and changing credit landscape as we enter the new year but are encouraged as we experienced what I would consider to be somewhat of a normal fourth quarter with respect to customer collections. We resumed stock buybacks early in the fourth quarter but found less opportunity in the back half of the quarter and then fell into our blackout period. We anticipate continuing our normal buyback approach in 2021. Sure. I think on the third quarter call, I think I said high single digits to double digits. And I would say that still remains to be a pretty good placeholder for pricing in general for our network. There are certainly key markets where it's substantially higher or it's absolutely in the double-digit area. West Coast capacity costs is a different challenge for us, frankly, than elements of, say, our Eastern network and what's going on there. When I look at the network and think about how will pricing translate in the bid cycle, a lot still has to be seen. We did say high single to low double digits. And I think that, that remains to be a pretty good placeholder. But certainly, there are pockets of our network where I think it will be higher than that."

            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile and also shed some light on our pipeline and some high-level views on our outlook. First, on Dedicated results. Dedicated had another solid quarter that delivered the highest fourth quarter revenue and operating income for our segment in our history. And we have previously discussed the benefits of our diversified customer base and the flexibility of our operations have allowed us to serve with customers who needed while scaling back with customers who have been negatively impacted by the current state of the economy. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solution continues to build as customers and potential customers are faced with rising insurance costs, greater challenges recruiting and retaining a professional driving workforce, and the realization of the capital tied up in their own fleet does not provide them the flexibility that we have been able to deliver for our customers. We ended 2020 selling 1,331 trucks in DCS, which compares to 890 trucks sold year-to-date through the end of September quarter. As you can see in our fourth quarter stats, we added 192 trucks sequentially, which did impact the quarter in terms of start-up costs, and we would expect some pages of fleet growth and start-up costs returning to the business for the near to midterm. Also, we expect the industry has and will continue to face driver wage, pressure and we will be keeping a close eye on it. We monitor the performance of our fleet and believe we have some of the best wages and professional drivers in the industry who enjoy the consistency of working in a dedicated environment. Finally, we do expect to return to the previously stated range of selling 800 to 1,000 trucks a year. On Final Mile Services. Final Mile was able to deliver an all-time record revenue of $223 -- or $213 million or 17% greater than the previous record set last quarter. This growth was driven primarily by new contracted business throughout 2020 and supplemented by acquisitions. In fact, we track our contracted sales progress very similar to DCS, and I was proud of the team's performance in selling $84 million of new business and Final Mile throughout 2020. We are continuing to see strength and robust opportunities for growth across our portfolio and are excited about further building out our exercise equipment channel with the most recent acquisition of mass movement. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in our service and product offering to ensure the highest standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical and rapidly growing part of the supply chain. We believe these investments are critical as we deliver goods inside the home of our customers' customers. As a result of these investments and our desire to provide a differentiated service product, we'll be focusing on appropriate returns in our business to support these investments. Also, while still early in the new role as COO, I thought I would share some high-level thoughts on how I think we can leverage our platform to manage our assets more efficiently across the enterprise. If I learned one thing in DCS over the years, it's the benefit of having density in markets and what flexibility that provides our customers and our own operations. I see tremendous opportunity for us to leverage the platform, to drive greater efficiencies across all assets across the enterprise and look forward to providing future updates in the near future. That concludes my remarks, and so I'll turn it over to Darren now. Yes. That is business that, based on our pipeline -- our pipeline in January, both in Dedicated and Final Mile is stronger than our pipeline January of last year. So we feel very good about our pipeline and those numbers. So not signed deals yet, but it's based on how our pipeline flows, we feel very confident in the 800 to 1,000 new trucks next year."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market trends, our expectations on how this will impact our organization and our customers in 2021 and how J.B. Hunt's investment in innovative culture continue to drive our ability to help us solve for our customers' supply chain needs. It is with little doubt that 2020 was one of the most challenging and dynamic freight markets in my career. The pandemic created a tremendous amount of uncertainty that was felt across the global supply chain. The massive shift from a services to a good economy and the inability for supply chains to keep up with demand have put inventory levels in a precarious position that will take time to rebuild. Import levels have and continued to surge, and congestion and dwell time ports, rail terminals and customer warehouses is also contributing to the inefficient use of available capacity. Combined with the challenges that this pandemic has had directly on our industry heroes are drivers. The supply of qualified and trained driving professionals have been impacted by capacity limitations at driving schools, quarantine protocols, retirements, in addition to pressure as a result of escalating insurance costs in the recent drug and alcohol clearing house. Unfortunately, these challenges have put inflationary cost pressures on our and many businesses and, as the market is anticipating, will put further inflationary pressure on transportation rates in 2021. And Chris, I might note that even if you look at the last five years, we have three years of unusual activity between our relationship with the railroads and also a pandemic. So we do believe 2021 will be a more settled year when it comes to our margin targets. And certainly, that's why we have split up our conversation around new equipment on behalf of our customers. We want to put the initial order in, and then we're going to work through with each customer through the bid process to determine if the returns will be appropriate for us to get inside that range. I might make a note on that as well, just the growth in the Eastern network. If you look at our sales activity, across the enterprise, we are up year-over-year and it accelerated into the fourth quarter, so our customers asking us to solve for their needs in total. And then our benefits of seeing the data in our platform now, we've recognized the number of shipments that actually should or could be moving Intermodal that gives us even more confidence. We saw that number grow substantially throughout the year as well. So the combination of more activity along with what we see in the platform that we actually moved over the highway that should be moving intermodal, those two pieces really help us in our confidence in our plan in the Eastern network. Brian, so similar to what Darren talked about, which is the opportunity for us to work across the enterprise, here coming into the fourth quarter, we certainly felt pressure from our customers from unplanned activity but also just the level of demand not matching the available capacity there was in the market, and we did a great job across the Company solving for our customers. And so think more of what do our customers need, and then we applied what was the best answer based on the capacity that we could source at their price and service that the customer really could work with. We still think there is a huge opportunity in intermodal. I go back to what we see in the platform. It is a significant number of shipments that are moving on the highway that really should convert into Intermodal with more fluidity and our ability to really get the network more in motion. But our objective, Brian, is really to own that business. If you look across our entire organization, whether it's one pallet to everything a customer moves, we now can handle that in North America. And so we're trying to solve for our customers, recognizing there are constraints. But certainly, our mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America, the most efficient is to move into Intermodal. And so we are intense working closely with our customers to do just that. I would just say, Brian that I hope that we can convert out of ICS into our more efficient ways to do business inside the organization. That is a huge focus for us. We are working with our customers. We recognize that there were unplanned activities and costs that don't necessarily make for an efficient way to move goods over the long term. Having said that, we are still very focused on taking market share and making sure that we continue to grow. Our customers are on board, and we did gain very favorable marks from our customers throughout the quarter and ending the year with some of our highest ratings from customers. So our ability to solve was excellent. Now we're trying to solve for overall cost for our customers. And I think that's some of the things that Brad is referencing. We want to get some of this business converted into Intermodal. We know the Eastern network is an easy place for us to start. And then we want to continue to work on where the platform can create benefit for our customers so we can start to grow in those new channels. I might just note, from a customer view, we have a lot of confidence in the orders we placed for both Intermodal and highly services. And you heard Nick talk about the pipeline that he has. So our customers' demand is high. We have confidence that we can get to appropriate returns on that that we have ordered already. And now we just want to make sure we understand, is there more appetite than what we've already set up structurally for 2021? And I will tell you, I think that our customers want more from us than what we are planning right now. But we'll see that through the bid season and be able to establish that. And then to reiterate what Darren said, our margins will improve in Intermodal. That's what we're launching towards. We took care of our customers. We reiterated that through the entire pandemic all through 2020 that we would honor our commitments, and it is very much like what we did in 2017 and 2018. We honored our commitments. We came back to customers in 2018, and our customers matched up with us cost to price. We don't expect to change from that, but we want to walk through our bid season to see if we should take more of a stance on equipment ordering past what we've already committed. Sure. So for the most part, the Company follows similar trends. Intermodal is a little bit different on how much has been priced so far. But if you just look at -- typically, we start a bid season in Q4, and that's kind of what we deem as the start about 10% of our business or so starts in that time period, particularly in Intermodal as who is putting their bids out is more impacted in our Intermodal segment. But as you move forward, we've priced about 35% of our business between 35% and 40% of our business. Of that, somewhere in the mid-teens has been awarded and very little has implemented. A little more in Intermodal has already implemented. If you just want to look at Intermodal, think of it like this Q1, around 20%; Q2, around 35%; Q3, around 30%; and Q4, around 10%. It's in that range, depending on when customers come out with our actual bids. Sometimes, that changes, but that's about the right timing. Correct. Yes. Yes. So from our customers' view, inventory is still an issue. And we do see the labor challenges, particularly coming inbound on the import side. I would say it's been a little bit slower than anticipated here for the last 7 to 10 days. But the forecast really puts us back in line, particularly when you look at what's happening from an import in total volume. We do think that our customers will continue to restock all the way through the first half of the year. And I'm not sure how much of a slowdown we're actually going to see from Chinese New Year, considering that there is a backlog of containers that are trying to come into the port and trying to turn and get out to be deployed. I think that, that will move forward as we come into what would typically be a lull. We do think the West Coast will be tighter than usual from a seasonality perspective, and that will push forward into the rest of what's happening in the truckload market. I would say spot price in general has fallen over the last 7 to 10 days matching what we've seen from a demand perspective, but I don't think anything is out of the norm and still anticipate a stronger-than-normal first half. I would say just across the board, our customers trying to get throughput from an import perspective. Brandon, let me make a note, too, that during the first half of last year, we talked a little bit about the reorganization. And we talked about that we had resourced our people to actually start calling on customers. And earlier in my comments, I talked about our activity levels being up substantially throughout the year. That's a direct result of our reorganization. So we've already started to see benefits from the platform in a portion of our ICS segment our focus has been really making sure that we complete our internal work for our people, and that's what Brad is referencing are continuing to make investments. We're letting our customers and our carriers drive us on how to create a more efficient way to do business in both of those spends and now will be ongoing. However, we will complete the internal work that will actually marry the externalization of our 360 platform with our internal resources. So think of an automated shipment, they'll actually come off of the conveyor belt, if you will, to our people where we really need to problem solve. Today, that operates in two silos. You'll start to see the leverage that happens inside that. And then last note I'll make on ICS returning to profitability in the second half. Certainly, we're trying to march towards repeating what our fourth quarter performance was. So we've not given up hope that we can continue into Q1 and into Q2, but we do have specific ideas earmarked for our future. And those ideas could put pressure on us, but we will continue. Remember, our strategy is to continue to invest in our people and in our technology so that we can scale the platform. Scale is the most critical component in creating a more efficient network. And so that will be our focus through the first half of this year. And if we can outperform like we did in Q4, I think you'll be pleased with those results. Yes, great question. So one of the things in my standard role to really think about how do we leverage the platform across the organization, and so I'll be able to really focus in on how we do that on behalf of our customers. So if you think about the work that I've mentioned earlier that's in the platform today that should be moving Intermodal, how do we get more prescriptive on the front end of that instead of running a report afterwards, actually making the recommendation and the predicting of how a shipment or recommending how a shipment can move. That's just one example, but many that we see across the organization. And I want to make sure that I clarify something. We are not at the end of our tech spend. We are at the end of our internal work that will connect our external platform with our internal platform. We will continue to invest in J.B. Hunt 360 as we see this as an accelerator for our organization from a revenue perspective. I think you were able to see that in JBT and ICS. It's the first place that we started in our 360 platform, that was really the place that was logically adjacent to the work that we were doing. And so we were able to see the benefit there, but you'll continue to see 360, that's why Nick made in his opening comments remarks around the platform and how we will leverage that. And then finally, I think you'll see this in our annual report, the number of millions amounts that we eliminated from our assets by leveraging the platform, we directly get to see that in cost reduction. And the more our platform scales, the more our own assets should be the most efficient assets or certainly at the top of the most efficient assets available in the market, so continuing to try to drive cost on behalf of our customers."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick. Happy New Year, everyone. The quarter presented similar challenges for our Intermodal network fluidity and balance that were presented in the third quarter, similar to what we communicated that we expected would occur on our last call. This afternoon, my comments will focus on network fluidity in balance, the demand pricing environment, and then I want to talk about 2021 and our focus for this year. First, our volumes were minus 2% in October, flat in November and plus 6% in December. Rail provider velocity challenges and terminal congestion weighed heavy on our container fleet productivity during the quarter. While we weren't able to move all the volume available to us, we were able to accomplish one of our top priorities that we have communicated since the start of the pandemic, and that is honoring our capacity commitments to our customers. Throughout the quarter, we utilized a much higher percentage of the outsourced dredge capacity in an effort to drive productivity through the network. This included efforts to pull containers from the rail terminals to assist in the congestion challenges. We also rerouted significant volume over Phoenix, Arizona and Stockton, California that would have normally moved from a Southern California origin rail terminal. These higher costs of the drayage operation are reflected in the results of the quarter. Our customers participated with incremental revenue to help cover those costs, but that revenue fell short of providing the same margin as what we would have seen without that activity. We have commented on the labor challenges we are all facing during the pandemic on the previous earnings calls. California was particularly difficult during the quarter. We certainly believe the rail network faced some labor challenges at terminals and at locations where we believe our rail providers expect and will deliver better productivity in the future, certainly better than what we experienced in the quarter. I make these comments primarily to highlight that we faced conditions in the fourth quarter that we can address and improve as we move out of the pandemic. So far in January, volume demand remains extremely strong, and the cost to serve our customers remains elevated. Rail velocity and congestion has improved for now, but labor challenges and increased demand will continue to impact rail velocity as the year goes on. We fully expect pricing in this bid cycle will cover the cost increases that we are experiencing that are more structural in nature in our network. We believe 2021 will present opportunities for us to make progress on the margin front. Costs on all fronts, dray, rail and productivity have all come at us at a fast pace in 2020, and this New Year presents our opportunity to price those costs into our business. We must find growth opportunities that complement our network and provide balanced benefits while also increasing core pricing that reflects the current cost to serve our market. The very early and small percentage of pricing results achieved, thus far are encouraging. We are confident that our customers want to grow with us at prices that support investment in capacity expansion. We have ordered over 6,000 containers that will be manufactured in 2021, and we have flexibility on how and when those containers will be rolled out. We have strong confidence in the ability of our network to consume growth, particularly in the East. We also recognize that we still have significant cost and velocity challenges in Southern California, and simply adding containers is not the only solution required to grow capacity in that key market. BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working together to find better capacity solutions for our customers, and our prices will reflect those efforts. Importantly, as we progress through bid season, we do have opportunities to increase our container order if market dynamics support the need for additional capacity. Throughout 2020, our employees have been the backbone of our conviction to honor the commitments we made to our customers. I am so thankful to our employee base for that conviction, and I believe we will translate that culture into benefits for our financial performance and our returns in 2021. That completes my prepared comments, so now I will turn it over to Brad Hicks. So Chris, this is Darren. I'm going to start with that. I think when John highlighted those comments we just know that the performance of our Intermodal margin over several years now would be a question on the call. And rather than try to talk through exactly when in 2021, exactly at what time would we have a public release with some change, we just wanted to highlight, hey, we do agree that 2021 is a year that we need to make progress. We fully need to -- in the pricing market and what's going on around us feels like it's the right time to talk about that. The other thing that I think John highlighted is that the margin comments relative to Intermodal aren't alone, and he was highlighting commentary about the enterprise and other business units. And that's why I think John wanted to talk about that. Yes. Well, I think, look, I'm confident in the way we communicate with our rail provider out West. We are aligned in efforts to try to drive capacity out there. I'm also confident in the way our organization on our enterprise solves for capacity challenges. I do think that, obviously, there may be a little reprieve in the parcel demand and some other impacts on the rail network. And the full truckload Intermodal seems to have some momentum in terms of our ability to drive capacity out West. So I think we'll have a better position going forward in the first quarter than we felt in the early part of the fourth quarter around moving empties out West. That doesn't mean that we'll be moving as many as the customers would like for us to move. So congestion and velocity slowdown has been a challenge, but I think the fourth -- the first quarter of '21 does present the potential for better velocity than what we experienced in Q4. So there was meaningful opportunity for us in the Eastern network during the fourth quarter that we had to delay implementing Intermodally. We serve those customers with our highway solutions, but we were delaying implementing some new business in the East during the fourth quarter while our equipment was consumed in serving some customers on the West Coast. As we go through the first quarter, we have already experienced growth in the East Coast and feel confident that, that will continue to be available to us. That growth is not tied to customers rerouting to different imports. That's highway conversion of business that has been available for us for some time now through the back half of last year. We are aware of some customers that are talking about altering their import strategy. We'll continue to look at what their plans are, and we'll provide solutions as those opportunities present themselves. We certainly believe the Eastern network moves more fluidly than what we had experienced in the West, certainly in the fourth quarter, but we fully expect the whole network to see gradual improvements as '21 continues. Well, certainly, from a volume perspective, I understand the highlight on the question around particularly looking back on the fourth quarter, there was significantly more volume available to us in the market than what we were able to handle based on velocity challenges that were going on. And we still feel strongly. And Shelley mentioned it we're bringing on customers with Intermodal at the right time when we have capacity available. That doesn't mean that we're taking capacity away from a commitment that we've already made. As we go into '21, we did talk about, we've ordered more containers. We expect pricing to accommodate. Potentially is if velocity as our rail system today is more structurally slower than what it was four or five years ago, then pricing is going to have to contemplate that when we think about investment in those long-term assets. And so that's a big focus for us, but we did highlight that we're buying equipment this year because we're confident in the customers' desire to buy that service. So -- and as Brad mentioned, I mean, we do expect Intermodal volumes to grow at least as strong as the industry. I do think in the back half of last year that was a challenge for us particularly in the network and the weighting where we were relative to capacity demands on the West Coast. And as moving forward, we're going to have to grow where capacity is available. And then look to change operations in the markets where capacity is difficult and how do we drive efficiency out west. And we highlighted that we're engaged in conversations with a rail provider there, and we do believe we can both be more efficient in the coming years out West. No, no. We want to grow -- we're going to grow volume in 2021, and we're going to expand margin. We need to do both, and the market will support both. Sure. I'll answer the last question first. There's not a railroad waiting in line to lower the cost. I'll wait on that phone call for -- no, that's not happening. There are markets where, yes, Intermodal prices probably do need to outpace truckload rates. But there are markets where the Intermodal prices can be at, maybe even below truckload market price changes. So it's a little bit broad to make a statement that Intermodal rates need to outpace truckload rates. I don't think they do. And I don't think they necessarily will throughout our entire network. But there are some key pockets where, yes, I absolutely think they will. Yes. I think as the quarter went on, there was a small reprieve in our ability to reposition empties out West, and that showed up in December a little bit better than it had earlier in the quarter. Some of it might be related to a weakness in December of 2019, frankly. But certainly, January so far has been what we expected it to be, and that has been -- demand has been strong, and our network is more fluid. I don't think anybody is trying to get. Okay, Scott, I don't think we're trying to suggest anything other than acknowledge that the Intermodal margin has been a primary topic for our investors for some time. We're coming out of a very turbulent period. Shelley highlighted that, gosh, for three years, we've had charges from arbitration. We're in the middle of a pandemic. We've got driver hiring challenges. The outsourced market is extremely difficult. We honored commitments to our customers. And as we go through 2021, we are hopeful and have the expectation that I'm not going to -- I want to be cautious on using stability. But certainly, a lot of those challenges will fall behind us. The market certainly is ready to support strong price increases, and we'll see what we can do. I think that's been our message is that we'd like a more stable year to evaluate that. And that's really the bulk of what the message was. Well, I mean, we've said for many years now that we care first about our return profile. And really, Brad, I think you highlighted it. That's our measuring stick. And that's how we're going to think about have we been successful in our approach to managing the investments in our assets, are we presenting a strong enough return. And I'm quite certain that, that's what John holds me accountable to do is to find improvements in the way that our return profile is. So that's our focus in '21. Well, I think in the period of time pre-COVID, you saw box turns that were similar to what they are in COVID, but we had significant amounts of capacity in storage that had been bought at periods of time when velocity was challenged and congestion existed in periods leading up to 2019.We have grown our fleet to deal with a little bit weaker terms and pricing was -- returns were supporting that. As we came into 2020, terms were not built around the size of our fleet, and our volume was not yet where we had anticipated it would be based on how large our fleet was. So we were anticipating velocity and improvements in 2020, and we were experiencing that right up until the pandemic. So really, starting in June, demand went off the charts, and everything slowed down a bit. And so yes, you're not seeing any kind of significant change in trends. And that's relevant to how bad congestion has impacted the amount of time it takes a container to travel on Intermodal loads today is longer than it was a year ago. And we would expect for that to improve this year -- or I should say it was longer in Q4. We should expect that, that transit will either improve this year or the pricing will reflect that we have to own the asset for a longer amount of time in order to accommodate the load for the customer. And that's how we're going to view it. But I do expect congestion and velocity in our system to gradually improve in '21. Well, I think our lean this year is actually more to price than it is anything else. We've got to expand our margins, but we are confident in our ability with the equipment acquisitions that we're making in order to do that. I probably can't get too specific there, Justin. I just know this, that when you look at the fourth quarter, the amount of outsourcing we did was significant on the drayage front. We had employees of our own in quarantine. I think John Kuhlow mentioned how much the Company had spent on PTO related to COVID time for our employees. Yet, we're replacing the capacity that, that employee was going to present by going to the open market and bringing outsourced costs that were significantly elevated in 2020. And so that's some of the major drivers of margin challenges in the fourth quarter. Service and velocity is a component of it. But really in the back half of last year, and particularly in the fourth quarter, drayage cost increases as we had to go to the outsourced market were significant. Well, I think some elements outside of our control can influence that still, given that we are still facing some pandemic conditions out there. Labor continues to be very difficult. I'm not sure exactly when. I know that we're implementing pricing and Shelley outlined it moves a little slower than maybe we would like for it to certainly at this point. But I would expect by summertime, to have new prices implemented. So back half of the second quarter, into the third quarter. You've got a substantial percentage of your book of business with new fresh rates based on the conditions today. And that should be better representative of the pricing market and the results."

All kidding aside, we are thankful to enter 2021 to start a new chapter and to continue our intended journey. 2020 taught us many lessons, not the least of which is that we have a community of employees, drivers and providers that are more than capable of dealing with change in crisis. The past year also revealed the essential nature of the services we provide as we experienced challenging and dynamic but ever-present demand through 2020. We affirmed again that all of the businesses we have committed to and invest again complement each other and create a very differentiated model for our customers. We look ahead to 2021 and beyond with confidence. During the fourth quarter, we experienced some very traditional demand cycles from customers across all services consistent with holiday activities. These needs were coupled with unusual inventory restocking and import challenges, particularly on the West Coast. Our fleet in the highway and contract businesses presented reliable capacity, held up well, and we discovered new ways to integrate our assets across customers and accounts. Yes. Thank you, Brian. The comment was that we would still maintain get into profitability in the second half of this year. And there's no question that with the profits that were generated in the fourth quarter that we anticipated that question. But the reality is that the fourth quarter of '20 really did have some pretty abnormal things that drove incremental volume our way. As Shelly just mentioned, our ability to say yes and find that answer for our customers. But each and every one of them are now reevaluating what their network and what their makeup of carrier mix is going to be for 2021. So we still have work to do on our tech investments that will be somewhat of a drag for us in the first half as we close out the investment component And so as we think about that, there's just a little bit of unusual in this in Q4 that makes it very hard to predict as we move into 2021. What I would say is that we are incredibly satisfied with how the platform performs with that rapid growth and that rapid pressure of customer needs. And so it does tell us that we're on the right track, and we have a high confidence level to reiterate our previous expectations. Shelly, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? I think it's just too early to say. We'll -- that I'll leave Tom. We don't give that specific of guidance, and so we're going to avoid answering that. Yes. I'll just add, Scott. This is John, that there are a number of items that are -- we hope are behind, like arbitration PSR. The pandemic has been this year and some of the outputs of that are things like -- I was talking to Craig earlier, I know, Nick, you've got some day on this. Driver availability is in a new place today. And so while we're going to go to the market for rates to help deal with changes and evolution in our cost structure to get back to that place we think we should be, by the way. And I hope we're being very clear because I think we have a duty to be clear that we haven't changed our expectations. We believe this year will solidify in a more settled -- I'd like the term, Shelley, settled environment. Now it's not a smooth environment. It's sort of the ongoing current state. Let's look at driver availability, as I was just referencing. Driver schools are under duress, okay? Drivers are retiring, and schools are putting out new drivers. That puts a unique pressure. That's going to be ongoing though. The things around PSR and arbitration, all that; we think, are more settled. So we've got to go to market, and we've got to see if the customer is willing to pay for J.B. Hunt to provide company assets to do dray, to present a large fleet, to have a presence that can serve, that can do things that we've been able to do in the past. They're going to answer that question for us through this year in their decisions around how they award business and outlook rates. If we can't get that answer to get us back to 11% to 13%, then I'm going to make sure we communicate that and all the things that go with it. But we're not there in early indications and conversations we're having with Shelley and the sales team and Darren and his team and all that. We still have optimism that the customer needs what we provide, and it's unique, by the way, And we want to keep providing it, but we need that support, and we need those margins to return to achieve the returns that we've enjoyed in the past. And that's really where we are. I also think it's important to say, it's not just Intermodal margins, which was purely the purpose of that part of my opening remarks that the whole company has to take a really deep breath and look at where we are going to both. We also need to look at where we are dedicated Because as we split that business out, we're saying, hey, we need to look at that business, the returns of the assets required for that business. And we need to make sure we're on steady, again, the term steady footing for what we can present in terms of expectations, not only to you but to our customers as we set price and as we establish contract. Same is true for our truckload business. We're looking at, hey, there's a place here with the growth we experienced in the fourth quarter. And some of the nuances that we're experimenting with around trailers, we might be able to remodel our capital thoughts in Truckload that might be able to be supported by a different margin profile. And I'm just trying to coordinate that conversation as not a one-time event, a one-off. I think the Company has a duty to evaluate its expectations. And this is the year that we're calling out we're going to do that. I think we'll be able to give you progress reports along the way. And I think there'll be a lot of clarity or pay with it. And one of the comments I made earlier, we want to provide our customers with the services we currently present and -- but we expect and demand a proper return on that investment. If the customer says, hey, I don't -- I can't support that. And we've actually seen that a little bit. You mentioned final model, there was a period where we were only company assets, and the expense related to that and the margins required for that service were not supported in the market. So we've taken off of that offering. And today, we've seen a great growth path and being able to offer a different capital profile that can run at different margins and still present the kind of returns that we expect as Darren said. That's been our North Star for a very long time, and it serves us well, and we aren't about to abandon it. So if we get back results from this bid work, it says, hey, we can't achieve that 11 13. Okay, then what do we do next? How do we look at our fleet profile and consider different approaches to how we offer that service? That would end up in even at lower margins, similar to better return performance. And that's how we're going to do it. So I'm going to just take a minute here and close this up for a little bit over our time. So thanks for your patience. I hope we got to most questions. I can say definitely that there's a sense of urgency for us to get this margin question answered because it so dominates our discussion. We really don't get a chance to talk about the more comprehensive advantages that we have. And there's a lot of discussion in our remarks about platform, enterprise companies solving problems for customers that really use all the parts. And so it's important that we hear the volume on this question, and I think we're going to work hard to make sure we get that resolved as soon as we can. But where we are in the use of our systems is encouraging for us and revealed itself a lot, I think, in the fourth quarter. I think our customers look to J.B. Hunt to get answers. They don't look for us to buy services. They find an attitude here, an investment here a mindset that is, call us. We will help you figure this out. And we are entrepreneurial enough to allow ourselves to find new leads. And I think that is a very important element that is longer term in nature. It doesn't necessarily answer the immediate questions, but Highway plus Intermodal plus Dedicated plus Final Mile plus platform, et cetera, is J.B. Hunt. And it's a strong position we're in. The settled nature of our go forward into '21 gives us a -- as good a chance as we're going to have to answer these questions, and we're going to answer whether we like the answer or not, we're going to answer the questions. And I know there's commitment there. I'm excited that we got to a place where we could add equipment in Intermodal. I think that's a very important thing to take away. This fleet will be over 100,000 units in 2021. And as a provider of services and value to customers, we stay alone there. And that, I think, we expect demands a certain place in the market. The Final Mile is exciting. Our pipelines really are in good shape in all of our businesses, frankly. And I'd just add that our leadership team is very cohesive. We've made some changes that you guys can't and like you can't all see from where I sit, but our energy is up. We're asking new questions. We've moved the board around a little bit. And I'm just really excited about that. I think that's something that continued to reveal itself. I think we were pleased and encouraged for the quarter. We'll see how that's received, but we care less about this quarter. We care more about the long term. I'm going to give a final shout-out to the good people of J.B. Hunt who, through 2020, took on a pandemic. And not only did we survive it, we thrived in it, and we actually grew closer together as a team, both at the leadership level but at every level in the Company. And I'm very proud of that. So, we wish you well today, and we'll look forward to our next call."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Brad Delco, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nBrad Delco: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before I introduce the speakers on today's call, I'd like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our Interim CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller and SVP of Finance, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and President of Highway Services; Nick Hobbs, President of Dedicated and Final Mile Services; and Darren Field, President of Intermodal. At this time, I'd like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks Brad. Well, we are all learning to live with the changes that have been presented by the virus. When we began in mid-March, the response to a very sudden change in how we do business was incredible. From day one, we had to pivot to a new normal on the go and we are so proud of our teams across the country for the different ways we have found to make it work. As noted, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and from the start, take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. Initially, the adrenalin pushed us through, but over time, we start to see while we work together in person, the benefits of being together and collaborating, building on our culture, solving problems as a team and sharing time with each other showed their value to us more now than ever. This reality is profit good work to find ways to begin coming back together, particularly in our corporate offices very slowly and very carefully. We should also call out that due to the nature of the business, 75% of our people in the field have been effectively in position since day one of the crisis, our drivers and so many of the people that support them. We are extremely grateful to all of our employees, both at corporate and in the field and thank them for their commitment. The third quarter showed us some new opportunities and spiking customer demands across all businesses that I don't recall seeing in the past. At different points, we regrettably had to turn away business that was offered but not built into our original network plans and commitments. The supply side of the equation, our carriers and our rail providers all experienced pressure and congestion during the quarter. Also due to what we believe is a labor shortage at our customers causing unloading delays, we have not been able to turn our trailing equipment, as well as we have been able to in the past. Topping off the list is an abnormally high demand to higher company drivers for both replacement and growth. Currently, we are entering the typical annual bid cycles with more uncertainty about capacity and demand. We are actively discussing directional ideas for the next 12 months to 18 months internally and with our customers, including support for fleet expansion in the Intermodal and Highway Services trailing equipment. ROIC has long been our guiding principle when it comes to determining where to allocate capital. We ask ourselves, what does the customer need and can we generate a proper return on the investments to serve those needs? How can we advance the agreements and relationships we have with customers to better align our deal cycles with our equipment cycles? Personally, I think annual jump ball bids are dated and not good for the customers. We can't jump ball our equipment every year. Encouragingly, we have seen some progress in modernizing the business models in Intermodal and Highway Services. We hope that will continue. I will ask our business leaders to cover the segments. For the overall current state of our business, let me just say that I continue to be encouraged with the work being done in our digital transformation with 360 marketplace, not only within our brokerage business but also as a tool set for us to use with other asset and non-asset services. I'm also encouraged with the progress so far in developing our big and bulky Final Mile Services. This includes the performance of our acquisitions before COVID and also the organic growth we have experienced. Both of these key plays recalls to help the Company evolve several years ago, and as with any difficult business we need time to reveal the progress. We will continue to lean into both of these channels going forward. Our more established lines, Intermodal and Dedicated, give us a solid base to work from, and we believe that both of these businesses present sound growth and return profiles going forward. Let me close by saying that during the past eight months, I have witnessed the true test of what I have had long believed to be a culture at J.B. Hunt that is centered on people, a commitment to each other and our duty to serve our customers. We see that duty as a privilege and know that we need each other to get the job done. I have seen true leadership from our executives in every aspect of growing the Company, and I look forward to building out our 2021 and 2022 plans together with this great team. With that I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thanks John, and good morning, everyone joining us on the call today. I'll provide a couple of quick comments on the third quarter from a consolidated perspective, and then let the business unit leaders cover their segments. The most prevalent cost impacts in the quarter were driven by the disruption in our networks due to congestion and capacity tightness from labor challenges. We saw other direct costs related to the pandemic begin to moderate during the quarter. We continue to offer paid time off for our employees that have quarantined, as well as invest heavily and caring for our employees through protective equipment and workstation enhancements as we return to office. We incurred approximately $4 million of specific costs in the quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic for a total of $29 million year-to-date. We performed well in repositioning and redeploying our people and assets as effectively as possible to avoid furloughs and layoffs, which was the right call given the labor challenges noted. We continue to carefully review our spend, balancing the need to invest for the long term, but being mindful of our current environment and resource needs. Regarding the management of accounts receivable, we are pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to handle payment issues, and we saw customer loss reserves return to pre-pandemic levels during the third quarter. We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and the change in credit landscape. As we've communicated throughout the year, our long-term approach to capital management has not changed. However, like the second quarter and given the uncertainty in the freight markets and the pandemic, we made intentional adjustments to our approach for the sake of protecting liquidity. While still confident in our balance sheet strength and investment-grade status, we maintained higher cash positions through the third quarter as we felt it prudent given uncertainty in market liquidity. Accordingly, we ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in cash, with the resulting net debt just under $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at 1 times EBITDA and anticipate staying within close range of that metric. As of today, we're forecasting our full-year 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million, which includes revenue equipment as well as approximately $100 million of technology investment in our core transportation management system. Overall, we're pleased with our balance sheet strength and feel we are in a great position to invest in our long-term asset and technology plans. That's all I had prepared, and I will now turn it over to Nick Hobbs to expand on Dedicated and Final Mile.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend my time this morning discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile segments. I'll also provide some updates on our pipeline and give some high level expectations for these businesses in the future. I'll start with Dedicated or DCS. DCS had another solid quarter highlighted by strong executional performance that delivered a 5% improvement in operating income year-over-year on roughly a similar tractor fleet. In addition, strong utilization of our assets, the benefits of greater density in [0:15:39.6] our operating region, performance was also driven by lower driver turnover, lower T&E expense versus the prior year, and less customer start-up cost. As we stated last quarter, we expected new contract wins to be offset by some attrition at accounts, given all the unique challenges, the current environment and the pandemic that has presented us a broad and diverse portfolio of customers. And that would ultimately keep our truck fleet account stable for the remainder of the year. While that is still the case, we are feeling a lot better about the pipeline, which I will address next. As of September 30th, we have sold 890 trucks worth of new dedicated business year-to-date, which compares to 430 trucks sold as of our last quarter. As a reminder, we had previously expected to sell 600 to 800 trucks worth of new business this year, and I am proud to have achieved this goal a quarter early. We have seen a meaningful uptick in conversations and conversion of opportunities to sign contracts over the last three months. Customer challenges, including lack of available drivers, our insurance cost, the desire of companies to allocate capital to their core businesses, in addition to some of the flexibilities offered by professionally outsourced dedicated fleet solution, are all driving greater demand for our services. Our service and ability to adapt to customer needs throughout the pandemic has served as a testament to the value we bring, which we believe is evidenced by this positive update on our pipeline. Looking out, we continue to target 11% to 13% operating margins over the long term, as customers' start-up cost, higher driver wages, recruiting cost, and travel and entertainment expenses normalize. Now shifting gears to Final Mile or FMS. FMS was able to deliver all-time record revenue of $182 million in the quarter or 22% growth versus the year-ago period and return to slight profitability as we predicted last quarter. We are seeing strength across our portfolio in the furniture, appliance and pool distribution business, with ample opportunities for growth in new market segments, like home exercise equipment and home improvement. To put it bluntly, the pipeline of opportunities is as strong as I've ever seen it. As a result, we are continuing to invest in our product and service offering to ensure the high standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical component of the supply chain, as we deliver products of our customer's customer. Looking out, we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities in this rapidly growing channel. That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on our performance in Highway Services, which includes both ICS and Truck, how we continue to respond to complex challenges on behalf of our customers, and an update on our investments in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, as well as 360 box. First I'm extremely proud of the progress the team in both ICS and JBT made in the quarter on many strategic and operational front, as we and the industry continue to face unique challenges. ICS was able to deliver a record $431 million in revenue in the quarter, a 28% increase year-over-year and a 42% increase versus the second quarter. More encouraging is ICS' ability to capitalize on this growth despite only a 5.5% increase in operating costs in this segment, highlighting the benefits of scale and leveraging the build out of our platform. JBT delivered 16% revenue growth versus the prior period, despite a 7% decline in average truck count, as JBT continues to evolve into a more of an asset-light service offering, with the continued rollout in investment in 360 box. As a result, third-party capacity providers have tremendous visibility to select power-only loads, calling our trailers, utilizing our 360 box trailer pool. We continue to see promising data across both ICS and JBT, related to our customer activity and engagement and our ability to scale the model to grow to meet the needs of our customers. Next, I'm also extremely encouraged by our team's ability to help customers solve for their capacity challenges by providing solutions, tailor to what fit the customers' unique needs. The marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 provides the platform to serve whatever customer wants whether that is a J.B. Hunt asset or a third party carrier solution, committed or spot capacity or guaranteed tender acceptance, and at the service levels that beat industry standards, whether the alternative is an asset or non-asset solution. In addition, we provide tremendous visibility with data and market analytics to help our customers to make informed decisions that will save them money through greater efficiencies. All of J.B. Hunt segments have visibility into the platform as well with the ability to leverage opportunities to drive efficiencies with our own assets. As you will hear from Darren, this helps us serve customers and meet our commitments when circumstances might not otherwise allow. It's a comprehensive approach to being able to the best of our ability to tell our customers yet, when we or others might otherwise say no. We will continue to focus on partnering with customers that see the value of our comprehensive team approach with our goal to build raising tend. In closing, our investments remain focused on our people, technology and scaling the platform, and we continue to be on track with our long-term plan. As we stated in our last call, scaling the platform is one of the greatest risk and opportunities to achieving our long-term target, and our recent performance is even more encouraged. In the third quarter, 360 saw truckload volume growth of 22%, an all-time records in the number of carriers, users and loads on the platform. In JBT, we are and will continue to make investments, albeit on a smaller scale, in building out our 360 box program. We see that business continuing to evolve into a more asset-light blend of trailers, third-party carriers, with some blend of company trucks and being complementary value-added service offering to our customers. I'd now like to turn it over to Darren to talk about Intermodal.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Today, I wanted to focus my comments on three key topics; network performance, the current demand in pricing environment and some general thoughts around how we begin to move forward from here. First, I continue to be encouraged with our team's relentless effort to solve capacity challenges for our customers, despite what I view as the most difficult environment from a network balance and fluidity perspective I have seen during my career. Rail terminal congestion and a slower pace of unloading at customer destinations have contributed to a meaningful slowdown in the velocity of the supply chain and thus the productivity of our equipment. The primary theme across both of these challenges is centered around labor shortages. Our rail providers are working through labor shortages at some key rail terminal operations, while we are confident that they will get back to their productivity targets, which negatively impacted the quarter. Also, our customers have also been challenged with labor at the warehouses, and the time it takes to unload our equipment has increased meaningfully year-over-year, impacting our overall equipment productivity and otherwise available capacity we can provide to the market. At JBI, we have also experienced cost challenges related to availability of labor given the tight and extremely difficult driver market, which negatively impacted margins in the quarter. We are making progress on the driver front, but the driver shortage remains a challenge for the industry. We certainly expect some improvements in all of these areas moving forward, but we don't yet know if we can achieve even last year's velocity in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, volume demand was extremely strong. The challenges from weaker velocity began to impact us in late July and continued throughout the quarter. Volume growth in July was 6%, August was flat, and September grew 2%. Across the board, our customers have asked us to provide more capacity. Our ability to flow empty equipment back to the West Coast to support the eastbound demand was limited during the quarter due to the Velocity challenges previously mentioned, which we estimate prevented us from completing as many as 20,000 more loads in the quarter. Many of you may want to ask if we were able to yield and manage our capacity during the quarter in an effort to chase higher prices. At J.B. Hunt, we communicated two priorities as the pandemic began. Number 1, the health and well-being of our employees; and two, to honor commitments we made to our customers. We believe a business it takes care of its people and honors its commitments to customers, particularly in challenging times, is a recipe for long-term sustainable growth. With that in mind, all of our capacity has been consumed with meaning minimum commitments during this difficult capacity constrained environment. On a positive note, we have worked closely with both ICS, JBT and DCS to provide additional capacity solutions for our customers, while we continue to focus on work -- our work to improve velocity in our network. We believe that working collectively to provide solutions for our customers provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. As we move forward into Q4 and 2021, we don't see anything changing on the demand front. We continue to make small steps of progress on the velocity front. At this stage of the peak season shipping cycle, we expect the velocity challenges experienced in Q3 to continue in Q4 with small improvements in all the areas. The pricing bid cycles for 2021 is just beginning. Certainly, we would expect a lot of discussion with our customers regarding capacity planning and cost management. We are prepared to expand our container fleet for growth, but we will need to balance appropriate targeted returns on our investments to do so, and we will engage with all of our customers with that thought in mind. In closing my prepared comments, I want to say that we're not satisfied with these results in our volume trends, margin performance or equipment utilization. We are not changing our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%, and we continue to believe we have a pathway to improvements in this area. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back to you, Brad.\nBrad Delco: Thanks Darren. And just as a reminder to all those on the call, ask for you to just provide one question and one very quick follow-up, so we can get to as many questions as possible. So Stephanie, I'll turn it over to you to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore.\nJon Chappell: Thank you very much. Darren, I just wanted to ask you that - the volume trends were good to hear. As we think about the repositioning, the imbalances, even the shortages of labor, did that get any better July to September, entering October? Especially considering that the volumes were may be the greatest in July or was it kind of equally bad throughout the quarter and no kind of meaningful improvement yet as you through the first month of this quarter?\nDarren Field: Well I would say, and frankly in July, we had a slightly better fluidity in the system. As we got into the back half, really August, throughout the quarter, we have continued to really struggle with the velocity of the equipment. So July had 6% growth, as we highlighted over the previous July of 2019. As we went throughout the quarter though, velocity of the equipment and our ability to relocate empties has remained very challenging, and so far in October that challenge continues.\nJon Chappell: And then Shelley, super quick follow-up for you just on the ICS, the growth on the topline has been tremendous, but the margin pressure remains. Any change to the thought of becoming breakeven in that business by the middle of next year? Does that get pushed to the right at all given some of the investments that you're making?\nShelley Simpson: Well, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are encouraged with the growth we are experiencing and also the appetite that our customers have to really be interested in doing business differently. John talked about that in his opening comments that the jump ball scenario we believe could be something different and we are pushing inside 360 to deliver that on behalf of our customers. Having said that, we have more confidence and as we progress through the quarter and into the fourth quarter that our comments around the second half of next year remain intact and that we should return to profitability by sometime next year second half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: So maybe thinking specifically about some of the cost, the elevated cost on the Intermodal side in the third quarter, it doesn't sound like they all come out of 4Q. But can you give us maybe a little bit of a cadence of how we should think about, sort of regaining fluidity and what that means from a cost perspective? Understanding that you still think that the longer-term margin guidance is intact, how quickly can you kind of recover towards those levels?\nDarren Field: Yes, as we get into the bid cycle, we're talking about that very challenge with our customers. I think we've - you've heard that theme from our comments so far, as we've - we've got to find a way to deal with that a little bit differently than what we've done in the past. So, the reality is we need time to implement new prices. Certainly, we need the rail system congestion to be relieved somewhat. I don't really expect that to happen in Q4. And as we move into 2021 clearly, I would expect some congestion challenges to relieve a little bit in the first quarter that would be normal, but nothing about 2020 has been normal so far. So we'll have to wait and see. But certainly, new pricing, which would also help to cover some of our cost challenges, is not likely to be visible until Q2 or even Q3 of next year. And that's when we would get the bulk of the business repriced as we go through the bid cycle.\nChris Wetherbee: And then the quick follow-up is just on the loads. When we think about the fourth quarter, what it sounds like you're saying is fleets not necessarily getting bigger on a year-over-year perspective, fluidity is not necessarily getting better. So you're not going to get utilization enhancements from where you were in 3Q. So roughly kind of, that lower single-digit run rate is a reasonable expectation?\nDarren Field: Well, I don't know that we're ready to provide any kind of guidance on volume, but like I said, I don't really anticipate velocity changes to be beneficial during Q4. And so, it's difficult to think that we would have any kind of material benefit coming in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Darren, I very much appreciate the comment on pricing, just now. I was hoping if you can just remind us of the cadence of how much of the - I assume in the third quarter, none of the book of business in Intermodal reflected pricing that is reflective of what's happening in truck? Or if you could talk to us - you said 2Q, 3Q, the bulk of the business, but is the majority - is it kind of equally through the fourth quarter? You get 20% of the book repriced and could you just help us with that cadence? And then I appreciate - I'm sure the shippers appreciated kind of J.B. Hunt's standing by them with respect to honoring contract commitments. But that kind of implies that both shippers that apply to J.B. Hunt workload which kind of fell to the floor? And if you could just talk about that dynamic because it seems like there are certain carriers out there, that will be visiting kind of what minimum contract volumes were? When the equation was the other way - and the pricing leverage was in the hands of shippers? If you can just talk about kind of the exercise you guys did there to make sure that there wasn't necessarily money that was being left on the table from a pricing perspective in the third quarter?\nDarren Field: Well, from an implementation standpoint, I think what you're hearing is we do want to engage with customers and trying to rethink how we typically do this. It's - the jump ball is difficult, and in fast changing times around us, it really gets amplified in terms of how harsh it can be on us. And probably, maybe some customers feel the same way if it's move in the other direction. But historically, we would implement new prices on the smallest percentage of our business during Q4. So call it 10% to 15% of the business. It's a new price on it. Implemented and running through the system during the quarter. Q1 would be more like 25% to 30%, and the same for Q2 and Q3. So if you just kind of break it into, maybe call it, 30% in the first each quarter of the first three of the year and more like 10% in Q4 is just a good rule of thumb. I don't have - I'm not going to give you the exact percentages, but that's a good kind of benchmark for us. As it relates to volume commitments and did - our willingness to honor those commitments relative to this demand environment compared to a customer's willingness to honor a commitment maybe when times are changing. I think we're - we felt confident that we needed to do a minimum expectation, because at the end of the day well, our commitment to the customer - we would like for the customer to have an equal commitment to us, but they're are the customer. I mean we're going to have to - we have to earn their business every day. We have to continue to provide capacity and serve those customers in the way that we set up our plan to do. And we felt like right now in this very, very difficult time for us to take capacity away and do something different with it would have been a challenge that was just extremely difficult to overcome. So I know, Shelley, may want to have a comment or two about the customers relevant to that, and I'll let her comment at this point.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Darren. So - and that we took a similar approach that we have in our past, if you looked at our 2017 and 2018 cycle, which was very similar albeit this time has a lot more disruption about it. We did stick with our customers throughout that cycle and then started having conversations, so that they could plan for it, do appropriate budgeting, and I think that was prudent on our part and our customers part. And in the end, we were able to grow with our customers at appropriate margins. We've recognized that we have more cyclicality happening right now over the last four years or so. Usually the market swings about every five or six years. In this case, it swung twice now in this five-year period. We believe sticking to our commitments and walking our customers through it, we are so focused right now on making sure we help our customers through this very difficult time. That's why we're unleashing every lever we have internally in every piece of capacity that we have and making sure that we don't just fulfill our commitments, but also help them through this very difficult time.\nAmit Mehrotra: Right and this debt?\nNick Hobbs: I was going to jump in and say, we have the same customers and dedicated a lot of them that they haven\u2019t got their business units. And I clearly feel the impact of them being true to their customers, it pays big dividends on our side. We have a very high retention rate, as you see in our business, and that plays across our entire portfolio. So you take care of them in one segment that across all segments are there with you through thick and thin. We've seen that historically.\nAmit Mehrotra: And just one quick follow-up if I could, just going back to what Darren said, in terms of the pricing on the book of business, the puts and takes as you enter the fourth quarter, you have some of the pricing embedded in the book of business. Obviously, the fluidity is still an issue, COVID is still an issue. I assume it gets better. Do margins come down - sorry, do the OR come down as you move 3Q to 4Q? Just talk to us about the puts and takes as you move from 3Q to 4Q?\nDarren Field: Yes, I think that's sort of the question that we all have. We're continuously looking for improvements in our - on our cost front. Without implementing a significant amount of new pricing or some really significant change in our velocity, it's hard for me to see a pathway towards any real material change. Certainly, we think that over the course of the next year, we should be able to see a trend where we're moving back towards our long-term guidance.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So, Darren, I don't know if you have any thoughts on fourth quarter volumes, but if you do that would be great. And then just, as I think about third quarter, I look at IANA volumes that were up 10%. I see BNS intermodal train speeds were up, [indiscernible] were flat. Is this is a rail issue or is there a reason why you're lagging the broader industry in Intermodal right now?\nDarren Field: Well, I understand that BNS train speed is - there hasn't been a lot of challenges in the line of road. When the trains get out of the terminals, they're moving, but terminal congestion is not a part of that velocity measure that you see, and that has been a significant impact on our ability to drive a volume growth. Now, do I think that the IANA data shows significant growth? Yes, and some of that is in the LTL and parcel. So that business today moves - in the past, you would see that more in trailers. Today, a lot of that business has converted to 53-foot containers. So the IANA data doesn't really break out LTL and parcel and container moves, compared to the domestic Intermodal. So I feel like the industry was able to grow faster than J.B. Hunt. I'm not going to argue that. Certainly, we would have expected to maintain our same growth rate, but the congestion in our system, frankly, didn't allow it during the quarter and that's what we've highlighted. And I would expect to get back to where we are growing at a similar pace to the industry in domestic Intermodal, as it relates to all the parcel and LTL growth that the railroads are experiencing. I'm going to leave it to you guys to figure out better ways to see that. Scott, we're turning down. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we think we could have handled 20,000 more loads in the quarter, and that's a - I think that's a soft conservative estimate. We are turning down thousands of loads per week. In some cases, we're turning down Eastern Network growth opportunities, because we have to struggle to find the capacity to serve and honor these commitments we've made. And we feel strongly that over the long term that will absolutely benefit us. It certainly hurt us in the quarter.\nScott Group: And then if I can just ask one for Shelley. So I think in 2017, you were the - I think, the first one that prepared the market for double-digit rate increases in 2018. How are you thinking about the magnitude of pricing? Should it be similar in Intermodal and truckload next year, or is there a reason why one would be up more than the other?\nShelley Simpson: So we did host a conference call with our customers. It's actually a video call. Had about 70% to 80% of our revenue, actually on that call. And we just had open discussion with our business segment presidents along with John Roberts. And really just wanted to give our customers an update in a view of what's happening in the market from a dislocation perspective and a labor challenge issue. We got a lot of questions around that from our customers, really just looking to lean into how they should think about next year. And we just aren't prepared already to have that discussion. We really want to wait through more of peak season and past the election for us to really come to a better consensus on what we believe pricing will do. But having said that, Scott, our cost challenges are real. I think our customers are having cost challenges. Also we do want to have a metered approach and making sure we understand our growth with customers along with cost recovery. And I believe that we'll be talking with our customers towards the end of this year. I really couldn't say what range I feel like that is, because if I gave one, I think, it would be quite off. It could be - I do think it would be up; it could be up significantly or could be more modest. We'll just wait to see what happens, and I would expect to talk to them towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: I wanted to start with a question on Dedicated. It was good to hear about the activity in the pipeline picking up. Nick, when you think about the trucks that have been sold year-to-date, I think you said 890 units. Can you help us think through the cadence of those new business wins coming on board going forward? And then from a start-up cost perspective, what we should be expecting? I'm just curious if margins sequentially should be coming under some pressure because of start-up costs or if there is enough operating leverage from growth to offset that?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. Thanks, Justin. The timing of those, you'll see some of those start up in Q4. Some of them are already starting up right now and some of them will come towards the end of the year, and then there is a pretty good group of them that starts early in Q1. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year is when those that have been sold right now. So it's typically - when we sign on it's typically 90 days to 120 days till you start seeing those trucks on the ground. So anyway, we feel good about that start-up cost. We've got a larger base to cover a lot of that cost. And so you'll see some cost. It's hard to predict, just because drivers are very tight. And so driver wages and recruiting costs are going to be up as we try to find those drivers. So it's pretty hard to predict. But I think you'll see a slight pressure on us from some of those cost.\nJustin Long: So just to be clear, it sounds like margins in Dedicated in the fourth quarter could be down a little bit sequentially versus the third quarter. Is that your expectation?\nJohn Kuhlow: We haven't provided guidance on margins. But I think like Nick suggested, maybe a little bit of startup costs, but there is still pretty good momentum in Dedicated, and guys are executing. So we'll see winter weather can always play a role in cost, but no specific guidance for Dedicated margins other than what we say is long term being 11% to 13%.\nJustin Long: And then, maybe shifting to ICS. Shelley, I was wondering how you're thinking about the level of tech spend and operating expenses in general, going forward. Is the idea that operating expenses can kind of hold with current levels, and you can scale the business to get to profitability in the back half of next year, or how should we be thinking about that operating expense trend in the next 12 months to 18 months?\nShelley Simpson: So from an investment perspective, we really talked about investing in three areas; in our people; in our technology; and in scaling the business. And so, you saw some benefit actually inside the third quarter that's buried in there from some of the efficiencies that we're seeing from our operations group. From 360, we've reinvested some of that into our shipper work, and that has been part of our plan. As we continue to scale through the rest of next year, we believe that our cost base is to stay relatively the same, maybe up just slightly. But if you were to look through this year, we've done a great job really managing our count of people in a very constrained environment, I might add, but our platform has really produced great results for us. I spoke of that earlier in my prepared comments that the platform has reached records and continuing to reach records inside our segment that's allowing us to scale more quickly and that part and invest in the rest of it. So for next year, I would expect our margin improvement for the second half of next year to come as a result of cost as a percent of revenue in both labor and technology to improve as we progress throughout the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Shelley, on the July call, you were the first to kind of flag that gross margins were running at, I think what you call, an unacceptable rate. It seems like gross margins were pretty tough for the entire quarter, but can you just talk about how that trended through 3Q and how that's running in October so far?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, great question. So the third quarter was the exact inverse of what we saw in the second quarter as the brokerage market was really trying to find that balance between supply and demand. So as we looked into July, that was our worst gross margin performance, and we continued to improve as the quarter progressed. And as we've moved here into October, I think our customers have responded well. There is a lot of business that is moving, that is unplanned, that really published pricing would not be appropriate. You saw some of that in our percent of business that's actually in the spot market. But I would say margins in September and October are better than they were in both July and August.\nRavi Shanker: And maybe as a follow up on the Intermodal side, John, can you - do you - I mean, it seems like some of these issues are not going to be resolved overnight. Clearly, investors are focused on the extremely tight truck market and the potential for spillover from truck into Intermodal. Do you feel like the upside opportunity could be restricted somewhat because of these operating issues at the end of 2020 and into 2021?\nJohn Kuhlow: I'm going to have Darren answer that.\nDarren Field: Yes. Well, do I - certainly, we're working with our customers across the board to where we're talking about what we're capable of doing with our Intermodal capacity, and like we've said honoring those commitments. And then when we run out of capacity, and - but we've honored the commitments, they still have more demand. And we're talking as an organization about how we can drive value into the organization and to the customer with the capacity we can find. As it relates to the railroads, I just think - I think all of the railroads want to have ongoing dialog about improving productivity at their terminals. And I think we're engaged in those conversations. Now, it's very difficult to implement significant changes in that area during the course of this really unusual rapid climb in demand that occurred over the course of the summer. As we go into next year, we will be talking about how - what are the ways that we can expand capacity in the rail system without necessarily investing or just buying new terminals. The long-term value for railroads can't just be that they're going to expand and buy more parking in order to accommodate Intermodal growth. We all have to work with our customers, railroads and us together, in order to drive more productivity through those terminals. And I am 100% convinced that railroads want to do that, and that's not going to be something that we have to push for they want to do that. It has been painful in 2020, and yet in the remaining part of this year. Certainly, I don't expect I would be surprised if that really changed in any material way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: You mentioned a little bit about changing sort of how you view jump ball bids, I'd love to get some more color on that, and how that would change across your different units. Is this something where you're going to look to set up contracts more like Dedicated has?\nJohn N. Roberts: Yes, this is John. So we've all been in this business for quite some time, and I have witnessed a great deal of evolution in many areas of - not only what we do, but what the industry does. But one area that really hasn't seemed to change is, frankly for nearly three decades or longer, how we price and a range for the services presented in our Highway and Intermodal business. And we have learned different ways to position that service contractually with some niche kind of approaches that really work. And if you think about the nature of the equipment that we need to procure to service customers, the life cycle of those equipments and those contracts that we need to arrange with railroad providers and other carriers, it's out of sync with the way we do business with our customers. And we studied - in fact, Darren and I just had a really good conversation about this last week that historically, there is no real value to the customer in that constant annual event that really takes a lot of time. Does it really present a lot of value? And if we work more collaboratively with agreements that were more logically aligned with the services and the equipment we were providing, I think everybody will have better understanding for our networks. We'd have appreciation for how to buy the equipment. I think it probably do good for our labor and our drivers, our utilization, all the things that go into really what we learn in Dedicated, which is, an engineer would answer not, I don't suggest that we could apply all of the logic that we've learned from our DCS business. But there is a much better way to arrange these contracts to where, particularly our larger shippers who need this year in and year out, frankly, could be set up to advantage both us, our providers and our customers, and I've seen it already happened. And in some cases, we're in the middle of that, and we are all benefiting from it. And so my encouragement to the organization and to our customers is, consider changing the way we do business in this one way world to a more thoughtful and frankly logical approach. And I'm going to be pushing forward.\nJason Seidl: And that's something I'm assuming will take years to sort of move over customer contracts like that?\nJohn N. Roberts: Most likely, but you got to start somewhere.\nJason Seidl: Yes. And, I'm...\nShelley Simpson: If I...\nJason Seidl: Go ahead please, Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Just wanted to add to that, our customers are really asking us to grow across all of our segments. That's something we're seeing great success in, and we believe that that will be for longer-term from a growth perspective. And so when we think about how we plan, we don't just plan with ourselves, we also plan with the railroad providers. And the more information we can give them and the more understanding we can give them about the customers that are really secured and locked in a lane level, the better that we can do together to make sure that we have great capacity across the board. So I feel like doing a one-year bid is very difficult for us to walk our railroad providers. Certainly, what we need from a driver perspective it\u2019s like we're short-term planning in a tactical environment versus really focusing on a better long-term strategic answer.\nJason Seidl: No. That makes all the sense of the world, and let me throw really one quick one. And you mentioned growing the trailers on Highway Services, is this because you need them with catch-up business, or is there something changing in how the supply chain is working that requires you to own more trailers going forward?\nShelley Simpson: Well, one of the things that we've heard from our customers as we have introduced 360 Marketplace is, for the most part that has been for our brokerage segment and that's how the business started. But if you look at the truckload industry, about half of the business actually requires more capital from a trailing perspective. And so if you think about the capacity that is available in the market, 83% of the capacity available is in the small carrier community with 10 or less trucks. So moving into the Marketplace now, we've actually blended both the drop-trailer environment with the live-load environment, creating one network instead of two, and our customers are loving that product. So we've leaned in with our customers early in bid season. It's one of the reasons our growth really started out strong this year. We continue to have customers ask us how many boxes we will move. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we're moving to a more asset-light answer, and so we do have a great blend of company truck and independent contractors, and even brokering some of that business all sitting inside the platform. So I think the market is large and the ability to create a better, more efficient network exists significantly, and putting 360 box or our drop trailers in that network just makes sense from a capacity perspective for our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: I understand the reluctance maybe to give some near-term guidance on Dedicated margins, but Nick, it sounds like that in your comments you said that margin should kind of get back to the 11% to 13% range longer term. But it's been close to seven quarters where you've been above that range. Is there a reason why structurally the margin profile of that business can't be higher, especially in an environment maybe where travel and entertainment isn't what it was historically? So just give a thought on why you can't continue to run at this range even if you do see some of the expenses normalize longer term?\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I think the way we look at our deals we price each one of our deals based on a set targeted return on invested capital. And so, if we get some deals that are little lighter on assets, the customer has their own trailers, each deal is priced differently. And so I'm just trying to look at the long range, and we don't know which mix of heavy assets, light assets are going to come in. So we think long term that's still the guidance that we're very comfortable with based on deals that we see in the pipeline and so forth. Just based on pure ROIC.\nBrad Delco: Yes, Todd. Hi, this is Brad. And maybe I have to say it a little bit - to say that a little bit differently is, I think regardless of what happens over time, the way that Dedicated will approach pricing deals is always focusing on return on invested capital. And to the extent as Nick alluded to, some of the deals are more capital intensive. Yes, that could push margins higher in order to achieve the same targeted return on invested capital. And so that, to the extent there is changes in margin that could be a big driver of that change. But I think, more importantly, what will not change is how we initially approach those deals, which is the focus on those returns.\nTodd Fowler: And so, I think what's may be difficult for us to see is a little bit of the mix of the deals that are coming through the asset intensity versus the asset light, and that's just something that - it's difficult to kind of tease out of the numbers the way they're reported it sounds like. And just for my follow-up Nick, I guess maybe sticking with you, with the growth that you're seeing right now in Final Mile and kind of the trends that you talked about? Can you talk about the platform that you have in place to support the growth that you're seeing both near term and kind of what you expect longer term? As you think about that business continuing to grow, is that something that is all organic at this point and require just more infrastructure or is that something that you'd look to do more acquisitions and how do we think about the cost that would be associated with facilitating what looks like in some pretty decent growth in that segment?\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I would just say the existing business that we're running today, not a lot of infrastructure cost of facilities or anything like that. A lot of the new deals that we're doing is running out of customers' locations, doing home deliveries. So we don't see any big capital expense going in on infrastructure, anything like that. And so, we feel good about continued growth. Acquisitions, we always look, but as those come in, the right deals approaches we'll look at them. But there is a big runway just on organic growth right now from what we're seeing with five or six of our largest customers. We're just a small percentage of their business, and they're rolling out their networks, and we're kind of riding along on their coattails.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the jump ball comment and a couple of prior questions on that. Just - the evolution - if you guys were able to move to what do you think would be optimal for the industry and in a way that your customers would agree to? Is this - is it more of a cost-plus type longer term commitment that you have in mind that accounts for the capital intensity of that customer? Is it setting some revenue or volume floors that would also protects you in down markets? I just want to understand more tactically what a new world could look like in Intermodal pricing that you think would have a win-win sort of set up for both you and your customers? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Yes, thanks Bascome. I\u2019ll start and then ask Shelley or Darren or anybody else to come in. I think you hit on a lot of ideas that we have explored and had - have had success with in the past with different customers. One of the things we implemented some time ago in Dedicated was kind of an index-based pricing strategy, where we have a way to recognize labor cost and other inflationary pressures that are visible and easy to process. And recognize and apply to our pricing in a way that doesn't require all the activity we present in a bid work out, and we spend that time working on the business. We have a program, we call Customer Value Delivery, where we identify metrics, key performance indicators that keep us on track with service and performance, all those things can be tied together so that the energy is on the service, not the one way as we call it jump ball pricing. I think volume and different levels of either lane or total commitment can be helpful to - as Shelley said, provide the really needed guidance that we would want to present, i.e. to our rail providers to say hey, this is what we've got on the book. And if you look at Nick's business - and Nick, what's our retention now? It still 90.\nNick Hobbs: It's 97% and some change.\nJohn Roberts: High 90s, so we know what's happening in that business year in and year out, and can really plan for that. And I think the reason that we have such high retention is because we do a really good job for the customer while else would they stay with us. And so that's - the idea here is can we apply some of that logic. We've had some experimentation with this. We've seen it work. We do think it's better for the customer. I mean, it's not just better for us, it's actually really better for the customer, and we've frankly made a living prioritizing that need. Let me see if Shelley or Darren want to add anything to that?\nShelley Simpson: Bascome, I would say our customers really want a prediction for their budgeting. And I think our ability to give them that prediction, in particular from an asset perspective, largely comes down to how long we can do business together. Because in our cost basis to that, you think about bid season, we're able to actually fill in gaps to bill in lanes that are embedded in our price the longer that we have the business together. I do not think that our customers are interested in, nor do I think it's good for us to do cost plus on all of our business that does not leave a predictable budget to a customer, and I don't think that's a good business model. However, I believe in the bid process that the business that should be in there would be business that is static and regular and that business can be published and predicted for a customer, that business also could go into a longer-term agreement. But there is a lot of business that moves in a more dynamic nature, and that business is still and old, trying to go up against a published price that really is not commensurate to the market at every time and that's what causes so many issues in the market. And as we're talking to our customers about that whether that's in Intermodal or any of our Highway Services area as our customers have lanes and loads that are unpredictable. And we can't get into a repeating pattern that business really needs to match up directly with capacity in the moment, and we have found that over a longer period that actually is better for customers. That is a factual number that we've assigned to that internally to say we actually could save our customers more money if we were able to do that for them and improve their service and capacity.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for the thoughtful answer.\nBrad Delco: And Stephanie, we'll do one more quick question before we hang it up.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes, thanks everyone. Nick, I just want to talk a little bit about the FMS segment, and we've seen nice growth there, a slight turn in profitability, but obviously not where you want it? What's the biggest obstacle of getting the margin either in line with Dedicated or where you want them? Because I know they're not going to be in line with Dedicated, because it's more asset light, but how do you get from here to there?\nNick Hobbs: Yes it's a very, very fragmented industry, and so I try to look at it and take the same approach in Dedicated. You gave a customer fantastic service, and great people that's executing that service then you'll be able to go in and get the appropriate returns that you need on rates as the contracts come up. And so, it's just a very methodical approach of executing, being best-in-class on service, taking care of our customers' customers. And then over time, you will be able to improve the margins to an acceptable rate of return. And we are methodically going down that path right now, trying to execute that. But it is a very fragmented industry, and so you have to be very careful because there's a lot of small - the barriers to entry right now is pretty low. But we think with a lot of our background checks, safety and security and things that we do. We're going to set the bar higher to come into the industry, and then we'll be able to get a higher price on our product and a better return.\nDavid Ross: And are you seeing much consolidation yet in the industry or is it those fragmented than levers?\nNick Hobbs: No, there is some consolidation coming in. There is four or five folks that's starting to do some acquisitions. So it is seeing some consolidation, but it's still a slow process.\nDavid Ross: Excellent, thank you.\nBrad Delco: Hi, thanks everybody for the time. We will be in touch with you during the quarter in a couple conferences, or if not we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thanks John, and good morning, everyone joining us on the call today. I'll provide a couple of quick comments on the third quarter from a consolidated perspective, and then let the business unit leaders cover their segments. The most prevalent cost impacts in the quarter were driven by the disruption in our networks due to congestion and capacity tightness from labor challenges. We saw other direct costs related to the pandemic begin to moderate during the quarter. We continue to offer paid time off for our employees that have quarantined, as well as invest heavily and caring for our employees through protective equipment and workstation enhancements as we return to office. We incurred approximately $4 million of specific costs in the quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic for a total of $29 million year-to-date. We performed well in repositioning and redeploying our people and assets as effectively as possible to avoid furloughs and layoffs, which was the right call given the labor challenges noted. We continue to carefully review our spend, balancing the need to invest for the long term, but being mindful of our current environment and resource needs. Regarding the management of accounts receivable, we are pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to handle payment issues, and we saw customer loss reserves return to pre-pandemic levels during the third quarter. We continue to closely monitor our working capital metrics and the change in credit landscape. As we've communicated throughout the year, our long-term approach to capital management has not changed. However, like the second quarter and given the uncertainty in the freight markets and the pandemic, we made intentional adjustments to our approach for the sake of protecting liquidity. While still confident in our balance sheet strength and investment-grade status, we maintained higher cash positions through the third quarter as we felt it prudent given uncertainty in market liquidity. Accordingly, we ended the quarter with approximately $320 million in cash, with the resulting net debt just under $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at 1 times EBITDA and anticipate staying within close range of that metric. As of today, we're forecasting our full-year 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million to $625 million, which includes revenue equipment as well as approximately $100 million of technology investment in our core transportation management system. Overall, we're pleased with our balance sheet strength and feel we are in a great position to invest in our long-term asset and technology plans. That's all I had prepared, and I will now turn it over to Nick Hobbs to expand on Dedicated and Final Mile. We haven't provided guidance on margins. But I think like Nick suggested, maybe a little bit of startup costs, but there is still pretty good momentum in Dedicated, and guys are executing. So we'll see winter weather can always play a role in cost, but no specific guidance for Dedicated margins other than what we say is long term being 11% to 13%. I'm going to have Darren answer that."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to spend my time this morning discussing the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile segments. I'll also provide some updates on our pipeline and give some high level expectations for these businesses in the future. I'll start with Dedicated or DCS. DCS had another solid quarter highlighted by strong executional performance that delivered a 5% improvement in operating income year-over-year on roughly a similar tractor fleet. In addition, strong utilization of our assets, the benefits of greater density in [0:15:39.6] our operating region, performance was also driven by lower driver turnover, lower T&E expense versus the prior year, and less customer start-up cost. As we stated last quarter, we expected new contract wins to be offset by some attrition at accounts, given all the unique challenges, the current environment and the pandemic that has presented us a broad and diverse portfolio of customers. And that would ultimately keep our truck fleet account stable for the remainder of the year. While that is still the case, we are feeling a lot better about the pipeline, which I will address next. As of September 30th, we have sold 890 trucks worth of new dedicated business year-to-date, which compares to 430 trucks sold as of our last quarter. As a reminder, we had previously expected to sell 600 to 800 trucks worth of new business this year, and I am proud to have achieved this goal a quarter early. We have seen a meaningful uptick in conversations and conversion of opportunities to sign contracts over the last three months. Customer challenges, including lack of available drivers, our insurance cost, the desire of companies to allocate capital to their core businesses, in addition to some of the flexibilities offered by professionally outsourced dedicated fleet solution, are all driving greater demand for our services. Our service and ability to adapt to customer needs throughout the pandemic has served as a testament to the value we bring, which we believe is evidenced by this positive update on our pipeline. Looking out, we continue to target 11% to 13% operating margins over the long term, as customers' start-up cost, higher driver wages, recruiting cost, and travel and entertainment expenses normalize. Now shifting gears to Final Mile or FMS. FMS was able to deliver all-time record revenue of $182 million in the quarter or 22% growth versus the year-ago period and return to slight profitability as we predicted last quarter. We are seeing strength across our portfolio in the furniture, appliance and pool distribution business, with ample opportunities for growth in new market segments, like home exercise equipment and home improvement. To put it bluntly, the pipeline of opportunities is as strong as I've ever seen it. As a result, we are continuing to invest in our product and service offering to ensure the high standards of service, safety and satisfaction are met in this critical component of the supply chain, as we deliver products of our customer's customer. Looking out, we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities in this rapidly growing channel. That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Shelley. I was going to jump in and say, we have the same customers and dedicated a lot of them that they haven't got their business units. And I clearly feel the impact of them being true to their customers, it pays big dividends on our side. We have a very high retention rate, as you see in our business, and that plays across our entire portfolio. So you take care of them in one segment that across all segments are there with you through thick and thin. We've seen that historically. Yes. Thanks, Justin. The timing of those, you'll see some of those start up in Q4. Some of them are already starting up right now and some of them will come towards the end of the year, and then there is a pretty good group of them that starts early in Q1. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year is when those that have been sold right now. So it's typically - when we sign on it's typically 90 days to 120 days till you start seeing those trucks on the ground. So anyway, we feel good about that start-up cost. We've got a larger base to cover a lot of that cost. And so you'll see some cost. It's hard to predict, just because drivers are very tight. And so driver wages and recruiting costs are going to be up as we try to find those drivers. So it's pretty hard to predict. But I think you'll see a slight pressure on us from some of those cost. Yes, I think the way we look at our deals we price each one of our deals based on a set targeted return on invested capital. And so, if we get some deals that are little lighter on assets, the customer has their own trailers, each deal is priced differently. And so I'm just trying to look at the long range, and we don't know which mix of heavy assets, light assets are going to come in. So we think long term that's still the guidance that we're very comfortable with based on deals that we see in the pipeline and so forth. Just based on pure ROIC. Yes, I would just say the existing business that we're running today, not a lot of infrastructure cost of facilities or anything like that. A lot of the new deals that we're doing is running out of customers' locations, doing home deliveries. So we don't see any big capital expense going in on infrastructure, anything like that. And so, we feel good about continued growth. Acquisitions, we always look, but as those come in, the right deals approaches we'll look at them. But there is a big runway just on organic growth right now from what we're seeing with five or six of our largest customers. We're just a small percentage of their business, and they're rolling out their networks, and we're kind of riding along on their coattails. It's 97% and some change. Yes it's a very, very fragmented industry, and so I try to look at it and take the same approach in Dedicated. You gave a customer fantastic service, and great people that's executing that service then you'll be able to go in and get the appropriate returns that you need on rates as the contracts come up. And so, it's just a very methodical approach of executing, being best-in-class on service, taking care of our customers' customers. And then over time, you will be able to improve the margins to an acceptable rate of return. And we are methodically going down that path right now, trying to execute that. But it is a very fragmented industry, and so you have to be very careful because there's a lot of small - the barriers to entry right now is pretty low. But we think with a lot of our background checks, safety and security and things that we do. We're going to set the bar higher to come into the industry, and then we'll be able to get a higher price on our product and a better return. No, there is some consolidation coming in. There is four or five folks that's starting to do some acquisitions. So it is seeing some consolidation, but it's still a slow process."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Today, my comments will focus on our performance in Highway Services, which includes both ICS and Truck, how we continue to respond to complex challenges on behalf of our customers, and an update on our investments in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, as well as 360 box. First I'm extremely proud of the progress the team in both ICS and JBT made in the quarter on many strategic and operational front, as we and the industry continue to face unique challenges. ICS was able to deliver a record $431 million in revenue in the quarter, a 28% increase year-over-year and a 42% increase versus the second quarter. More encouraging is ICS' ability to capitalize on this growth despite only a 5.5% increase in operating costs in this segment, highlighting the benefits of scale and leveraging the build out of our platform. JBT delivered 16% revenue growth versus the prior period, despite a 7% decline in average truck count, as JBT continues to evolve into a more of an asset-light service offering, with the continued rollout in investment in 360 box. As a result, third-party capacity providers have tremendous visibility to select power-only loads, calling our trailers, utilizing our 360 box trailer pool. We continue to see promising data across both ICS and JBT, related to our customer activity and engagement and our ability to scale the model to grow to meet the needs of our customers. Next, I'm also extremely encouraged by our team's ability to help customers solve for their capacity challenges by providing solutions, tailor to what fit the customers' unique needs. The marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 provides the platform to serve whatever customer wants whether that is a J.B. Hunt asset or a third party carrier solution, committed or spot capacity or guaranteed tender acceptance, and at the service levels that beat industry standards, whether the alternative is an asset or non-asset solution. In addition, we provide tremendous visibility with data and market analytics to help our customers to make informed decisions that will save them money through greater efficiencies. All of J.B. Hunt segments have visibility into the platform as well with the ability to leverage opportunities to drive efficiencies with our own assets. As you will hear from Darren, this helps us serve customers and meet our commitments when circumstances might not otherwise allow. It's a comprehensive approach to being able to the best of our ability to tell our customers yet, when we or others might otherwise say no. We will continue to focus on partnering with customers that see the value of our comprehensive team approach with our goal to build raising tend. In closing, our investments remain focused on our people, technology and scaling the platform, and we continue to be on track with our long-term plan. As we stated in our last call, scaling the platform is one of the greatest risk and opportunities to achieving our long-term target, and our recent performance is even more encouraged. In the third quarter, 360 saw truckload volume growth of 22%, an all-time records in the number of carriers, users and loads on the platform. In JBT, we are and will continue to make investments, albeit on a smaller scale, in building out our 360 box program. We see that business continuing to evolve into a more asset-light blend of trailers, third-party carriers, with some blend of company trucks and being complementary value-added service offering to our customers. I'd now like to turn it over to Darren to talk about Intermodal. Well, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are encouraged with the growth we are experiencing and also the appetite that our customers have to really be interested in doing business differently. John talked about that in his opening comments that the jump ball scenario we believe could be something different and we are pushing inside 360 to deliver that on behalf of our customers. Having said that, we have more confidence and as we progress through the quarter and into the fourth quarter that our comments around the second half of next year remain intact and that we should return to profitability by sometime next year second half. Thank you, Darren. So - and that we took a similar approach that we have in our past, if you looked at our 2017 and 2018 cycle, which was very similar albeit this time has a lot more disruption about it. We did stick with our customers throughout that cycle and then started having conversations, so that they could plan for it, do appropriate budgeting, and I think that was prudent on our part and our customers part. And in the end, we were able to grow with our customers at appropriate margins. We've recognized that we have more cyclicality happening right now over the last four years or so. Usually the market swings about every five or six years. In this case, it swung twice now in this five-year period. We believe sticking to our commitments and walking our customers through it, we are so focused right now on making sure we help our customers through this very difficult time. That's why we're unleashing every lever we have internally in every piece of capacity that we have and making sure that we don't just fulfill our commitments, but also help them through this very difficult time. So we did host a conference call with our customers. It's actually a video call. Had about 70% to 80% of our revenue, actually on that call. And we just had open discussion with our business segment presidents along with John Roberts. And really just wanted to give our customers an update in a view of what's happening in the market from a dislocation perspective and a labor challenge issue. We got a lot of questions around that from our customers, really just looking to lean into how they should think about next year. And we just aren't prepared already to have that discussion. We really want to wait through more of peak season and past the election for us to really come to a better consensus on what we believe pricing will do. But having said that, Scott, our cost challenges are real. I think our customers are having cost challenges. Also we do want to have a metered approach and making sure we understand our growth with customers along with cost recovery. And I believe that we'll be talking with our customers towards the end of this year. I really couldn't say what range I feel like that is, because if I gave one, I think, it would be quite off. It could be - I do think it would be up; it could be up significantly or could be more modest. We'll just wait to see what happens, and I would expect to talk to them towards the end of the year. So from an investment perspective, we really talked about investing in three areas; in our people; in our technology; and in scaling the business. And so, you saw some benefit actually inside the third quarter that's buried in there from some of the efficiencies that we're seeing from our operations group. From 360, we've reinvested some of that into our shipper work, and that has been part of our plan. As we continue to scale through the rest of next year, we believe that our cost base is to stay relatively the same, maybe up just slightly. But if you were to look through this year, we've done a great job really managing our count of people in a very constrained environment, I might add, but our platform has really produced great results for us. I spoke of that earlier in my prepared comments that the platform has reached records and continuing to reach records inside our segment that's allowing us to scale more quickly and that part and invest in the rest of it. So for next year, I would expect our margin improvement for the second half of next year to come as a result of cost as a percent of revenue in both labor and technology to improve as we progress throughout the year. Yes, great question. So the third quarter was the exact inverse of what we saw in the second quarter as the brokerage market was really trying to find that balance between supply and demand. So as we looked into July, that was our worst gross margin performance, and we continued to improve as the quarter progressed. And as we've moved here into October, I think our customers have responded well. There is a lot of business that is moving, that is unplanned, that really published pricing would not be appropriate. You saw some of that in our percent of business that's actually in the spot market. But I would say margins in September and October are better than they were in both July and August. If I... Just wanted to add to that, our customers are really asking us to grow across all of our segments. That's something we're seeing great success in, and we believe that that will be for longer-term from a growth perspective. And so when we think about how we plan, we don't just plan with ourselves, we also plan with the railroad providers. And the more information we can give them and the more understanding we can give them about the customers that are really secured and locked in a lane level, the better that we can do together to make sure that we have great capacity across the board. So I feel like doing a one-year bid is very difficult for us to walk our railroad providers. Certainly, what we need from a driver perspective it's like we're short-term planning in a tactical environment versus really focusing on a better long-term strategic answer. Well, one of the things that we've heard from our customers as we have introduced 360 Marketplace is, for the most part that has been for our brokerage segment and that's how the business started. But if you look at the truckload industry, about half of the business actually requires more capital from a trailing perspective. And so if you think about the capacity that is available in the market, 83% of the capacity available is in the small carrier community with 10 or less trucks. So moving into the Marketplace now, we've actually blended both the drop-trailer environment with the live-load environment, creating one network instead of two, and our customers are loving that product. So we've leaned in with our customers early in bid season. It's one of the reasons our growth really started out strong this year. We continue to have customers ask us how many boxes we will move. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we're moving to a more asset-light answer, and so we do have a great blend of company truck and independent contractors, and even brokering some of that business all sitting inside the platform. So I think the market is large and the ability to create a better, more efficient network exists significantly, and putting 360 box or our drop trailers in that network just makes sense from a capacity perspective for our customers. Bascome, I would say our customers really want a prediction for their budgeting. And I think our ability to give them that prediction, in particular from an asset perspective, largely comes down to how long we can do business together. Because in our cost basis to that, you think about bid season, we're able to actually fill in gaps to bill in lanes that are embedded in our price the longer that we have the business together. I do not think that our customers are interested in, nor do I think it's good for us to do cost plus on all of our business that does not leave a predictable budget to a customer, and I don't think that's a good business model. However, I believe in the bid process that the business that should be in there would be business that is static and regular and that business can be published and predicted for a customer, that business also could go into a longer-term agreement. But there is a lot of business that moves in a more dynamic nature, and that business is still and old, trying to go up against a published price that really is not commensurate to the market at every time and that's what causes so many issues in the market. And as we're talking to our customers about that whether that's in Intermodal or any of our Highway Services area as our customers have lanes and loads that are unpredictable. And we can't get into a repeating pattern that business really needs to match up directly with capacity in the moment, and we have found that over a longer period that actually is better for customers. That is a factual number that we've assigned to that internally to say we actually could save our customers more money if we were able to do that for them and improve their service and capacity."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. Today, I wanted to focus my comments on three key topics; network performance, the current demand in pricing environment and some general thoughts around how we begin to move forward from here. First, I continue to be encouraged with our team's relentless effort to solve capacity challenges for our customers, despite what I view as the most difficult environment from a network balance and fluidity perspective I have seen during my career. Rail terminal congestion and a slower pace of unloading at customer destinations have contributed to a meaningful slowdown in the velocity of the supply chain and thus the productivity of our equipment. The primary theme across both of these challenges is centered around labor shortages. Our rail providers are working through labor shortages at some key rail terminal operations, while we are confident that they will get back to their productivity targets, which negatively impacted the quarter. Also, our customers have also been challenged with labor at the warehouses, and the time it takes to unload our equipment has increased meaningfully year-over-year, impacting our overall equipment productivity and otherwise available capacity we can provide to the market. At JBI, we have also experienced cost challenges related to availability of labor given the tight and extremely difficult driver market, which negatively impacted margins in the quarter. We are making progress on the driver front, but the driver shortage remains a challenge for the industry. We certainly expect some improvements in all of these areas moving forward, but we don't yet know if we can achieve even last year's velocity in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, volume demand was extremely strong. The challenges from weaker velocity began to impact us in late July and continued throughout the quarter. Volume growth in July was 6%, August was flat, and September grew 2%. Across the board, our customers have asked us to provide more capacity. Our ability to flow empty equipment back to the West Coast to support the eastbound demand was limited during the quarter due to the Velocity challenges previously mentioned, which we estimate prevented us from completing as many as 20,000 more loads in the quarter. Many of you may want to ask if we were able to yield and manage our capacity during the quarter in an effort to chase higher prices. At J.B. Hunt, we communicated two priorities as the pandemic began. Number 1, the health and well-being of our employees; and two, to honor commitments we made to our customers. We believe a business it takes care of its people and honors its commitments to customers, particularly in challenging times, is a recipe for long-term sustainable growth. With that in mind, all of our capacity has been consumed with meaning minimum commitments during this difficult capacity constrained environment. On a positive note, we have worked closely with both ICS, JBT and DCS to provide additional capacity solutions for our customers, while we continue to focus on work -- our work to improve velocity in our network. We believe that working collectively to provide solutions for our customers provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. As we move forward into Q4 and 2021, we don't see anything changing on the demand front. We continue to make small steps of progress on the velocity front. At this stage of the peak season shipping cycle, we expect the velocity challenges experienced in Q3 to continue in Q4 with small improvements in all the areas. The pricing bid cycles for 2021 is just beginning. Certainly, we would expect a lot of discussion with our customers regarding capacity planning and cost management. We are prepared to expand our container fleet for growth, but we will need to balance appropriate targeted returns on our investments to do so, and we will engage with all of our customers with that thought in mind. In closing my prepared comments, I want to say that we're not satisfied with these results in our volume trends, margin performance or equipment utilization. We are not changing our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%, and we continue to believe we have a pathway to improvements in this area. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back to you, Brad. Well I would say, and frankly in July, we had a slightly better fluidity in the system. As we got into the back half, really August, throughout the quarter, we have continued to really struggle with the velocity of the equipment. So July had 6% growth, as we highlighted over the previous July of 2019. As we went throughout the quarter though, velocity of the equipment and our ability to relocate empties has remained very challenging, and so far in October that challenge continues. Yes, as we get into the bid cycle, we're talking about that very challenge with our customers. I think we've - you've heard that theme from our comments so far, as we've - we've got to find a way to deal with that a little bit differently than what we've done in the past. So, the reality is we need time to implement new prices. Certainly, we need the rail system congestion to be relieved somewhat. I don't really expect that to happen in Q4. And as we move into 2021 clearly, I would expect some congestion challenges to relieve a little bit in the first quarter that would be normal, but nothing about 2020 has been normal so far. So we'll have to wait and see. But certainly, new pricing, which would also help to cover some of our cost challenges, is not likely to be visible until Q2 or even Q3 of next year. And that's when we would get the bulk of the business repriced as we go through the bid cycle. Well, I don't know that we're ready to provide any kind of guidance on volume, but like I said, I don't really anticipate velocity changes to be beneficial during Q4. And so, it's difficult to think that we would have any kind of material benefit coming in Q4. Well, from an implementation standpoint, I think what you're hearing is we do want to engage with customers and trying to rethink how we typically do this. It's - the jump ball is difficult, and in fast changing times around us, it really gets amplified in terms of how harsh it can be on us. And probably, maybe some customers feel the same way if it's move in the other direction. But historically, we would implement new prices on the smallest percentage of our business during Q4. So call it 10% to 15% of the business. It's a new price on it. Implemented and running through the system during the quarter. Q1 would be more like 25% to 30%, and the same for Q2 and Q3. So if you just kind of break it into, maybe call it, 30% in the first each quarter of the first three of the year and more like 10% in Q4 is just a good rule of thumb. I don't have - I'm not going to give you the exact percentages, but that's a good kind of benchmark for us. As it relates to volume commitments and did - our willingness to honor those commitments relative to this demand environment compared to a customer's willingness to honor a commitment maybe when times are changing. I think we're - we felt confident that we needed to do a minimum expectation, because at the end of the day well, our commitment to the customer - we would like for the customer to have an equal commitment to us, but they're are the customer. I mean we're going to have to - we have to earn their business every day. We have to continue to provide capacity and serve those customers in the way that we set up our plan to do. And we felt like right now in this very, very difficult time for us to take capacity away and do something different with it would have been a challenge that was just extremely difficult to overcome. So I know, Shelley, may want to have a comment or two about the customers relevant to that, and I'll let her comment at this point. Yes, I think that's sort of the question that we all have. We're continuously looking for improvements in our - on our cost front. Without implementing a significant amount of new pricing or some really significant change in our velocity, it's hard for me to see a pathway towards any real material change. Certainly, we think that over the course of the next year, we should be able to see a trend where we're moving back towards our long-term guidance. Well, I understand that BNS train speed is - there hasn't been a lot of challenges in the line of road. When the trains get out of the terminals, they're moving, but terminal congestion is not a part of that velocity measure that you see, and that has been a significant impact on our ability to drive a volume growth. Now, do I think that the IANA data shows significant growth? Yes, and some of that is in the LTL and parcel. So that business today moves - in the past, you would see that more in trailers. Today, a lot of that business has converted to 53-foot containers. So the IANA data doesn't really break out LTL and parcel and container moves, compared to the domestic Intermodal. So I feel like the industry was able to grow faster than J.B. Hunt. I'm not going to argue that. Certainly, we would have expected to maintain our same growth rate, but the congestion in our system, frankly, didn't allow it during the quarter and that's what we've highlighted. And I would expect to get back to where we are growing at a similar pace to the industry in domestic Intermodal, as it relates to all the parcel and LTL growth that the railroads are experiencing. I'm going to leave it to you guys to figure out better ways to see that. Scott, we're turning down. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we think we could have handled 20,000 more loads in the quarter, and that's a - I think that's a soft conservative estimate. We are turning down thousands of loads per week. In some cases, we're turning down Eastern Network growth opportunities, because we have to struggle to find the capacity to serve and honor these commitments we've made. And we feel strongly that over the long term that will absolutely benefit us. It certainly hurt us in the quarter. Yes. Well, do I - certainly, we're working with our customers across the board to where we're talking about what we're capable of doing with our Intermodal capacity, and like we've said honoring those commitments. And then when we run out of capacity, and - but we've honored the commitments, they still have more demand. And we're talking as an organization about how we can drive value into the organization and to the customer with the capacity we can find. As it relates to the railroads, I just think - I think all of the railroads want to have ongoing dialog about improving productivity at their terminals. And I think we're engaged in those conversations. Now, it's very difficult to implement significant changes in that area during the course of this really unusual rapid climb in demand that occurred over the course of the summer. As we go into next year, we will be talking about how - what are the ways that we can expand capacity in the rail system without necessarily investing or just buying new terminals. The long-term value for railroads can't just be that they're going to expand and buy more parking in order to accommodate Intermodal growth. We all have to work with our customers, railroads and us together, in order to drive more productivity through those terminals. And I am 100% convinced that railroads want to do that, and that's not going to be something that we have to push for they want to do that. It has been painful in 2020, and yet in the remaining part of this year. Certainly, I don't expect I would be surprised if that really changed in any material way."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. Well, we are all learning to live with the changes that have been presented by the virus. When we began in mid-March, the response to a very sudden change in how we do business was incredible. From day one, we had to pivot to a new normal on the go and we are so proud of our teams across the country for the different ways we have found to make it work. As noted, we set out our priorities to deal with the situation clearly and from the start, take care of the health and safety of our people and work hard to honor the commitments we have made to our customers. Initially, the adrenalin pushed us through, but over time, we start to see while we work together in person, the benefits of being together and collaborating, building on our culture, solving problems as a team and sharing time with each other showed their value to us more now than ever. This reality is profit good work to find ways to begin coming back together, particularly in our corporate offices very slowly and very carefully. We should also call out that due to the nature of the business, 75% of our people in the field have been effectively in position since day one of the crisis, our drivers and so many of the people that support them. We are extremely grateful to all of our employees, both at corporate and in the field and thank them for their commitment. The third quarter showed us some new opportunities and spiking customer demands across all businesses that I don't recall seeing in the past. At different points, we regrettably had to turn away business that was offered but not built into our original network plans and commitments. The supply side of the equation, our carriers and our rail providers all experienced pressure and congestion during the quarter. Also due to what we believe is a labor shortage at our customers causing unloading delays, we have not been able to turn our trailing equipment, as well as we have been able to in the past. Topping off the list is an abnormally high demand to higher company drivers for both replacement and growth. Currently, we are entering the typical annual bid cycles with more uncertainty about capacity and demand. We are actively discussing directional ideas for the next 12 months to 18 months internally and with our customers, including support for fleet expansion in the Intermodal and Highway Services trailing equipment. ROIC has long been our guiding principle when it comes to determining where to allocate capital. We ask ourselves, what does the customer need and can we generate a proper return on the investments to serve those needs? How can we advance the agreements and relationships we have with customers to better align our deal cycles with our equipment cycles? Personally, I think annual jump ball bids are dated and not good for the customers. We can't jump ball our equipment every year. Encouragingly, we have seen some progress in modernizing the business models in Intermodal and Highway Services. We hope that will continue. I will ask our business leaders to cover the segments. For the overall current state of our business, let me just say that I continue to be encouraged with the work being done in our digital transformation with 360 marketplace, not only within our brokerage business but also as a tool set for us to use with other asset and non-asset services. I'm also encouraged with the progress so far in developing our big and bulky Final Mile Services. This includes the performance of our acquisitions before COVID and also the organic growth we have experienced. Both of these key plays recalls to help the Company evolve several years ago, and as with any difficult business we need time to reveal the progress. We will continue to lean into both of these channels going forward. Our more established lines, Intermodal and Dedicated, give us a solid base to work from, and we believe that both of these businesses present sound growth and return profiles going forward. Let me close by saying that during the past eight months, I have witnessed the true test of what I have had long believed to be a culture at J.B. Hunt that is centered on people, a commitment to each other and our duty to serve our customers. We see that duty as a privilege and know that we need each other to get the job done. I have seen true leadership from our executives in every aspect of growing the Company, and I look forward to building out our 2021 and 2022 plans together with this great team. With that I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow. John? Yes, thanks Bascome. I'll start and then ask Shelley or Darren or anybody else to come in. I think you hit on a lot of ideas that we have explored and had - have had success with in the past with different customers. One of the things we implemented some time ago in Dedicated was kind of an index-based pricing strategy, where we have a way to recognize labor cost and other inflationary pressures that are visible and easy to process. And recognize and apply to our pricing in a way that doesn't require all the activity we present in a bid work out, and we spend that time working on the business. We have a program, we call Customer Value Delivery, where we identify metrics, key performance indicators that keep us on track with service and performance, all those things can be tied together so that the energy is on the service, not the one way as we call it jump ball pricing. I think volume and different levels of either lane or total commitment can be helpful to - as Shelley said, provide the really needed guidance that we would want to present, i.e. to our rail providers to say hey, this is what we've got on the book. And if you look at Nick's business - and Nick, what's our retention now? It still 90. High 90s, so we know what's happening in that business year in and year out, and can really plan for that. And I think the reason that we have such high retention is because we do a really good job for the customer while else would they stay with us. And so that's - the idea here is can we apply some of that logic. We've had some experimentation with this. We've seen it work. We do think it's better for the customer. I mean, it's not just better for us, it's actually really better for the customer, and we've frankly made a living prioritizing that need. Let me see if Shelley or Darren want to add anything to that?"

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Brad. The second quarter has confirmed the comprehensive nature of the virus throughout the period. As noted, we immediately committed ourselves to the priorities of taking care of our people, and delivering on the promises we have made to our customers. We are encouraged with our results in both areas through the second quarter. More than 75% of our employee base has been unable to work from home due to the nature of our business and the ongoing needs of our customers. The safety practices and PPE supplies we deployed early and have continued to support and provide have proven substantially effective to date. We review both external and internal COVID-related data daily. We will continue to monitor the situation and maintain focus on these important priorities. Additional facility investments have been and are being made to all work areas in Lowell and across the country to help lower risk. Equally rewarding has been the recognition and encouragement from so many of our customers and acknowledging the performance of our people, particularly our drivers for providing consistent service and availability, moving freight to where it is needed. We stand ready and able to continue to serve them and their ultimate customers. Another important discussion that has developed during the second quarter is about inclusion and diversity. While this is not a new topic here at J.B. Hunt, the level and quality of dialogue has elevated in recent weeks. I can report that the entire executive leadership team is actively engaged in understanding where we are and determining where we want to go and improving these vital elements through all levels of the company. I will again recognize and thank the amazing employees of J.B. Hunt for their remarkable efforts to stay together, strong, safe and reliable over the past quarter. There is no quit in our people. Our field operators, drivers, maintenance technicians, along with our support teams in the field and in Lowell have remained vigilant and true to our mission. We are extremely proud of the entire organization. John Kuhlow will comment on our current financial situation. And as an enhancement to this call, our segment leaders will address the performance and trends in each of the business units. I will focus my remarks in the macro-view we have today across the top of the business. Clearly, we are off our original plans in many respects. And comparisons to last year do not help illuminate much about where we find ourselves. What we do know is that during the quarter we saw a stable and steady cadence of demand, particularly, in our Dedicated and Intermodal businesses, and even see some of the disruption in our Highway Services brokerage and truckload, signaling a similar upward slant to the demand curve, albeit difficult on near-term margins. At Final Mile, business lines are slowly, but surely working their way back online. Finally, our need to hire more drivers as an indication of what we hope is a bottom in the cycle. This is particularly encouraging in that we have experienced some of the lowest driver turnover ever in the past 4 months. While still too early to call, at least we have some potential signs of inflection in the demand curve. We will look for more direction from import data, inventory levels and retail sales information, as well as thoughtful input from our customers to build confidence in the trends into the second half of the year. Until that confidence firms, we maintain our current state of cost control efforts, a conservative capital expenditure approach, and contain payroll and hiring practices. We have restarted some strategic discussions around growth channel prospects, particularly in areas where we anticipate potential demand-driven rate-supported needs to expand fleet sizes, implementing new dedicated and final mile contracts as sales come back online, and positioning for new investments in technology, all in early stage preparation for what we hope is the inevitable return to normalcy. Having said all that, we are cautious. Recent COVID cases count expansion and the uncertainty of what that may present will drive us to hold back for now on any directional changes from the current state of conservative thinking. And again, we will maintain the priorities of keeping our people safe and striving to honor the commitments we have made to our customers going forward. With that, let me turn it over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John. As mentioned, the segment leaders will cover business unit results, so I\u2019ll add some comments on the consolidated financial results and update you on our approach to addressing the pandemic during the current quarter and also going forward. The effects of the pandemic are far reaching throughout our financial statements, impacting revenues, expenses, both positively and negatively, and throughout the quarter. It\u2019s difficult to talk through the specific impacts on each of the line items that the pandemic has had on our results. However, we have identified approximately $11 million of specific costs in the second quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic. These costs consist mostly special paid time-off for our employees quarantined, or for reduced pay from slowdowns as well as costs for personal protective equipment, cleaning and security directly related to protecting our employees. As previously announced, we incurred $15 million in the first quarter for COVID-related items for approximately $25 million year-to-date. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our long-term strategy around that has not changed. However, given the uncertainty entering the second quarter, we made an intentional adjustment for the sake of protecting liquidity. Our opportunistic approach to buybacks has always contemplated the cash needs and with excess cash being used for buybacks. We are confident in our balance sheet strength. We believe that the overall uncertainty of the market made it prudent to maintain higher cash positions until we received some clarity on the environment. Accordingly, we entered the quarter \u2013 ended the quarter with approximately $275 million in cash or net debt of approximately $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at one times EBITDA and expect to stay within close range of that metric throughout the year. We expect our capital allocation process in the second half of the year to include stock repurchases and previously forecasted capital expenditures, but we maintain a careful watch on a daily basis. We\u2019re currently forecasting our CapEx to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2020, which is down from our original plan of $700 million, mostly due to the timing after pausing certain projects within the second quarter. Our investment approach continues with our long-term strategy, we are carefully monitoring the market and environment assessing our power equipment and container needs, and purchasing those conditions warrant. As previously explained, our model in DCS is success driven. So that the extent we win new business or grow organically, our capital investment changes accordingly and we are well prepared to do so. From an M&A standpoint, I noted our target leverage ratio of one-times, but we\u2019re comfortable taking that higher if acquisition targets meet our ROIC and margin considerations. With respect to margins during the quarter we focused our intention to discretionary spend. In addition to eliminating travel, we suspended hiring unless there was a critical need. We were pleased with our ability to redeploy our people and assets from shuttered to surging accounts. And while most of that is reverted back to normal operations, we\u2019ll continue to use that strength as conditions warrant. We focus on our driver productivity using our people and assets as efficiently as possible, avoiding furloughs and layoffs to set us up to be in the best position as the economy comes back online. We continue to carefully review our spend balancing the need to invest for the long-term, but being mindful of the current environment. As we discussed during our first quarter call aside from the uncertainty of the freight market, we were concerned with the overall market liquidity and the impact it may have on our customers and their ability to pay. While we experienced a slightly higher level of uncollectible accounts during the second quarter, which we call out in the release. Overall, we were pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to deal with any payment issues. We continue to watch our working capital metrics on a frequent basis. With that, I\u2019ve concluded my prepared remarks and I\u2019ll turn it over to Darren to expand on Intermodal operations.\nDarren Field: Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I thought I would focus my comments on 3 primary areas: performance in the quarter; an update on Intermodal pricing dynamics; and finally provide some thoughts on fluidity of our network as a whole. First, I\u2019m extremely proud of the team\u2019s performance as they were able to react to significant demand swings from the start until the end of the quarter. Sitting here 3 months ago, we have little visibility into the outlook for the quarter, let alone the year, and to be honest, not much has changed as we sit here today. In April, we were experiencing meaningful declines in our business with expectations that conditions could further deteriorate based on expected port activity levels, availability of truck supply and lower fuel prices. That said we saw general improvement in volume trends as the quarter progress with the biggest surprise occurring in June. This is apparent with our monthly volumes which were down 6% in April, down 4% in May and positive 5% in the month of June. Feedback we received from customers was that sales trends were stronger than they expected as the economy began to reopen. And while we know there is a lot of focus on imports, we did not see a normal correlation between import data and our West Coast volumes. As it relates to pricing we discussed in our last earnings call, we would take a balanced approach to both volume and price during the bid season, and I believe we have executed on that strategy for 2020. At this point, we have completed pricing on approximately 80% of our published business with the remainder to implement in Q3. October 1 will begin a new pricing cycle. The rates we have \u2013 the rates have come in about where we would have expected, we finished Q2 at flat revenue per load excluding fuel on a year-over-year basis. Mix and stronger West Coast Transcon volumes are providing a lift to the revenue per load above what we would have anticipated. We have previously stated that we were very confident and we would outperform the general industry trends on volume. We based that thought on our awards from last year\u2019s bid process, which we will begin to lap in this third quarter. Given our pricing strategy this year, we do not anticipate a significant deviation from general industry trends, or at least not to the extent we experienced last year. The balance of our network continues to face significant challenges that I expect to become even more difficult in the third quarter. The reality of the mix of our current customer base is significantly stronger off the West Coast. We do expect we will have some cost pressure while we ship empty equipment to the West Coast that higher levels than we would have expected going into the year. Rail service has continued to hold up during the increase in volumes. As June volumes increased, we aren\u2019t experiencing the record level network rail service that occurred in March and April as volumes had declined. But as we have experienced a significant swing in demand, our rail providers have all worked strategically with us to solve for capacity challenges together with our rail providers, we understand the critical point in time to prove the value and strength of Intermodal as a solution with consideration for the massive capacity requirements. That concludes my remarks. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Shelley to discuss Highway Services.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll discuss some highlights with regard to our performance in Highway Services, which includes both our brokerage operations in ICS and our truck operations in JBT followed by showing some perspective that gives us increased confidence and the rollout of the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. Finally, I\u2019ll offer some thoughts on how we see the business continuing to evolve to solve the needs of our customers and create raving fans of the platform. First, as we stated at our Q1 earnings conference call, and John has alluded, we highlighted 2 key objectives for this most recent quarter: number one, taking care of and focusing on the health and safety of our people; and number two, serving and making sure we honor the commitments we have made to our customers. I am proud of the way our team and the organization responded to all the challenges, but we and our customers based in the quarter. With regards to the quarter market dynamics in Q2, we\u2019re unique to say the least, while we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our published business, spot opportunities for the most part were non-existent, and revenue was further pressured by rates or revenue per load versus a year ago. Additionally, while part of our strategy is to grow our penetration with small and medium sized shippers, I believe the segment of the market was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also put pressure on some aspects of our business. Second, I\u2019m extremely encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, which strengthens our confidence in the rollout of our platform. The trended data support our belief that customers and carriers are increasingly wanting to connect digitally. This enhances both visibility and transparency for both parties and we believe market adoption is continuing to build momentum, as evidenced by our shipments per day in the platform continued to grow at double digits versus a year ago. And what I would describe as a fairly challenging environment to grow volumes. I believe this is also supported by the level of engagement and activity that we see in the platform. When we talk about engagement activity, what are we really talking about? Well, we\u2019re talking about the number of available loads, number of load searches, number of offers, offers per load, number of carriers approved and activated, as well as users in the platform. In fact, all of the KPIs we tracked in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 over 75% of those KPIs hit all-time records in the quarter. As we continue to scale the platform, we have data to support that there\u2019s incredible value and efficiencies for both the shipping and carrier communities as they transact in the platform. Enhancing value and efficiencies for both shipper and carrier community very much aligns with our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. So we remain encouraged by the data, not only how it creates value for the market, but also in terms of the visibility provides to our team, and ensure that we utilize our own assets as efficiently as possible. As an example, we eliminated over 2 million new backhaul miles for both our JBI and DCS segments in the quarter, which exceeds what we\u2019ve eliminated in all of 2019. This is just another example of how we see benefits across our organization from the platform. Now focusing on our investment in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. We remain committed to our investment targeted in 3 key areas: our people, technology; and scaling the platform. We believe our investments to continue at the current pace on both people and technology firms. We do not or we do expect to continue to gain efficiencies in the platform with automation, but also expect some of those efficiencies to be reinvested in our sales force to help build greater scale. Market dynamics will also play a significant factor in terms of our ability to scale. So we will have to see how the market evolves. But it is worth noting at this point scaling the platform is the primary opportunity and risk to achieving profitability by the second half of 2021. It is also worth noting that we remain committed to building out our 360box program, which falls in our JBT segment, as JBT continues to shift into more of an asset-light service offering. In closing, we continue to see both ICS and JBT as well as our DCS and JBI businesses growing and evolving to becoming even more complementary within the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Nick to talk about both Dedicated and Final Mile.\nNick Hobbs: Good afternoon. I\u2019ll focus my comments on the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile in the quarter, what opportunities and challenges we see in the current market and wrap up with some high-level expectations for these businesses in the future. I\u2019ll start with Final Mile or FMS. As we\u2019ve discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we expected Final Mile to be significantly impacted by the business disruptions caused by COVID-19, and clearly, that was the case. While results were better than we expected, it was largely due to both the economy, and in particular, our customers opening back up for business sooner than originally planned. Across the 3 primary areas served by FMS, we saw some of the biggest challenges from our [pool] [ph] distribution businesses, which as a reminder, provides inventory replenishment services for off-price retailers, most of which remain closed for a significant portion of the quarter. Next, our furniture business was the second hardest hit, and saw overall activity down about 30%. And finally, our appliance business, despite a slower start, finished about in line with normal activity level. While the economic outlook and recent rise in COVID cases could create additional noise in Q3, at this point, our expectations are we should see FMS return to profitability this quarter. To finish up on FMS, we remain very encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers, as well as the opportunities to grow this business over the long term. We believe our assets and asset-light final mile solutions provides customers with a range of value-added services in this rapidly growing channel. Now, on to Dedicated or DCS. First, I\u2019m extremely proud of our performance in Dedicated, which delivered strong results in light of all the challenges in the market. While the driver of this performance was primarily a result of strong execution from our team as it relates to asset turns and utilization, lower startup costs, stronger safety performance, and lower driver turnover also contributed to margin benefits. I think the performance that this team delivered highlights a key metric that we focus on internally, and that is delivering on our CVD or Customer Value Delivery. We perform an extensive review of each of our accounts throughout the year, quantify the value we are able to deliver to the customer. Over the last 2 quarters with the extreme examples we experienced from customers closing down facilities to some accounts surging as much as 150% above base levels, our customers enjoyed outstanding service and the flexibility offered by professionally outsourced fleet solution, a solution that we think cannot easily be replicated, given our size and density across the country. I think this performance also speaks to our diverse portfolio of industries that we serve, from agriculture, food, home improvement, grocery, manufacturing, retail and others. We sold 430 trucks worth of new Dedicated business year to date. We still expect to fall within our previously stated range of 600 to 800 trucks for the year. And while the pipeline remains strong, we do have some concerns with regards to new prospects entering the early stages of our pipeline as a result of limited opportunities for our sales team to engage with potential customers. We will have to see how this plays out. But it could slow the pace of sales and startups later this year and into early 2021. Net-net, as it stands now, we expect the fleet count to remain relatively stable from Q2 levels as some of our fleet additions will be offset some attrition, we are seeing at some of our existing accounts. That concludes my remarks. So I think we\u2019re ready to turn it back over to the operator and open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nJohn Roberts: Hey, Stephanie, as you\u2019re building the queue, just a reminder to everybody, one question and one follow up please just in for time sake.\nOperator: And our first question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, afternoon, guys. So, Darren, just a couple for you. Maybe any color you can give us on volume trends in April. Your commentary around the West Coast imbalances, as a cost issue, do you think that there is some offset where it helps rev per load? And then, any change in thinking on the 11% to 13% margins longer term?\nDarren Field: Okay, well, that was a predictable question. I\u2019ll get that out of the way right away. No, we haven\u2019t changed our long-term outlook on our margin target. That continues to be our target. From the volume perspective, yeah, I think in the earlier comments in the call, we were highlighting that while prices were coming in relatively in line with what we had expected going into the year, mix was contributing to benefit on revenue per load and our revenue per load was flat for the quarter. So pricing is not necessarily flat. Prices have been slightly negative. But the mix of our traffic is driving a benefit to that in keeping our revenue per load at a flat level. From a volume perspective, April was headed down rapidly. At the time we did this call back in mid-April we were seeing bookings. And feedback from our customers suggested that we were going to be really, really in \u2013 headed down. And by the end of the month, it did obviously kind of stabilize with I think we said negative 6% in April. At that point, you started with a lot of info on blanking of ships and import traffic really, really falling, and so we were concerned a lot about May and June. But as the quarter continued on, volumes hung in there. And then, as we got into June, really volumes were significantly stronger than we had anticipated. We did highlight that we\u2019re beginning to lap the comparisons against last year. Last year, at this time, during the third quarter, we had some nice gains in our volumes from \u2013 through the pricing cycles with customers. And we\u2019re going to begin to compare against that, so volumes being 5% up in June, as we highlighted earlier. Our volume run rate so far in July has been relatively in line with the same weekly volumes we\u2019re doing in June. But the comparison is certainly different. So the comp will get more and more difficult as we move through the third quarter on growth percent.\nScott Group: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just last one for Nick. You\u2019ve had 2 quarters of 15% margins. How are you thinking about margins either back half of the year and then longer-term relative to the 11% to 13% target?\nNick Hobbs: We\u2019re not going to change our long-term margins at this point. We\u2019ve got some really unique benefits from very, very low driver turnover, safety results that were phenomenal just because less amount of traffic out on the road, no T&E. So we just got a lot of things. So we need to let this get by us before we really reassess that. But we\u2019re comfortable with our stated margins as they are right now.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you for the time, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and congrats on the quarter. So maybe to start with Intermodal, going back to some of your commentary, Darren, any expectation you\u2019d be willing to share on Intermodal volumes as we look into the third and fourth quarter? And then, in terms of market share, now that we\u2019re wrapping up bid season, it doesn\u2019t sound like anything changed materially, but just wanted to get your thoughts around that as well.\nDarren Field: Yeah, Justin, I don\u2019t think I can really give any kind of guidance on volume moving forward. I would say, it\u2019s very clearly our expectation to grow with the market. At a minimum, we expect to maintain our market share and feel confident in our ability to do that. That\u2019s probably about as much as I can say about volumes moving forward at this point.\nJustin Long: Okay, fair enough. And then, on intermodal pricing, you mentioned the new cycle starts October 1. I wanted to ask how you\u2019re thinking about intermodal pricing in the next year relative to TL pricing. Is your expectation that the rate of change from a contractual perspective should look similar as we kind of get into the early stages of this recovery? Or is there a reason to think we see a divergence between the two?\nDarren Field: Historically, I think with \u2013 the length of haul is so much different between truckload and intermodal. There are times that the truckload price might dip further than in intermodal. But at times when prices are climbing, the inverse is true. The truckload price is climbing further as a percentage simply because it\u2019s a smaller revenue per load. I don\u2019t know that how to forecast next year. I do think that in the current environment, as we sit here today, July 16, it feels like we have some cost pressure coming at us. And so, I would expect that prices will have some \u2013 we\u2019ll be talking to customers about cost pressures, certainly, the railroads will have something to say about their cost challenges. And we\u2019ll all be talking more about that and learning more. I know John had highlighted in his comments, we\u2019re cautious right now in this environment. We just don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see 3 months, 4 months from now, much less next year in that pricing cycle. But as we sit here today, I do think that we\u2019re all feeling some challenges on the cost front headed our way.\nJustin Long: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Thanks, operator. Congrats, everybody, on the solid results. Darren, if I could I just wanted to follow up on the intermodal June outperformance. I mean, we\u2019ve heard \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s been pretty much out there. The shippers are being a little bit more aggressive on per diem box costs. And, of course, you guys have an advantage there with your huge container fleet. Anything there that may explain some of the outperformance in June or any specific about port inventories being relatively high and there was maybe a pent-up demand release as the economy started opening up? I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the underlying dynamics are with respect to the volume improvement and if those are sustainable or maybe explained by specific things that are happening in what is really kind of a unique and volatile environment.\nDarren Field: Sure, okay. Well, I don\u2019t know that I think our ability to that demurrage on box time at customers and detention billing, whether it\u2019s a rail loan piece of equipment or private and the different philosophies amongst all the different providers for intermodal has a lot to do with it. I think over our experience with our customers, I\u2019d like to believe we have proven ourselves as a high-quality service provider. We have \u2013 we do have a large fleet of containers and we certainly have been \u2013 have relationships with a wide variety of customers. And that lend itself well to us in June. We were positioned with equipment in the right markets. When we needed the equipment it was right there for us and available to help our customers with their demand. Just the data around imports and port activity compared to our \u2013 even the domestic intermodal business as a whole, just we haven\u2019t been able to figure out a direct correlation as to how that looked in June. It just feels like there was a little bit of a disconnect. Demand certainly seemed higher than what the import data would have suggested. I don\u2019t know if that is pent-up demand from equipment at ports or if it\u2019s simply there was more inventory in the West Coast warehouses. I\u2019d have to ask customers to help determine that. But at the end of the day, I think our customers trusted us and gave us the opportunity for a strong business in June, from all the years of experience we\u2019ve had working with those customers.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just for my follow-up question, the intermodal margins were obviously, I think, great in the context of volumes and then general pricing. But I guess the network was, obviously, still unbalanced in the quarter and that\u2019s introduced some extra cost and have a detrimental kind of network effect. Is that getting easier in July or the third quarter in terms of some of those headwinds on the profitability of the intermodal business? And then, obviously, box turns have been lower than where you\u2019d like. Do you expect that to get better kind of sequentially as the volume environment gets better?\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, with the overall second quarter being at negative 2%. If we can get our volume back to something north of 2%, I would expect the turn number in the third quarter to look better. I mean, the turn number is going to be related to volume, in April and in May weren\u2019t very good in the quarter. So, from a box turns\u2019 perspective, I would expect a slight improvement. From a margin perspective, we\u2019ve had \u2013 Nick highlighted in some of his comments, we had very successful quarter on the safety front that was effective for us and helped us on the margin front. We had low driver turnover that helps us on the margin front. We were able to use our drayage assets at a higher percentage. And we dipped into some of the outsourcing we do in that area. That\u2019s beneficial to our margin. We do still need price to really move and help and improve margin. But if \u2013 just on a sequential perspective, I think that I highlighted that the network balance in Q3 I think is actually going to become a larger challenge for us in Q3 than it was in Q2. For a lot of the first half of the year, we were positioning our equipment into the market, where we expected volume to return. And so, we had equipment already in California. We had equipment in the Midwest, in Chicago, where demand began to come back faster. Well, as the network is running today, we\u2019re going to be moving more empty equipment. And not all of our customers are back at the same pace. And that\u2019s creating a little bit of a hard prediction of the network impact from balance. But I expect in Q3 to actually be more challenged on the network balance than we were even in Q2.\nAmit Mehrotra: So you think Q3 margins could be down than 2Q or is that just still going to be dependent on the volume environment, how strong it is?\nDarren Field: Well, we just aren\u2019t going to comment on the expectation of the margin in the next quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks for helping, everyone. You guys have done a pretty good job, as you said, of keeping your share in intermodal growing much faster than the overall industry. But are you surprised at all that intermodal volumes haven\u2019t come back stronger than they have in the back half of 2Q, especially relative to what trucking volumes have done?\nJohn Roberts: Well, I\u2019m surprised, Ravi, I don\u2019t know how to characterize my thought on that. In a global pandemic, I guess, I just don\u2019t know what would have surprised us, or what we would have expected any more than what did happen. I mean, the networks are all busy today. I\u2019m certain we have competitors that experience a lift in their volumes as well. I mean, the whole entire system is moving more business in the back-half of June than it certainly was in April and May.\nRavi Shanker: Okay, understood. And then, maybe a follow-up for Shelley, Shelley, can you give us an update on the competitive environment in the truck brokerage business, both from some of the larger incumbents as well as some of the new digital entrants? Kind of have you seen any change in either of them in terms of behavior?\nShelley Simpson: I think the market\u2019s been difficult. Particularly, in the brokerage business, it has had wild fluctuations from a margin perspective, and then also was right in the middle of the kind of the last part of the bid process. So I think it\u2019s been difficult to estimate what margins would look like in the month much less putting in a full year price for customers. So we have seen really the front-half of the quarter to the back-half of the quarter prices did change from a bid process. And what customers are awarded volumes at, I would say it was more competitive in the first-half of the quarter versus the second-half of the quarter. And we\u2019ve seen customers across our segments come back with more mini bid, and bids that weren\u2019t getting implemented or carriers weren\u2019t taking the volumes that were awarded. Those are coming back out in mini bids from a tighter capacity environment, really across the board in general. I would say we\u2019ve seen some larger brokers, I think, defend their position, much like we would as well. So I don\u2019t think that anybody was ill behaved in the market. But I do think it\u2019s been a more competitive price environment from large incumbents and then from a digital freight perspective, I think that there\u2019s not a lot of change there. There\u2019s always been an aggressive mentality from a price perspective, with customers, but I don\u2019t think anything is different.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi, just a question. Can you refresh my memory on what your DCS Dedicated margin target is? Obviously, it\u2019s been pretty solid. And I know you mentioned some of the reasons behind it. But if you could touch on that a little bit? That would be great.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah, it\u2019s 11% to 13% is where we\u2019re at. And that that kind of guidelines that we try to bounce around in between and it\u2019s affected a lot. If we have a lot of startups, sometimes it gets a little thinner. But a lot of factors go into that, but that\u2019s our target.\nJordan Alliger: But is there any reason to think in the near-term that the pace you\u2019re at now from a margin standpoint would be different in the coming quarter or 2?\nJohn Roberts: It is \u2013 what\u2019s going to happen in the next 2 or 3 months with the pandemic then I can probably help you on that. But I really don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know what the volume is going to do with our customers were very agile, but if it was normal times maybe I could give you a better prediction. But I\u2019m just nervous about what it\u2019s going to do with all the COVID cases coming back up and all those things, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to shut business now. It\u2019s just affecting different industry at different way. So I really wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable addressing the next couple of quarters.\nJordan Alliger: Got it. And then just on truck brokerage that was very helpful rundown on the pricing front. I\u2019m just curious as you \u2013 so many moving pieces in truck brokerage these days and second quarter was probably a tale of 2 halves as you alluded to, but do you feel like taking into account, price and competitiveness that the framework excluding all the costs you have from 360. The framework for truck brokerage is looking brighter at this point from a profit perspective?\nShelley Simpson: I would say that as we have ended the second quarter and began the third quarter, that the margins are unsustainable inside brokerage, I would say, across the industry right now. So you\u2019re really seeing the supply demand tightness occurring. I think it\u2019s one of the most constrained environments I have seen. Obviously, we are in a pandemic, but I think that in this market, the number of turndowns that are occurring from customers, the challenges that are happening from a capacity perspective, and then the lack of margin, if you will, I think things if they were to continue as is, I think things will change in near-term versus long-term. I do think that brokerage as an overall is a great answer for our customers, it has gained market share over the last several years as a total as a percentage of total shipments that are happening. And it\u2019s because the flexibility and being able to be agile in price and capacity for customers, when surges in demand are happening. So I think that outlook is good. We just have to get through the near-term headwinds that are occurring in the business.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. And great job on the quarter. John or Darren, maybe you could talk a little bit about the opportunity to grow capacity you mentioned that earlier. But then you also mentioned \u2013 kind of John mentioned being cautious on the use of cash. So obviously conflicting thought there maybe you can just delve into that in a bit.\nDarren Field: So at this point to grow capacity for Intermodal would require \u2013 you\u2019re going to place a container order with a manufacturer, there aren\u2019t a lot of manufacturing opportunities located here in North America. So if it is as much about the opportunity to produce and provide the transportation for the containers into the country in a timely enough manner to assist in certainly this year. We are trying to be more balanced in \u2013 or we are trying to be balanced in both volume and price as we\u2019ve been talking about for really several quarters now. And our margins need some improvement and so we\u2019re cautious on how quickly we want to go add capacity. At the same time, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on truckload capacity is there an opportunity to get back to a stronger growth trajectory for Intermodal in the Eastern network that would certainly drive some consideration and expanding our fleet and investing in more capacity. It will always, always, always be our goal to grow Intermodal, but we understand the return profile our shareholders expect, we expect and hold ourselves is to going to drive that decision first.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Darren. And then for a quick follow-up on, Shelley. Just you talked about the losses kind of going 12 to 18 months at ICS, when you started the plan, just want to understand how do you think about that is now and maybe in the answer you can talk about your thoughts on spot and contract pricing as you see in the market now?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, I talked about that in my opening remarks that really scaling the business is an important component in our return to profitability. As we have created a level of investment right now that is should be able to scale really from here and depending on how quickly we can add revenue will depend on how quickly returned to profitability. In total, I am somewhat cautious as to what the second half will look like. But as Nick said earlier, we really don\u2019t have great forecasts from our customers as to what revenue is going to do or shipments are going to do. So I think it\u2019s too early to tell what would happen from that perspective. When I look at what\u2019s happened in both spot and published, I think that you saw inside the quarter spot revenue per shipment moved down substantially and then back up with a rebound in June. And so things were very different by month in the quarter in total, and published pricing really is at a low watermark that I think has room to move as carriers are pushing prices on a day to day basis from a brokerage perspective, I think, price will change at the customer view as well. There \u2013 before COVID, there was a change occurring and I talked about this in our Q1 earnings release call that January and December were both unusually and unseasonably tight in those weeks that I talked about. We\u2019ve seen some of that emerge back here in June and continuing into July. So I think published pricing will move I think it is moving as we speak. And I know certainly, we\u2019re talking through with customers what that means when it comes to other business that they\u2019re talking to us about, and I\u2019m certainly talking to others about as well.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Let me just picking up on that last point. Shelley, can you talk a little bit \u2013 you mentioned sort of the 2 halves of the quarter on the ICS gross margin side? Can you give us a little bit of sense of the magnitude of the potential change downward as you kind of exited 2Q and maybe a little bit of a sense of what maybe things look like here in July? Just trying to get to scale the magnitude of the potential changes as the quarter progressed.\nShelley Simpson: Yeah, I would say at the start of the quarter, we experienced what I would characterize as the high end of our margins, and at the end of June, we experienced at the low end of our margin. So the swing was significant throughout the quarter in total. I think, moving into July, there\u2019s been an even further tightening and there\u2019s evidence of that in reports around turndowns and what we\u2019ve seen from an MDI perspective as well in the industry. So we\u2019re certainly feeling that impact from a price perspective at a spot capacity with carriers. So I would say it\u2019s probably tightest right now here in July.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then just back to the 360-scaling comment and how that relates to the back half of next year and the potential for turning profit, the profit at that point. I guess, I just didn\u2019t quite understand I think you said it was an opportunity, but also a potential execution point, as you think about that scaling up. So could you maybe help us a little better understand what you know now is sort of the back half of next year still sort of the most likely case for profit coming back from an ICS perspective? I just want to make sure I wasn\u2019t sort of missing something in that explanation.\nShelley Simpson: Yeah, I think right now, the back half of next year, we still have scheduled to return to profitability. But it will be \u2013 I talked about this in my opening remarks, we have redeployed resources that we\u2019ve already seen efficiency in scaling the business operationally into our customer\u2019s side of the business. And so we have made investments in scaling their platform in technology and in people, and so holding those costs flat as we build revenue, each one of those as a percentage of revenue start to contribute more towards the bottom line. There is a revenue number that really takes us into a profitable state as an organization, and that will largely depend on how quickly we can get there. And if COVID has an impact more than what it has had really in April and May. I would say if the environment stays like it is right now, I still feel comfortable with the second half of 2021. But things have changed throughout the quarter. So it\u2019s very difficult for us to predict what\u2019s going to happen.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Very clear. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, thank you for the time. Shelley, I know you\u2019ve been asked a couple in a row. I guess, I\u2019m going to keep that string going. How do you think about \u2013 that we\u2019re seeing that the freight market tightened and improved quite a bit in June and through the quarter. And it sounds like you\u2019re pretty happy with how the technology is working and the \u2013 I guess, you mentioned a lot of the KPI is working well. But yet, we saw the volumes down 11%. It just \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s surprising not to see volumes do better in that environment. And especially if you compare with Intermodal seems some improvement just down, I guess, 1.5%. So what do you think is happening, that you\u2019re not getting more traction on the volume side and ICS? And what do you think of is that that would really change that, because it sounds like that\u2019s really a key factor in terms of seeing a lot of volume growth and share gain in brokerage?\nShelley Simpson: So my opening remarks, I did talk about that the platform experienced double-digit volume increases. And so you think about how we\u2019re connecting with both shippers and carriers digitally, that means that connecting points happening through our technology, so that actually scaled in the platform. If I also mentioned what happened with spot volumes throughout the quarter, we have been growing and continued to grow in Q2, our committed contractual business with customers. So we call that our published business that business continue to experience good market share growth in those segments that was offset by what happened in the spot market in total. So both from a revenue per load and total shipment, we just could not overcome the last spot in both April and May. We did see that rebound in June and has continued to see that move forward in July.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Thank you. My other questions just to kind of overall freight view, a \u2013 some of the comments certainly point to tightness in the market in June and July, I think saw some nice growth in June in volume, but your overall commentary seems kind of cautious on the outlook, despite pretty significant tightness in freight right now. What is that that really is driving the caution? Or do you think that there\u2019s a framework that freight could keep improving, as we look into third quarter?\nShelley Simpson: Well, I think the cautiousness comes as a result of just our experience what\u2019s happened here in Q2, if you recall our discussion points from the first quarter, we had a lot of caution as to what would happen in Q2. And I think that served us well, because each month was different than expectation. And I\u2019m not even sure that we had good expectations from both our customers and also internally. So as we saw Q2 really go through a wild roller coaster ride, we aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s going to happen in Q3. I do think that volumes could continue to move up. But I think what Nick said earlier around what\u2019s happening with the pandemic, with cases rising, we just aren\u2019t sure what\u2019s going to happen to the end consumer. So it\u2019s just too difficult for us to say exactly what is going to happen. We really can speak about what\u2019s happening right now and the forecast for the next few weeks and past that our customers are struggling, knowing what\u2019s going to happen and certainly we are as well.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. So it\u2019s really good right now, but just concerned on COVID.\nShelley Simpson: Correct.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Okay. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes on the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Shelley, I\u2019ll give you a break. And I\u2019ll ask Nick a question. On the expectations for final mile to shift to being profitable in the third quarter, is final mile at a point now where if you consistently operate in that 2% to 4% margin range? And then, Nick, I think you gave some comments on your expectation for Dedicated growth on the fleet size into the back half. What\u2019s your thought on final mile with the shift that we\u2019re seeing right now and consumption to have, so that\u2019s still a 10% top-line growth business? Or does that change or accelerate either based on end markets and consumer trends?\nNick Hobbs: I think that\u2019s a good question. Of course, right now the demand is very high. It\u2019s a small niche industry. But exercise equipment in home is really strong right now. So we\u2019re seeing that grow appliances. As I said, my statement is very solid enough. Furniture is really coming back, strong, not back to where it was, but coming back strong. So we really see that final mile is going to have some good growth and excited about that the margin guidance, I think we\u2019re comfortable with what you said there that we\u2019ll see that so the demand is really good. The off-price retail that is our final mile is normally \u2013 it\u2019s okay during this time of the year. But it is really, really strong force at this point. So we hope that\u2019ll stay up there and continue. So that\u2019s good. And then the dedicated demand, we\u2019re still going with our 600 to 800 truck adds just what we think. We still love that model. I think the growth is going to be stronger next year once we get out of the pandemic, if people can start seeing this, because it is a big decision to replace the private fleet. It takes a while to sell it. I\u2019ve always said 18 to 22 months, but it takes a lot of face-time to do that as well. And it\u2019s hard to do on Teams meeting or Zoom or whatever you\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re hitting \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a little pause there. We\u2019ve sold 430 trucks so far this year. And so hopefully that will pick up a little bit in the back half, again depending upon what the pandemics doing.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That makes sense. And just for one quick follow-up on the COVID costs add in 2Q that $11 million. It feels like that that\u2019s kind of the right run rate for the foreseeable future? Or are there any things that would shift that to either be higher or lower, as we think about modeling into the back half? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow: Yeah. Todd, this is John Kuhlow. I think most of that is some of the special PTO we\u2019ve had for our quarantine. And then also, it\u2019s on PPE. And so, I think that the PPE is going to continue, we are seeing the PTO drop off a little bit. And as Nick and others have mentioned, we really don\u2019t know what\u2019s \u2013 if there\u2019s a second wave or how it\u2019s going to look. But for right now, I think that most of those that\u2019s a pretty good run rate.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. That helps. Thanks for the time.\nJohn Roberts: Hey, Stephanie, we\u2019ve got time for one last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good evening. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Shelley, just wanted to come back to you on the truckload market in overall capacity. You mentioned supply has been different dynamics and different points during the quarter, even last quarter. So what do you think is the underlying factors, a few factors here? And how do you see that progressing throughout the remainder of the year sort of independent of what the demand side does?\nShelley Simpson: Well, Brian, I think that\u2019s been the question for us really for the quarter. We had that question also in the first quarter of the tightening that was occurring from a supply perspective early on. We do think that possibly PPE and unemployment has had an impact from a supply perspective. I also think that, prices really fell in April and May. And there was a lot of frustration from a carrier community, because they live in a spot environment from a PTE perspective. And so, I think that some of those carriers chose to stay home and chose to do other work outside of the trucking industry until business came back or business was in a healthier state. And so, I think that could impact part of it as well. I would tell you, I think we\u2019re seeing signs of a change in the environment from a cost perspective that Darren talked about earlier. If that were to continue to occur, I think that\u2019s putting pressure on margins across the board. And we\u2019ll have to think about what that means over the longer term. Certainly, we\u2019ll be ready to handle that. But as we\u2019re working closely with our customers, to help our customers right now, one thing that\u2019s happening is business is out of balance. And so, we talked a little bit about what\u2019s happening on the West Coast. That\u2019s also happening throughout the country as there are different customers shipping right now in different lanes that are moving right now, that\u2019s causing a problem in the market as well. And so that problem we\u2019re working closely with customers. We want to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises of our customers. That\u2019s creating an environment also, from a spot perspective, that\u2019s constraining margins.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, got it. And then, just one last one for Darren, actually, the point on network balance, it\u2019s always been a goal difficult to do in practice for a lot of the reasons we already talked about. And it sounds like it\u2019s actually going to be more challenging in the third quarter, so maybe just help me understand what it is that you\u2019re doing differently, because I think historically, we\u2019ve seen it is much easier, obviously, to get balanced in a strong free market, which we may or may not have going forward here. So maybe you can just help me understand what\u2019s different with this goal to sort of get there. Independent of the freight market, is there extra capacity? You need to manage through lanes that need to be adjusted. What else is going into that equation?\nDarren Field: Okay, so really, I mean the balance challenges come from the opportunities for growth and the rate of shipping from our customers. I mean, there was a significant lift in West Coast demand to come eastbound, which are predominantly imported cargoes. The cargo that\u2019s going westbound is going to be food products and consumer products to support the large population basis on the West Coast. So, the realities are it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s been driven mostly from import goods that may be consumer behavior and that the high sales from some of various retailers. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the balance challenge. From a \u2013 when we talk about balance challenges too, we\u2019re a growth organization. We\u2019re always going to try to grow. We want to grow. That\u2019s our goal every minute of every day. So you\u2019re not going to grow with balance. So I don\u2019t expect this to be balanced. But I do expect the ability to improve on the network from where we were a year ago. In this year, in this particular kind of very odd time, that\u2019s been more difficult then. But I view that more as an outcome of the pandemic and kind of the odd state of consumers and the way our shippers or the patterns that our shippers are moving in.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, got it. Thanks for that, Darren.\nBrad Delco: Stephanie, I think John is going to close off with some finishing comments.\nOperator: Certainly, please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. Thank you, all of you, for your participation today. I think we\u2019ve had some good discussion here. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m really proud of our leadership team. This is a very experienced group of people. We really have seen a lot of different conditions in different markets through different cycles. And I know that we are talking a lot about the future state of during and after the pandemic. What the demand changes will be in areas for our core businesses and what demand changes will present in new opportunities for us in technology and e-commerce and I things that \u2013 feel like they\u2019re going to be a part of our conversation. I think the quarter did present some positives. But I think the cautious tone that you hear from us is that we just still don\u2019t have enough longer-term data to say this is how we feel that you can sort of rely on of what we\u2019re looking for. But we are talking and watching carefully. So know that it\u2019s a very active discussion. We\u2019re still waiting to see that confidence firm up and we\u2019ll obviously keep you posted. On the questions around margin dynamics, obviously, we discussed those questions. And again, we\u2019re just not in normal times. So let us have enough to kind of see what our normal cycle, normal demand will look like and we\u2019ll be able to have more thought on that going forward. Yeah. The last thing I would say is that we continue to be very highly integrated as an organization. That\u2019s both with our people and with our customers. Several comments throughout this hour have been around that sharing of data, sharing of people, working with customers and really finding ways to continue to deliver on those promises. So I think that\u2019s important. When you look at J.B. Hunt, I think, you have to think about the whole package. We appreciate your [indiscernible] interest and that we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Speakers please hold the line.",

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John. As mentioned, the segment leaders will cover business unit results, so I'll add some comments on the consolidated financial results and update you on our approach to addressing the pandemic during the current quarter and also going forward. The effects of the pandemic are far reaching throughout our financial statements, impacting revenues, expenses, both positively and negatively, and throughout the quarter. It's difficult to talk through the specific impacts on each of the line items that the pandemic has had on our results. However, we have identified approximately $11 million of specific costs in the second quarter that were not planned prior to the pandemic. These costs consist mostly special paid time-off for our employees quarantined, or for reduced pay from slowdowns as well as costs for personal protective equipment, cleaning and security directly related to protecting our employees. As previously announced, we incurred $15 million in the first quarter for COVID-related items for approximately $25 million year-to-date. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment and our long-term strategy around that has not changed. However, given the uncertainty entering the second quarter, we made an intentional adjustment for the sake of protecting liquidity. Our opportunistic approach to buybacks has always contemplated the cash needs and with excess cash being used for buybacks. We are confident in our balance sheet strength. We believe that the overall uncertainty of the market made it prudent to maintain higher cash positions until we received some clarity on the environment. Accordingly, we entered the quarter \u2013 ended the quarter with approximately $275 million in cash or net debt of approximately $1 billion. We still target our leverage ratio at one times EBITDA and expect to stay within close range of that metric throughout the year. We expect our capital allocation process in the second half of the year to include stock repurchases and previously forecasted capital expenditures, but we maintain a careful watch on a daily basis. We're currently forecasting our CapEx to be approximately $600 million to $625 million for 2020, which is down from our original plan of $700 million, mostly due to the timing after pausing certain projects within the second quarter. Our investment approach continues with our long-term strategy, we are carefully monitoring the market and environment assessing our power equipment and container needs, and purchasing those conditions warrant. As previously explained, our model in DCS is success driven. So that the extent we win new business or grow organically, our capital investment changes accordingly and we are well prepared to do so. From an M&A standpoint, I noted our target leverage ratio of one-times, but we're comfortable taking that higher if acquisition targets meet our ROIC and margin considerations. With respect to margins during the quarter we focused our intention to discretionary spend. In addition to eliminating travel, we suspended hiring unless there was a critical need. We were pleased with our ability to redeploy our people and assets from shuttered to surging accounts. And while most of that is reverted back to normal operations, we'll continue to use that strength as conditions warrant. We focus on our driver productivity using our people and assets as efficiently as possible, avoiding furloughs and layoffs to set us up to be in the best position as the economy comes back online. We continue to carefully review our spend balancing the need to invest for the long-term, but being mindful of the current environment. As we discussed during our first quarter call aside from the uncertainty of the freight market, we were concerned with the overall market liquidity and the impact it may have on our customers and their ability to pay. While we experienced a slightly higher level of uncollectible accounts during the second quarter, which we call out in the release. Overall, we were pleased with how our teams worked with our customers to deal with any payment issues. We continue to watch our working capital metrics on a frequent basis. With that, I've concluded my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Darren to expand on Intermodal operations. Yeah. Todd, this is John Kuhlow. I think most of that is some of the special PTO we've had for our quarantine. And then also, it's on PPE. And so, I think that the PPE is going to continue, we are seeing the PTO drop off a little bit. And as Nick and others have mentioned, we really don't know what's \u2013 if there's a second wave or how it's going to look. But for right now, I think that most of those that's a pretty good run rate."

            "content": "Good afternoon. I'll focus my comments on the performance of both Dedicated and Final Mile in the quarter, what opportunities and challenges we see in the current market and wrap up with some high-level expectations for these businesses in the future. I'll start with Final Mile or FMS. As we've discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we expected Final Mile to be significantly impacted by the business disruptions caused by COVID-19, and clearly, that was the case. While results were better than we expected, it was largely due to both the economy, and in particular, our customers opening back up for business sooner than originally planned. Across the 3 primary areas served by FMS, we saw some of the biggest challenges from our [pool] [ph] distribution businesses, which as a reminder, provides inventory replenishment services for off-price retailers, most of which remain closed for a significant portion of the quarter. Next, our furniture business was the second hardest hit, and saw overall activity down about 30%. And finally, our appliance business, despite a slower start, finished about in line with normal activity level. While the economic outlook and recent rise in COVID cases could create additional noise in Q3, at this point, our expectations are we should see FMS return to profitability this quarter. To finish up on FMS, we remain very encouraged by the level of engagement with our customers, as well as the opportunities to grow this business over the long term. We believe our assets and asset-light final mile solutions provides customers with a range of value-added services in this rapidly growing channel. Now, on to Dedicated or DCS. First, I'm extremely proud of our performance in Dedicated, which delivered strong results in light of all the challenges in the market. While the driver of this performance was primarily a result of strong execution from our team as it relates to asset turns and utilization, lower startup costs, stronger safety performance, and lower driver turnover also contributed to margin benefits. I think the performance that this team delivered highlights a key metric that we focus on internally, and that is delivering on our CVD or Customer Value Delivery. We perform an extensive review of each of our accounts throughout the year, quantify the value we are able to deliver to the customer. Over the last 2 quarters with the extreme examples we experienced from customers closing down facilities to some accounts surging as much as 150% above base levels, our customers enjoyed outstanding service and the flexibility offered by professionally outsourced fleet solution, a solution that we think cannot easily be replicated, given our size and density across the country. I think this performance also speaks to our diverse portfolio of industries that we serve, from agriculture, food, home improvement, grocery, manufacturing, retail and others. We sold 430 trucks worth of new Dedicated business year to date. We still expect to fall within our previously stated range of 600 to 800 trucks for the year. And while the pipeline remains strong, we do have some concerns with regards to new prospects entering the early stages of our pipeline as a result of limited opportunities for our sales team to engage with potential customers. We will have to see how this plays out. But it could slow the pace of sales and startups later this year and into early 2021. Net-net, as it stands now, we expect the fleet count to remain relatively stable from Q2 levels as some of our fleet additions will be offset some attrition, we are seeing at some of our existing accounts. That concludes my remarks. So I think we're ready to turn it back over to the operator and open the line for questions. We're not going to change our long-term margins at this point. We've got some really unique benefits from very, very low driver turnover, safety results that were phenomenal just because less amount of traffic out on the road, no T&E. So we just got a lot of things. So we need to let this get by us before we really reassess that. But we're comfortable with our stated margins as they are right now. I think that's a good question. Of course, right now the demand is very high. It's a small niche industry. But exercise equipment in home is really strong right now. So we're seeing that grow appliances. As I said, my statement is very solid enough. Furniture is really coming back, strong, not back to where it was, but coming back strong. So we really see that final mile is going to have some good growth and excited about that the margin guidance, I think we're comfortable with what you said there that we'll see that so the demand is really good. The off-price retail that is our final mile is normally \u2013 it's okay during this time of the year. But it is really, really strong force at this point. So we hope that'll stay up there and continue. So that's good. And then the dedicated demand, we're still going with our 600 to 800 truck adds just what we think. We still love that model. I think the growth is going to be stronger next year once we get out of the pandemic, if people can start seeing this, because it is a big decision to replace the private fleet. It takes a while to sell it. I've always said 18 to 22 months, but it takes a lot of face-time to do that as well. And it's hard to do on Teams meeting or Zoom or whatever you're doing. So we're hitting \u2013 we've seen a little pause there. We've sold 430 trucks so far this year. And so hopefully that will pick up a little bit in the back half, again depending upon what the pandemics doing."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss some highlights with regard to our performance in Highway Services, which includes both our brokerage operations in ICS and our truck operations in JBT followed by showing some perspective that gives us increased confidence and the rollout of the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. Finally, I'll offer some thoughts on how we see the business continuing to evolve to solve the needs of our customers and create raving fans of the platform. First, as we stated at our Q1 earnings conference call, and John has alluded, we highlighted 2 key objectives for this most recent quarter: number one, taking care of and focusing on the health and safety of our people; and number two, serving and making sure we honor the commitments we have made to our customers. I am proud of the way our team and the organization responded to all the challenges, but we and our customers based in the quarter. With regards to the quarter market dynamics in Q2, we're unique to say the least, while we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our published business, spot opportunities for the most part were non-existent, and revenue was further pressured by rates or revenue per load versus a year ago. Additionally, while part of our strategy is to grow our penetration with small and medium sized shippers, I believe the segment of the market was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which also put pressure on some aspects of our business. Second, I'm extremely encouraged by the trends we're seeing in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360, which strengthens our confidence in the rollout of our platform. The trended data support our belief that customers and carriers are increasingly wanting to connect digitally. This enhances both visibility and transparency for both parties and we believe market adoption is continuing to build momentum, as evidenced by our shipments per day in the platform continued to grow at double digits versus a year ago. And what I would describe as a fairly challenging environment to grow volumes. I believe this is also supported by the level of engagement and activity that we see in the platform. When we talk about engagement activity, what are we really talking about? Well, we're talking about the number of available loads, number of load searches, number of offers, offers per load, number of carriers approved and activated, as well as users in the platform. In fact, all of the KPIs we tracked in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 over 75% of those KPIs hit all-time records in the quarter. As we continue to scale the platform, we have data to support that there's incredible value and efficiencies for both the shipping and carrier communities as they transact in the platform. Enhancing value and efficiencies for both shipper and carrier community very much aligns with our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. So we remain encouraged by the data, not only how it creates value for the market, but also in terms of the visibility provides to our team, and ensure that we utilize our own assets as efficiently as possible. As an example, we eliminated over 2 million new backhaul miles for both our JBI and DCS segments in the quarter, which exceeds what we've eliminated in all of 2019. This is just another example of how we see benefits across our organization from the platform. Now focusing on our investment in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. We remain committed to our investment targeted in 3 key areas: our people, technology; and scaling the platform. We believe our investments to continue at the current pace on both people and technology firms. We do not or we do expect to continue to gain efficiencies in the platform with automation, but also expect some of those efficiencies to be reinvested in our sales force to help build greater scale. Market dynamics will also play a significant factor in terms of our ability to scale. So we will have to see how the market evolves. But it is worth noting at this point scaling the platform is the primary opportunity and risk to achieving profitability by the second half of 2021. It is also worth noting that we remain committed to building out our 360box program, which falls in our JBT segment, as JBT continues to shift into more of an asset-light service offering. In closing, we continue to see both ICS and JBT as well as our DCS and JBI businesses growing and evolving to becoming even more complementary within the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. I'd now like to turn it over to Nick to talk about both Dedicated and Final Mile. I think the market's been difficult. Particularly, in the brokerage business, it has had wild fluctuations from a margin perspective, and then also was right in the middle of the kind of the last part of the bid process. So I think it's been difficult to estimate what margins would look like in the month much less putting in a full year price for customers. So we have seen really the front-half of the quarter to the back-half of the quarter prices did change from a bid process. And what customers are awarded volumes at, I would say it was more competitive in the first-half of the quarter versus the second-half of the quarter. And we've seen customers across our segments come back with more mini bid, and bids that weren't getting implemented or carriers weren't taking the volumes that were awarded. Those are coming back out in mini bids from a tighter capacity environment, really across the board in general. I would say we've seen some larger brokers, I think, defend their position, much like we would as well. So I don't think that anybody was ill behaved in the market. But I do think it's been a more competitive price environment from large incumbents and then from a digital freight perspective, I think that there's not a lot of change there. There's always been an aggressive mentality from a price perspective, with customers, but I don't think anything is different. I would say that as we have ended the second quarter and began the third quarter, that the margins are unsustainable inside brokerage, I would say, across the industry right now. So you're really seeing the supply demand tightness occurring. I think it's one of the most constrained environments I have seen. Obviously, we are in a pandemic, but I think that in this market, the number of turndowns that are occurring from customers, the challenges that are happening from a capacity perspective, and then the lack of margin, if you will, I think things if they were to continue as is, I think things will change in near-term versus long-term. I do think that brokerage as an overall is a great answer for our customers, it has gained market share over the last several years as a total as a percentage of total shipments that are happening. And it's because the flexibility and being able to be agile in price and capacity for customers, when surges in demand are happening. So I think that outlook is good. We just have to get through the near-term headwinds that are occurring in the business. Yes, I talked about that in my opening remarks that really scaling the business is an important component in our return to profitability. As we have created a level of investment right now that is should be able to scale really from here and depending on how quickly we can add revenue will depend on how quickly returned to profitability. In total, I am somewhat cautious as to what the second half will look like. But as Nick said earlier, we really don't have great forecasts from our customers as to what revenue is going to do or shipments are going to do. So I think it's too early to tell what would happen from that perspective. When I look at what's happened in both spot and published, I think that you saw inside the quarter spot revenue per shipment moved down substantially and then back up with a rebound in June. And so things were very different by month in the quarter in total, and published pricing really is at a low watermark that I think has room to move as carriers are pushing prices on a day to day basis from a brokerage perspective, I think, price will change at the customer view as well. There \u2013 before COVID, there was a change occurring and I talked about this in our Q1 earnings release call that January and December were both unusually and unseasonably tight in those weeks that I talked about. We've seen some of that emerge back here in June and continuing into July. So I think published pricing will move I think it is moving as we speak. And I know certainly, we're talking through with customers what that means when it comes to other business that they're talking to us about, and I'm certainly talking to others about as well. Yeah, I would say at the start of the quarter, we experienced what I would characterize as the high end of our margins, and at the end of June, we experienced at the low end of our margin. So the swing was significant throughout the quarter in total. I think, moving into July, there's been an even further tightening and there's evidence of that in reports around turndowns and what we've seen from an MDI perspective as well in the industry. So we're certainly feeling that impact from a price perspective at a spot capacity with carriers. So I would say it's probably tightest right now here in July. Yeah, I think right now, the back half of next year, we still have scheduled to return to profitability. But it will be \u2013 I talked about this in my opening remarks, we have redeployed resources that we've already seen efficiency in scaling the business operationally into our customer's side of the business. And so we have made investments in scaling their platform in technology and in people, and so holding those costs flat as we build revenue, each one of those as a percentage of revenue start to contribute more towards the bottom line. There is a revenue number that really takes us into a profitable state as an organization, and that will largely depend on how quickly we can get there. And if COVID has an impact more than what it has had really in April and May. I would say if the environment stays like it is right now, I still feel comfortable with the second half of 2021. But things have changed throughout the quarter. So it's very difficult for us to predict what's going to happen. So my opening remarks, I did talk about that the platform experienced double-digit volume increases. And so you think about how we're connecting with both shippers and carriers digitally, that means that connecting points happening through our technology, so that actually scaled in the platform. If I also mentioned what happened with spot volumes throughout the quarter, we have been growing and continued to grow in Q2, our committed contractual business with customers. So we call that our published business that business continue to experience good market share growth in those segments that was offset by what happened in the spot market in total. So both from a revenue per load and total shipment, we just could not overcome the last spot in both April and May. We did see that rebound in June and has continued to see that move forward in July. Well, I think the cautiousness comes as a result of just our experience what's happened here in Q2, if you recall our discussion points from the first quarter, we had a lot of caution as to what would happen in Q2. And I think that served us well, because each month was different than expectation. And I'm not even sure that we had good expectations from both our customers and also internally. So as we saw Q2 really go through a wild roller coaster ride, we aren't sure what's going to happen in Q3. I do think that volumes could continue to move up. But I think what Nick said earlier around what's happening with the pandemic, with cases rising, we just aren't sure what's going to happen to the end consumer. So it's just too difficult for us to say exactly what is going to happen. We really can speak about what's happening right now and the forecast for the next few weeks and past that our customers are struggling, knowing what's going to happen and certainly we are as well. Correct. Well, Brian, I think that's been the question for us really for the quarter. We had that question also in the first quarter of the tightening that was occurring from a supply perspective early on. We do think that possibly PPE and unemployment has had an impact from a supply perspective. I also think that, prices really fell in April and May. And there was a lot of frustration from a carrier community, because they live in a spot environment from a PTE perspective. And so, I think that some of those carriers chose to stay home and chose to do other work outside of the trucking industry until business came back or business was in a healthier state. And so, I think that could impact part of it as well. I would tell you, I think we're seeing signs of a change in the environment from a cost perspective that Darren talked about earlier. If that were to continue to occur, I think that's putting pressure on margins across the board. And we'll have to think about what that means over the longer term. Certainly, we'll be ready to handle that. But as we're working closely with our customers, to help our customers right now, one thing that's happening is business is out of balance. And so, we talked a little bit about what's happening on the West Coast. That's also happening throughout the country as there are different customers shipping right now in different lanes that are moving right now, that's causing a problem in the market as well. And so that problem we're working closely with customers. We want to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises of our customers. That's creating an environment also, from a spot perspective, that's constraining margins."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I thought I would focus my comments on 3 primary areas: performance in the quarter; an update on Intermodal pricing dynamics; and finally provide some thoughts on fluidity of our network as a whole. First, I'm extremely proud of the team's performance as they were able to react to significant demand swings from the start until the end of the quarter. Sitting here 3 months ago, we have little visibility into the outlook for the quarter, let alone the year, and to be honest, not much has changed as we sit here today. In April, we were experiencing meaningful declines in our business with expectations that conditions could further deteriorate based on expected port activity levels, availability of truck supply and lower fuel prices. That said we saw general improvement in volume trends as the quarter progress with the biggest surprise occurring in June. This is apparent with our monthly volumes which were down 6% in April, down 4% in May and positive 5% in the month of June. Feedback we received from customers was that sales trends were stronger than they expected as the economy began to reopen. And while we know there is a lot of focus on imports, we did not see a normal correlation between import data and our West Coast volumes. As it relates to pricing we discussed in our last earnings call, we would take a balanced approach to both volume and price during the bid season, and I believe we have executed on that strategy for 2020. At this point, we have completed pricing on approximately 80% of our published business with the remainder to implement in Q3. October 1 will begin a new pricing cycle. The rates we have \u2013 the rates have come in about where we would have expected, we finished Q2 at flat revenue per load excluding fuel on a year-over-year basis. Mix and stronger West Coast Transcon volumes are providing a lift to the revenue per load above what we would have anticipated. We have previously stated that we were very confident and we would outperform the general industry trends on volume. We based that thought on our awards from last year's bid process, which we will begin to lap in this third quarter. Given our pricing strategy this year, we do not anticipate a significant deviation from general industry trends, or at least not to the extent we experienced last year. The balance of our network continues to face significant challenges that I expect to become even more difficult in the third quarter. The reality of the mix of our current customer base is significantly stronger off the West Coast. We do expect we will have some cost pressure while we ship empty equipment to the West Coast that higher levels than we would have expected going into the year. Rail service has continued to hold up during the increase in volumes. As June volumes increased, we aren't experiencing the record level network rail service that occurred in March and April as volumes had declined. But as we have experienced a significant swing in demand, our rail providers have all worked strategically with us to solve for capacity challenges together with our rail providers, we understand the critical point in time to prove the value and strength of Intermodal as a solution with consideration for the massive capacity requirements. That concludes my remarks. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Shelley to discuss Highway Services. Okay, well, that was a predictable question. I'll get that out of the way right away. No, we haven't changed our long-term outlook on our margin target. That continues to be our target. From the volume perspective, yeah, I think in the earlier comments in the call, we were highlighting that while prices were coming in relatively in line with what we had expected going into the year, mix was contributing to benefit on revenue per load and our revenue per load was flat for the quarter. So pricing is not necessarily flat. Prices have been slightly negative. But the mix of our traffic is driving a benefit to that in keeping our revenue per load at a flat level. From a volume perspective, April was headed down rapidly. At the time we did this call back in mid-April we were seeing bookings. And feedback from our customers suggested that we were going to be really, really in \u2013 headed down. And by the end of the month, it did obviously kind of stabilize with I think we said negative 6% in April. At that point, you started with a lot of info on blanking of ships and import traffic really, really falling, and so we were concerned a lot about May and June. But as the quarter continued on, volumes hung in there. And then, as we got into June, really volumes were significantly stronger than we had anticipated. We did highlight that we're beginning to lap the comparisons against last year. Last year, at this time, during the third quarter, we had some nice gains in our volumes from \u2013 through the pricing cycles with customers. And we're going to begin to compare against that, so volumes being 5% up in June, as we highlighted earlier. Our volume run rate so far in July has been relatively in line with the same weekly volumes we're doing in June. But the comparison is certainly different. So the comp will get more and more difficult as we move through the third quarter on growth percent. Yeah, Justin, I don't think I can really give any kind of guidance on volume moving forward. I would say, it's very clearly our expectation to grow with the market. At a minimum, we expect to maintain our market share and feel confident in our ability to do that. That's probably about as much as I can say about volumes moving forward at this point. Historically, I think with \u2013 the length of haul is so much different between truckload and intermodal. There are times that the truckload price might dip further than in intermodal. But at times when prices are climbing, the inverse is true. The truckload price is climbing further as a percentage simply because it's a smaller revenue per load. I don't know that how to forecast next year. I do think that in the current environment, as we sit here today, July 16, it feels like we have some cost pressure coming at us. And so, I would expect that prices will have some \u2013 we'll be talking to customers about cost pressures, certainly, the railroads will have something to say about their cost challenges. And we'll all be talking more about that and learning more. I know John had highlighted in his comments, we're cautious right now in this environment. We just don't \u2013 it's hard to see 3 months, 4 months from now, much less next year in that pricing cycle. But as we sit here today, I do think that we're all feeling some challenges on the cost front headed our way. Sure, okay. Well, I don't know that I think our ability to that demurrage on box time at customers and detention billing, whether it's a rail loan piece of equipment or private and the different philosophies amongst all the different providers for intermodal has a lot to do with it. I think over our experience with our customers, I'd like to believe we have proven ourselves as a high-quality service provider. We have \u2013 we do have a large fleet of containers and we certainly have been \u2013 have relationships with a wide variety of customers. And that lend itself well to us in June. We were positioned with equipment in the right markets. When we needed the equipment it was right there for us and available to help our customers with their demand. Just the data around imports and port activity compared to our \u2013 even the domestic intermodal business as a whole, just we haven't been able to figure out a direct correlation as to how that looked in June. It just feels like there was a little bit of a disconnect. Demand certainly seemed higher than what the import data would have suggested. I don't know if that is pent-up demand from equipment at ports or if it's simply there was more inventory in the West Coast warehouses. I'd have to ask customers to help determine that. But at the end of the day, I think our customers trusted us and gave us the opportunity for a strong business in June, from all the years of experience we've had working with those customers. Well, certainly, with the overall second quarter being at negative 2%. If we can get our volume back to something north of 2%, I would expect the turn number in the third quarter to look better. I mean, the turn number is going to be related to volume, in April and in May weren't very good in the quarter. So, from a box turns' perspective, I would expect a slight improvement. From a margin perspective, we've had \u2013 Nick highlighted in some of his comments, we had very successful quarter on the safety front that was effective for us and helped us on the margin front. We had low driver turnover that helps us on the margin front. We were able to use our drayage assets at a higher percentage. And we dipped into some of the outsourcing we do in that area. That's beneficial to our margin. We do still need price to really move and help and improve margin. But if \u2013 just on a sequential perspective, I think that I highlighted that the network balance in Q3 I think is actually going to become a larger challenge for us in Q3 than it was in Q2. For a lot of the first half of the year, we were positioning our equipment into the market, where we expected volume to return. And so, we had equipment already in California. We had equipment in the Midwest, in Chicago, where demand began to come back faster. Well, as the network is running today, we're going to be moving more empty equipment. And not all of our customers are back at the same pace. And that's creating a little bit of a hard prediction of the network impact from balance. But I expect in Q3 to actually be more challenged on the network balance than we were even in Q2. Well, we just aren't going to comment on the expectation of the margin in the next quarter. So at this point to grow capacity for Intermodal would require \u2013 you're going to place a container order with a manufacturer, there aren't a lot of manufacturing opportunities located here in North America. So if it is as much about the opportunity to produce and provide the transportation for the containers into the country in a timely enough manner to assist in certainly this year. We are trying to be more balanced in \u2013 or we are trying to be balanced in both volume and price as we've been talking about for really several quarters now. And our margins need some improvement and so we're cautious on how quickly we want to go add capacity. At the same time, we're keeping a close eye on truckload capacity is there an opportunity to get back to a stronger growth trajectory for Intermodal in the Eastern network that would certainly drive some consideration and expanding our fleet and investing in more capacity. It will always, always, always be our goal to grow Intermodal, but we understand the return profile our shareholders expect, we expect and hold ourselves is to going to drive that decision first. Okay, so really, I mean the balance challenges come from the opportunities for growth and the rate of shipping from our customers. I mean, there was a significant lift in West Coast demand to come eastbound, which are predominantly imported cargoes. The cargo that's going westbound is going to be food products and consumer products to support the large population basis on the West Coast. So, the realities are it's just \u2013 it's been driven mostly from import goods that may be consumer behavior and that the high sales from some of various retailers. And that's what's driving the balance challenge. From a \u2013 when we talk about balance challenges too, we're a growth organization. We're always going to try to grow. We want to grow. That's our goal every minute of every day. So you're not going to grow with balance. So I don't expect this to be balanced. But I do expect the ability to improve on the network from where we were a year ago. In this year, in this particular kind of very odd time, that's been more difficult then. But I view that more as an outcome of the pandemic and kind of the odd state of consumers and the way our shippers or the patterns that our shippers are moving in."

            "content": "Thanks, Brad. The second quarter has confirmed the comprehensive nature of the virus throughout the period. As noted, we immediately committed ourselves to the priorities of taking care of our people, and delivering on the promises we have made to our customers. We are encouraged with our results in both areas through the second quarter. More than 75% of our employee base has been unable to work from home due to the nature of our business and the ongoing needs of our customers. The safety practices and PPE supplies we deployed early and have continued to support and provide have proven substantially effective to date. We review both external and internal COVID-related data daily. We will continue to monitor the situation and maintain focus on these important priorities. Additional facility investments have been and are being made to all work areas in Lowell and across the country to help lower risk. Equally rewarding has been the recognition and encouragement from so many of our customers and acknowledging the performance of our people, particularly our drivers for providing consistent service and availability, moving freight to where it is needed. We stand ready and able to continue to serve them and their ultimate customers. Another important discussion that has developed during the second quarter is about inclusion and diversity. While this is not a new topic here at J.B. Hunt, the level and quality of dialogue has elevated in recent weeks. I can report that the entire executive leadership team is actively engaged in understanding where we are and determining where we want to go and improving these vital elements through all levels of the company. I will again recognize and thank the amazing employees of J.B. Hunt for their remarkable efforts to stay together, strong, safe and reliable over the past quarter. There is no quit in our people. Our field operators, drivers, maintenance technicians, along with our support teams in the field and in Lowell have remained vigilant and true to our mission. We are extremely proud of the entire organization. John Kuhlow will comment on our current financial situation. And as an enhancement to this call, our segment leaders will address the performance and trends in each of the business units. I will focus my remarks in the macro-view we have today across the top of the business. Clearly, we are off our original plans in many respects. And comparisons to last year do not help illuminate much about where we find ourselves. What we do know is that during the quarter we saw a stable and steady cadence of demand, particularly, in our Dedicated and Intermodal businesses, and even see some of the disruption in our Highway Services brokerage and truckload, signaling a similar upward slant to the demand curve, albeit difficult on near-term margins. At Final Mile, business lines are slowly, but surely working their way back online. Finally, our need to hire more drivers as an indication of what we hope is a bottom in the cycle. This is particularly encouraging in that we have experienced some of the lowest driver turnover ever in the past 4 months. While still too early to call, at least we have some potential signs of inflection in the demand curve. We will look for more direction from import data, inventory levels and retail sales information, as well as thoughtful input from our customers to build confidence in the trends into the second half of the year. Until that confidence firms, we maintain our current state of cost control efforts, a conservative capital expenditure approach, and contain payroll and hiring practices. We have restarted some strategic discussions around growth channel prospects, particularly in areas where we anticipate potential demand-driven rate-supported needs to expand fleet sizes, implementing new dedicated and final mile contracts as sales come back online, and positioning for new investments in technology, all in early stage preparation for what we hope is the inevitable return to normalcy. Having said all that, we are cautious. Recent COVID cases count expansion and the uncertainty of what that may present will drive us to hold back for now on any directional changes from the current state of conservative thinking. And again, we will maintain the priorities of keeping our people safe and striving to honor the commitments we have made to our customers going forward. With that, let me turn it over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts. John? Hey, Stephanie, as you're building the queue, just a reminder to everybody, one question and one follow up please just in for time sake. Well, I'm surprised, Ravi, I don't know how to characterize my thought on that. In a global pandemic, I guess, I just don't know what would have surprised us, or what we would have expected any more than what did happen. I mean, the networks are all busy today. I'm certain we have competitors that experience a lift in their volumes as well. I mean, the whole entire system is moving more business in the back-half of June than it certainly was in April and May. Yeah, it's 11% to 13% is where we're at. And that that kind of guidelines that we try to bounce around in between and it's affected a lot. If we have a lot of startups, sometimes it gets a little thinner. But a lot of factors go into that, but that's our target. It is \u2013 what's going to happen in the next 2 or 3 months with the pandemic then I can probably help you on that. But I really don't know, I don't know what the volume is going to do with our customers were very agile, but if it was normal times maybe I could give you a better prediction. But I'm just nervous about what it's going to do with all the COVID cases coming back up and all those things, I don't know if they're going to shut business now. It's just affecting different industry at different way. So I really wouldn't feel comfortable addressing the next couple of quarters. Hey, Stephanie, we've got time for one last question. Thank you. Thank you, all of you, for your participation today. I think we've had some good discussion here. I'd like to say I'm really proud of our leadership team. This is a very experienced group of people. We really have seen a lot of different conditions in different markets through different cycles. And I know that we are talking a lot about the future state of during and after the pandemic. What the demand changes will be in areas for our core businesses and what demand changes will present in new opportunities for us in technology and e-commerce and I things that \u2013 feel like they're going to be a part of our conversation. I think the quarter did present some positives. But I think the cautious tone that you hear from us is that we just still don't have enough longer-term data to say this is how we feel that you can sort of rely on of what we're looking for. But we are talking and watching carefully. So know that it's a very active discussion. We're still waiting to see that confidence firm up and we'll obviously keep you posted. On the questions around margin dynamics, obviously, we discussed those questions. And again, we're just not in normal times. So let us have enough to kind of see what our normal cycle, normal demand will look like and we'll be able to have more thought on that going forward. Yeah. The last thing I would say is that we continue to be very highly integrated as an organization. That's both with our people and with our customers. Several comments throughout this hour have been around that sharing of data, sharing of people, working with customers and really finding ways to continue to deliver on those promises. So I think that's important. When you look at J.B. Hunt, I think, you have to think about the whole package. We appreciate your [indiscernible] interest and that we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] A replay will be made available after today's call on the company's Web site at jbhunt.com. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Brad Delco, Vice President of Finance, and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrad Delco: Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Hopefully, everyone has had an opportunity to review our earnings release that was issued earlier today. If not, you should be able to access the release on the Investor section of our Web site at jbhunt.com.Before I introduce the speakers on today's call, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B. Hunt's current plans and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.With that out of the way, I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; John Kuhlow, our Interim CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, and SVP of Finance; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer, and President of Highway Services; Nick Hobbs, our President of Dedicated; and Darren, our President of Intermodal.At this time, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Okay, thank you, Brad. Continuing with our format of opening remarks, let me start by thanking the J.B. Hunt teams around the country for the tireless commitment and hard work that has occurred and will continue in response to the conditions we've faced during this pandemic, and in particular, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifice of our driving forces and our maintenance teams. We have had virtually full staff show rates every day. As you all know, drivers and maintenance teams cannot work remotely. Lastly, I wish to recognize the work of all office personnel in making a swift and effective adjustment to remote-style work to support our drivers and customers. On behalf of the leadership team, we greatly appreciate you all.Obviously our commentary on this quarter and the balance of this year will be disrupted by the impact of the COVID-19 situation in many ways. Please be advised that senior management across the company meets via conference twice daily on all macro issues relating to staffing, human resources' safety, and customer dynamics to stay very current and agile. We clearly cannot predict the timing or depth of the coming cycles, but by covering this data frequently we do get a sense for direction and potential magnitude of change. Our views on the current situation include focus on capital deployment, margin recovery, cost saving levers, prior recession performance, recent weekly-monthly performance trends, cash flow generation, CapEx projections, balance sheet strengthening and liquidity preservation, portfolio exposure, and recovery trends. We will touch on these topics and others as we review our work with you today and in the coming calls we will have.In all, we see the environment showing near-term disruption and turbulence, but expect the longer-term to present opportunities to capitalize on many of our existing priorities, including our efforts with 360, our Final Mile and private fleet outsourcing businesses in both our Highway Services and Intermodal. We're evaluating several categories of internal and external data to better understand the slope and timing of the import activities that will impact our Intermodal networks, which Darren will comment on during discussion. We're also studying market information to help us estimate how the domestic freight trends will move in the coming weeks and months.As mentioned, we are working remotely where possible, which include above 90% at our corporate campuses, and approaching 50% in our field locations. We are pleased to report that recent investments in strengthening all aspects of our technology infrastructure and resiliency have delivered the results needed. Our ability to stay connected with each other, our customers, and our drivers has kept us fully operational.In addition to our traditional workflows, the positioning of our digital freight management platforms, known as 360, is enabling a different type of response to fast-changing needs by our people, customers, and carriers. A recent expansion to the baseline connectivity we had been reporting on, we are currently testing a comprehensive electronic bill of lading program to capture needed proof of delivery and signatures in a no-touch environment. This option will be available to all carriers and customers in early May. Shelley will cover some of the details for us here. This is a good example of our continuing development in 360.The comprehensive nature of our transportation offerings create many benefits to our customers. In addition to those long-held advantages, we are seeing that our broad reach of services presents us with options to reallocate our assets and people. As noted, we are seeing declines in some channels with surges in others.There are several options available to us in the way we handle the demands from our customers in Intermodal, DCS, Truckload, and ICS. During our discussion today, we will call out some examples of how we are providing resources within and across -- I'm sorry, pivoting resources within and across segments.A new element of our presentation includes the breakout of Final Mile Services. Lastly, we provided some historical data to help get you acclimated to the trends in this offering. Of all our business lines, this one has been hit the hardest in our ability to relocate assets, drivers, and contractors due to the nature of the equipment and services provided. Nick will be able to provide more information on our near-term expectations for Final Mile. While the environment we are in will make it difficult to effectively model this business in the near-term, we are hopeful that at least you can get more familiar with our recent trends. Even in the current turbulence, we have seen nothing that changes our strategic direction in any area of the company. In fact, we are encouraged by our positioning, and while we plan to be thoughtful about discretionary cost controls in the near-term, our long-term plans and expectations have not changed meaningfully.At this time, I'll ask John Kuhlow to make some comments on our current financial state, and then Brad will close up our planned remarks, opening for questions following that. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the team is going to cover specific on the segment results. So, I'd like to provide some comments on our approach to addressing the pandemic during the quarter and more importantly, going forward. We obviously entered the first quarter of 2020 with a very different expectation and what ultimately transpired. While the pandemic offers a level of uncertainty not seen in many years, J.B. Hunt is essential to the recovery, and our focus remains consistent, which is to sell for our customer's needs.We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Our target leverage ratio is one times EBITDA, which is where we landed at March 31. We're not afraid to go above this target in the near-term if conditions warrant, and we have the credit resources to do so. We ended the quarter with approximately $48 million in cash, and we currently have zero drawn on the revolver, which has $750 million of borrowing capacity, and an option to take that up to $1 billion. We remain confident in our ability to access cash, given the strength of our banker, and we maintain close communication with that group. In addition, we intend and expect to emerge from the current economic environment with our investment grade rating intact.With respect to cash flow generation, outside the risk of declines in the freight market, we view our largest risk going into the second quarter around our customer's liquidity and ability to pay. We monitor working capital on a daily basis and are in frequent communication with our customers and providers. We're beginning to see an increase in certain customers reaching out to discuss liquidity concerns, and while we understand their liquidity issues, we have to enforce our terms that we have agreed to. Our carriers and suppliers expect us to pay according to returns, and we must expect the same from our customers.From a capital deployment standpoint, our approach remains the same. We invest in our people and business growth, we will maintain our working capital and leverage positions, return value to shareholders through dividends, and we'll continue an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. This has been our focus and will remain so for the long-term. Although, we certainly recognize the current environment, but believe our framework allows us to make discretionary adjustments to this approach as needed.In the near-term, we are reprioritizing some of our 2020 spend to essential and critical items. We're evaluating expenditures based on those that must happen, those that can be deferred, and those that are capable of being cancelled, but we have example with plans to expand a terminal facility in our Southwest region during the second quarter to accommodate long-term growth beyond our 2020 needs. However, in light of the current state, we have paused this project until we are in a more predictable environment. Further, our opportunistic buyback approach allows for discretion based on liquidity needs at the time. So, while we have historically planned for excess cash to be used for buybacks, we may have to hold the cash at the interim.Additionally, while we continue to evaluate the market for M&A opportunities, any potential transaction will still follow our normal evaluation process, which considers liquidity and funding requirements. Today, cost reduction actions have consisted mostly of canceling non-essential travel, pausing hiring activities, and delaying other discretionary spend, which we will continue to do so as needed. It's difficult to determine the specific impact the pandemic has had on our revenues and costs. However, we have identified approximately $15 million of specific costs in the first quarter that were not planned going into the quarter. The largest of which was our special bonus for approximately $12 million, as we noted in our release.Considering our cost structure, a large portion of our costs are varied. Our purchase transportation expense, which represents nearly 55% of our cost, is heavily tied to loads. Our next largest cost item is salaries and wages, which includes driver pay. Well, driver pay is mostly a variable cost, you can expect to see less variability in the near-term due to increases in paid time-offs for quarantined employees and offsets to reduce pay due to slowdowns. Today, we have not made adjustments to our costs that are considered more fixed in nature. However, we are carefully monitoring the environment, and are prepared to adjust if necessary.Lastly, with respect to CapEx, we've paused or canceled certain CapEx that was originally planned for 2020 that we view as non-essential in the near-term. This includes delaying or canceling orders for tractors, containers, and trailing equipment, where appropriate. However, keep in mind that not all of this is under our control as we're at the mercy of our suppliers. To the extent manufacturers have production slowdowns as a result of the pandemic we may need to adjust our CapEx accordingly. We previously provided our 2020 CapEx forecast to be between $675 million to $700 million. Our current view for CapEx due to the factors noted is now in the range of $575 million to $600 million. This is roughly $425 million to $450 million of maintenance, and the remainder is growth or success-based CapEx.And Brad, that covers my prepared remarks.\nBrad Delco: Okay, great. And just to briefly follow-up on John Roberts and John Kuhlow's comments, I thought it'd be worth providing a little more detail in investor speak with regards to the quarter, and what challenges and opportunities we see ahead in what is likely to be a dynamic freight market.In our Intermodal business, we've talked about network imbalances for several quarters, and that trend continued with weaker imports into the West Coast. In some instances, we had stronger demand in backhaulings relative to headhaulings, which puts pressure on revenue per load metrics, as well as network fluidity. We anticipate network imbalances to continue, as well as volume pressure from both demand trends and competitive pressures, particularly in the East with declining truck rates, and lower fuel prices. We continue to monitor the flow of goods out of Asia in order to most effectively planned capacity needs on behalf of our customers, and because we're anticipating the question, we will go ahead and knock it off the list and provide our Intermodal volumes by month. January was plus seven, February was plus eight, and March was plus five. That said, we did see a more meaningful drop off in volumes in late March, which has continued thus far into April.In Dedicated, this business was built to withstand the severe ebbs and flows of demand cycles, and we acknowledge that we may have an opportunity to prove the strength of our model in the near future. That said, we should all recognize that DCS is not 100% immune to economic cycles, and we will see some impacts to the business that I'll let Nick discuss in more detail during Q&A, but in short, we feel confident in our ability to service our customers with the high level of service they've come to expect from J.B. Hunt, and that couldn't have been more pronounced than what we saw in Q1.In ICS, investments into building out the digital platform will continue, and we remain focused on investments in three areas: people, technology, and scaling the platform. As you should expect, gross margins will fluctuate based on the relationship between supply and demand in the markets we serve. Clearly that relationship was challenged in Q1. Our focus here remains on executing for our customers and creating raving fans for the digital platform. The business leaders will be able to share how the platform helped drive additional revenue as well as mitigate costs and their respective segments during the vital freight market we experienced in Q1.In Final Mile Service, this is an area where we're seeing the most impact to our business with certain customers shuttering operations. This business is normally seasonal with Q1 results usually the most challenged. While Q2 and Q3 are typically the strongest, it seems likely that we will not see normal seasonality in the business this year, suggesting losses may accelerate in Q2.In truck, the business continues to move towards a more asset-light model. As a result, you should see a trend towards a more variable cost structure that would see similar performance dynamics as a brokerage model. While we are investing less capital in physical assets, namely power equipment, we continue to invest in our trailing fleet as well as technology that should enable this business to evolve and become even more complimentary with the 360 platform.This concludes my remarks. Given the number of questions we already seen in queue, I would ask that each analysts ask one question and one follow-up, and then return to queue. So, Nicole, with that, we'd like to open the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, great, thanks and good afternoon, guys. I guess maybe starting on the Intermodal side, Brad, thanks for the helpful color on loads per month in the commentary around April. I guess I know it's difficult to answer the question, but if you think about sort of the pace of what we've seen through the first two weeks of April, can you really give us some sense of what the magnitude of the drop-off might look like so far, and I guess in addition to that, when you think about Intermodal, maybe a little bit of color on sort of the percentage of the customers that may still be sort of operating and maybe what's kind of shut down as it stands currently?\nDarren Field: Okay. This is Darren. So, we obviously knew this question would be early on. So, when we came out of March, there was an impact to import volumes on the West Coast as a result of the slowdown of exports from China or the China side of a slowdown based on what was going on in China. As we've come out of March and we're in to April, we're experiencing meaningful declines in volume probably to tune of mid to high single digits. As we get into what we're learning about the future, we don't have visibility into what probably the back half of May and June represent, but certainly for the next three to four weeks I would expect that trend to continue. And just my opinion and my opinion alone, I mean I would expect that the volumes in Intermodal to be in the double-digit negative for the quarter.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears a little bit to the ICS side, and trying to just understand the strategy around 360 as we go through this process of turbulence over the next several weeks or months, I guess, depending on how long it lasts, are there toggles on the spending that we might see come through this where you'll preserve liquidity and sort of hold off on some projects that you wanted to -- or investments you wanted to make. How do you think about that in the context of what's going on with COVID?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, so just as a reminder for us. Our investment was really in three areas that Brad alluded to. We have focused on our people side, which I think we have done a good job watching our people costs as we came through March, and are even watching that coming in to April. We also invested in the technology spend, and those projects are not one or two-month projects; those are projects that are planned out over a longer period of time. And those projects we believe are critical in helping us create a more efficient transportation network. That is our focus. We will continue that plan from a technology spend and have confidence based on some of the data that we're seeing from both customers and carriers.Finally on the scaling part of the process, that was really an acceleration of our shipments and revenue plan with our customers and with carriers. And as those are onboarding our ability to know exactly which customer or carrier should be connected at which time was really the risk that would happen and the association to that. For us, coming though COVID-19, we really -- if you think about what we invested in total, we invested about 77% in our scaling of the business. That was about 35% over planned. I talked about on the first quarter earnings release that January was constrained on the supply side and unusual activity the first two weeks, and that created pressure from a margin perspective -- unexpected in January. February did come to more normal, and then certainly March had the most pressure on it from a margin perspective in total. So from our plan, we did a nice job from a people perspective being better than plan in total, offset by worse margin and a slight miss to our revenue plan in total.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much for the time, appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Justin Long with Stephens Inc.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. Maybe to follow up on Intermodal, you addressed the volume side, but I'm curious how you're thinking about Intermodal pricing in this environment from a strategic standpoint. Do you see the downturn as an opportunity to leverage the scale and structural advantages of the network and maybe get a bit more aggressive on price to take share, or given Intermodal margins are below targeted levels going into this downturn what would you say you're more focused on trying to hold the line on price going forward, just curious how you're thinking about that balance over the remainder of this bid season?\nJohn Kuhlow: Well, Justin, I mean you used the term, \"Balance,\" and that's exactly how we think about it. I don't believe we have any one specific game plan out there that says based on the downturn of the demand for shipping we need to go take share. That's not necessarily our approach. Would we be opportunistic with customer opportunities when that business is something that would be beneficial to our network? Absolutely, but I would think we would have been equally opportunistic with that opportunity had we not been in any kind of a downturn. So I don't want to -- I would not suggest that we have changed our philosophy. Certainly we are communicating with our rail providers regularly, and when the opportunity exists, if it ever did, and we could look at reduce our cost in some manner that allowed us to offer a little bit more aggressive pricing where it wasn't about a margin sacrifice then we would certainly look to do that. And those -- again, all of that happens one customer, one proposal at a time.\nJustin Long: Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, maybe following up on the comment that John made in the prepared remarks around the risks from customers' liquidity, is there a way to think about the percentage of your customers or percentage of revenue that you view as a risk on that front? And maybe, Nick, we could kind of hear from you in terms of the mix of DCS business, how it breaks down by end market and the size of those customers as we think about that risk.\nShelley Simpson: So we have evaluated what part of our customers move essential and nonessential goods in total and by segment. And our concern around the customer base in total, we have had communication with some customers that are having good conversation and calling us. Our bigger concern are customers that we're not hearing from, and so that has been, over the last several weeks, a main objective of our sales organization to really lean in and work closely with customers. We are having regular conversation daily with our customers just to make sure that we're staying on top of that. I do think it's a risk, but I do think that we're talking to customers on a regular cadence, and so far I don't see any surprise there.\nNick Hobbs: Yes, and so far as our mix of business, I think you clearly see, particularly once this pandemic hit us, our flexibility to move assets around from some of our customers that were more impacted than other, essential versus nonessential, some of our retail apparel, those segments were down 11% or so, but food was up 16%, home improvement 21%, office furniture was just falling off basically, and some automotive suppliers was down as well. Our Ag was very consistent. So, we've got a very diverse portfolio. And you're going to continue to see that as we move forward. And so we were able to move some of those segments around for the -- they may have been shut down or they may be slow, we were able to move over -- on an average we've moved about a thousand trucks a day from their base accounts over to others.So, within Dedicated, we've repositioned any assets that where the customers have been slow over to where our customers are very, very busy. And again, that's something when you operate as a private fleet you struggle with, you don't have another outsource. But that's the advantage that we bring to a lot of private fleets. They have the same control and service with us and great visibility with the flexibility to move some assets.\nJustin Long: And then on -- just to follow-up, Nick, on the terms and payment and that kind of thing in your business, are you seeing similar dynamics to what Shelley is seeing?\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I would say we would see more -- we see the same. When I get over into Final Mile we're a little on the furniture side. Those are more dramatically impacted so the volume on the furniture folks is up a little bit more.\nJohn Kuhlow: And I just want to emphasize too that the conversation that we're having with customers is very objective and crisp around how we, as John said, how we are set up pay our vendors. So when we get in to talking through extending terms, it's really not conducive in this line of work as it might be in others, but for us it's not really something we're supporting right now, and now getting good response.\nShelley Simpson: Yes, I would just add, I think our customers understand the necessity of us keeping our drivers and maintenance employees there on the frontline ready for our customers. That has been viewed favorably from them. As well as we did change our payment terms for the carry community from a truckload space. So anyone that moved a shipment in Carrier 360 in the month of March, we have moved up their payment days to only pay in seven days. So we're trying to get them cash more quickly. We've explained all of that to our customers. They've been very receptive so far. We're just trying to be offensive, be in front of it, and make sure that they understand what we're doing to help.\nJustin Long: Great, that's all really helpful. I really appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: All right, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, want to start with you, Darren. Is bid season still happening and maybe can you share some of the results that you're seeing? And then if volumes are down in the second quarter double-digit, so year-over-year it's -- I guess it's down double-digit sequentially as well. What does -- any way to help us think about the margin sensitivity there and how much margins can be under pressure?\nDarren Field: So, okay, I'll answer the bid season question. Certainly bid season is ongoing. We have had -- we, really prior to a lot of people from the world going to work from home, we had completed pricing on about a third of our business, maybe a little bit more than that, and that the results of that first [indiscernible] were probably about what we had expected them to be before any of this challenge to the economy had taken place. While we for the last four weeks, we have a handful of customers that are -- have exercised a bid, they've received results, but they're not in a good spot to implement that bid and they've delayed the start of it. Some of those have communicated maybe a delay. An example would just be a May 1st to a June 1st delay in new pricing. Some of the customers have effectively said, \"We will delay indefinitely until we can give you a different answer.\"We have a handful of customers that are asking us to go faster, and in those cases the reason they're going faster is they're actually -- they're shipping demands may actually be increasing for the second quarter, and they're looking to secure capacity and know that they've got the ability to do that. So for the most part, I would say that we have the -- the bid season has been what I would have expected it to. Now, every year we may price a project work for a host of different customers that are heavily involved in spring activities, and some of those kinds of projects may just not occur this year in Q2. So there's shipment volumes historically that are probably -- frankly they're just not going to ship, they're not going to happen. It's now to push off the business into the third quarter or just the activity that won't exist. And so, there's a little bit of a slowdown in that world, but that's not a huge percentage of what we do. In terms of sharing margin impact from a lack of -- from weaker volumes, certainly what we've talked about in the past is the price affects our margin more significantly that just the fixed cost or a lack of utilization of our assets. And that still remains true. However, having idle containers looking for work to do is impactful. The network fluidity or the balance of our system is significantly different than what we have believed is normal over the last 20 years.So the West Coast volumes that we move to the East are some of the longer length of haul and some of the higher rated business. So that volume has slowed more than other, and at the same time we have business from the Midwest, from the interior of the country for consumer products to support the population base on the West Coast that has surged up a little bit. So, you've got an increase in volume at in backhaul lanes and a loss of volume in headhaul lanes, and that that's impactful. So, I'm not going to answer your question specifically about a direct impact to the margin, but we have challenges there certainly as anyone would with the decline of volume.\nScott Group: Okay, and then for Nick, so when you talk about repositioning trucks in Dedicated from guys that are shut to guys that are open, I guess who pays for that, and then, to the extent that you have customers that are not operating right now and you can't reposition those trucks, do they still pay you right now, or I'm not sure how that works?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. Well, first of all, in Dedicated, all of our trucks are working. So, we've got them all moved around. They're supporting Intermodal in some places, but in other accounts, it's the other account that is surging up, they're looking for equipment, and so, we bring in other Dedicated. So, example, our grocery businesses, we serve probably nine or 10 different grocers. Our business is very, very robust, and so, basically can't handle it, and if they're up 16%-20%, we'll bring those trucks in from other accounts, and so, the account that is busy is the one that pays for them, and then we give a credit back to the other account, where if they had a private fleet, they'd be paying that driver pay and the cost of that equipment, and so, that's all set. So that's how that works.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you for the time, guys.\nNick Hobbs: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi, everyone. Just a question on Dedicated, can you talk a little bit -- yes, I think you alluded to it, maybe I missed some of that, on the -- and maybe it's hard to get a gauge for sure of your thoughts on truck adds to that business as we go through this year, given all the uncertainty, but maybe another way to think about it is, you know, going into the year, you're presumably talking to some new potential accounts, new potential business, have you seen it adding in instead of closing opportunities right now, or could you give any color on that? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Yes, I will do that. I will just tell you that we were off to a really good start. In Q1, we signed contracts on 350 plus trucks. So, that's a very good quarter for us. We signed our last deal just a couple of weeks ago. With that being said, as we kind of look ahead, it's hard to get meetings, we're trying to do some teams meetings, Microsoft, Zoom you name it, but those are slowing down, customers have other priorities right now. So, we're seeing our verbal slow down just a little bit, and we expect that to continue just a little bit. If you look back at the recession in '08-'09, our sales went down by about 20%. So, I think it's probably pretty good to assume that that's pretty close to what will happen here. So, I think we gave a guidance of 800 to 1,000. So, it could be 600 to 800 on sales, but also during the recession, the way our model works is our customers long-term, they need to take a truck or two out, we see a lot of pressure on our fleets to downsize a little bit, and so, we'll take some of those out. We look at it for the long-term with the customer, and we'll take some of those out. So with that, our net adds may not be as robust this year as they have been in the past two or three years, but the demand is still out there for private fleets, and we still got a full pipeline, but we just think there's going to be a little pause till we come out of this, and then we'll pick back up again.\nJordan Alliger: Got it, and then just a question, real quick question on the accrual, the $8 million, I'm assuming that time is up the loose ends, and it's related to 2019, and it's just in the one quarter and now that sort of put the bet at this point.\nJohn Kuhlow: So, well, actually, we received the award at the end of 2019. I think we announced that on October 30. As we implemented that award and went through the first month or two of this year, we understood that we needed to true up the payment for how much we paid BNSF in 2019, and that's what that announcement was about. It was actually related to the entire calendar year for 2019.\nBrad Delco: And, hey, Jordan, this is Brad. I did want to clarify kind of Nick's response to it because I do think it's important. So, essentially, Nick said, originally truck sales of 800 to 1,000 this year, he thinks that sales process could see a 20% decline from his original estimates, but customers do have some optionality to shrink the size of their fleet, and so, net adds could be something slightly below that, but that's an opportunity where we see where we can take equipment that's already in the Dedicated fleet and repurpose those to some of these new awards, and that's some of the comments that John Kuhlow provided in terms of why you're seeing some flexibility in our capital budget. So, I just thought that would be worth highlighting there.\nJordan Alliger: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon, everybody. Appreciate the remote balance. So, may be John or Brad, just to follow-up on that, the CapEx discussion there, you've talked about some canceled container and tractor orders, can you talk about the new CapEx guidance, what level of growth of assets are you now targeting? I don't know if you want to talk by segment or maybe just walk us through how you get that, what the reduction and what your growth targets are? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes. So, Ken, this is John Kuhlow. Just to kind of clarify most of the -- we have the ability to cancel, but today, it's mostly timing or delaying those orders. So, until we kind of have a better sense of what our needs are, but to give you a little bit more deeper perspective on CapEx, we're probably at about $400 million or maintenance and by segment that's roughly $50 million for truck around 130 or Intermodal and 150 per DCS. Now, keep in mind that also includes what we include in the maintenance is our investments in the back office technology for the company, and that's still around $80 million to $90 million for the year. So that's how we get to the $4 million and then the rest is primarily Intermodal and Dedicated for any success base growth that we might have in those segments.\nKen Hoexter: Great, and then, can you just talk about the Final Mile now that you're breaking it out, can you maybe just delve into how asset like you're talking about moving around the assets. I just want to understand the flexibility as you have customers shutting the financial flexibility of that segment, what kind of losses, you know, the current and near term or is that just if you're not using it, you don't pay.\nJohn Kuhlow: So, okay, let me give some answers on that we have that basically broken down into three channels. The first channel is furniture, and that is probably 95% asset light. So when they shut down, we may still have some buildings and then some of those we build the customer for those buildings still ongoing. So it is multiple things there you look at, but then for the equipment, it's all contractors, so our contractors, we try to get them connected for paycheck protection to afford them and the direction of a bank to help them through this time, so that costs will go away.Then the second channel is retail replenishment. That's basically our off price retail, and they are basically all shut down right now they're non-essential, and so that's where we have some company drivers. And so, on that channel we have tried to outsource as much as we can, but we also have some different types of equipment in there that can't go do Intermodal or Dedicated work. So there's about 300 of them. And so, we've chosen to pay them so that when the retailer's come back online, we will be ready to go, and we expect when those off price retailers come back, the volume will be pretty good.And then on the appliance side, which is the third channel, those are up, those are essential. And so, we're still doing deliveries for them. In some areas there is just to the doorstep not inside, but in other areas it is still inside. That volume in general is down 10% or 15%, but it is still up and going. And that is 50-50 of company employees and non-asset on the appliance side. And so we were agnostic, and we'll pass both of them to a customer and let them pick and choose on how they do that.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, guys; thanks, Nick. Appreciate it. And we'll take an extra freezer if you're going.\nJohn Kuhlow: Okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks, and good afternoon everybody. I guess maybe, Nick, just to put kind of a bow on the overall Dedicated comments that you have, I think that -- I understand what you're saying about the reduction in the net adds, but can you help us think, you know, Darren gave some comments on his expectations for Intermodal volumes. I would think in 1Q, there was probably some benefit of the pantry stacking that was happening, how should we think about overall dedicated revenue, maybe on a year-over-year basis as we move into the second quarter and the rest of the year? And then the other question about the margin profile, you know, if we do see revenues decline, how would you expect the margins in the dedicated segment to hold up? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow: Great. I would just tell you that typically in Q2, we see a big spring surge for home improvement. And so that takes our volume up and our revenue up at some of those accounts. We haven't really seen that. We've seen a little bit, but not a lot, but what for I've kind of seen and what I've looked at is, we had a pretty good Q1, and our volume is still across the board very consistent and dedicated compared to Q1 of this year, and it's maintaining. Yes, it's been shifted around different customers, but we're not seeing that fall off any. So at this point, we feel good about our volume being about the same as what it was in Q1, but you would typically see our volume surge up some. Margins, I will still tell you that the margins 11 to 13 ought to be pretty good goalposts for us to hit, but again, there is a lot of moving parts, but I think we feel very comfortable with what we're saying at this point in Q2.\nTodd Fowler: Great, that's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, Shelley, I'd be curious to get your commentary on shipper behavior right now in the market. Are you seeing shippers thinking about modal change, more demand for one service versus the other? Obviously available truck capacity or more available truck capacity, I'm just curious kind of what the shipper response in the market has been changed [technical difficulty].\nShelley Simpson: Okay, I think that it is time that we have had a -- what I would call a crisis in the market. We tend to accelerate our relationship with our customers. And I would tell you, I feel like during this crisis, we are doing that very thing. I think John Kuhlow mentioned this in his opening remarks, but we're really focused on two key objectives here in the second quarter. The first one is taking care of our people, and making sure that that's first and foremost, that we're taking care of our people and each other. And the second one is meeting our customer's promises. And as a result of that, I will tell you, Todd, every customer needs something a little bit different. The customers that Nick talked about that are very robust right now in the grocery side. Those customers are really utilizing all of our services across the company, and we're bringing as much capacity as needed to help them I would say in nearly every segment, every service that we do business with other customers that are shut down, we're having a different conversation with them.To add on to what Darren said about bid season, I also think that probably 80% to 90% of our customers have stayed on the path of what they're doing from a bid perspective. The other ones are just in a wait and see environment. I think our mix of business is fairly healthy and thankfully for us, the customers that are doing well, we tend to do a lot of business with those customers as well. And I think that has helped us coming into this. I think our customers are open minded if we went back to any point in time that we had a downturn or pressure from a profit or revenue perspective at a customer level. They're very open-minded to doing business the most efficient way that we can do business together. So I would say every customer is pretty open-minded as to what we need to do and how we need to grow.Then lastly, I have seen our customers lean more into us wanting to do more business. If you look at just graphics maybe from a highway perspective, but this should pretty much be across the board, how we get the most business I would say small-to-mid sized customers. You see our largest customers, mid-to-large customers really doing much better during this kind of crisis than you see are small, even some medium and micro shippers. There's the customers that are either shut down or trying to work through the crisis and having a little more difficult time in total, and that too we're being more flexible with, they tend to be in our highway services. So for them, the price will be fluid, and if the market is going down, we'll be able to help them save money.\nTodd Fowler: Okay, sounds good. Thanks for the time everyone.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, thanks, good evening. Darren just wanted to ask you about real service expectations, because there're some pretty significant declines going on those networks, and I think maybe relative to the last couple years, there is more integration, more blending and balancing, so to speak within those service lines. So do you think that's going to have any impact on what you would expect from an Intermodal service perspective as they look at down volume 20% 30% in some cases?\nDarren Field: The Intermodal service we're experiencing in our network today, their capacity available and on time performance of the trains, is the best in my 25 year career. And I think that's probably because of their decline in volumes in certainly they implemented operating plans, many of them over the last three to four years that are working out and having some success, but yes, it is my belief that right now rail is the best we have ever experienced.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, this is a follow-up for Shelley on the brokerage side. With the volatility even beginning in a year, it does seem like there is a decent amount of competition. Is that really changed at all? As you've seen even more of that in the last couple of weeks on the way up and the way down, do you think there is going to be - this is going to trigger any sort of consolidation and how people really lean towards 360 in this environment. Is it driven the material benefit or anything you can really pinpoint would be helpful.\nShelley Simpson: And Brian, I would say I haven't seen any dramatic change from a competitive landscape. I think that's how we started the year. It is similar to that as we stand today. I do think that because the fragmentation of brokers, there are some brokerage companies that aren't doing as well, and so they are a lot more aggressive particularly in the spot environment. I have seen our customers really stay to the providers that they have selected already, whether it's asset or non-asset, so I haven't seen a huge fall off from published business or awarded business moving to someone else. I think from a consolidation perspective, I think it's been difficult from our brokerage perspective to weather the storm. If you think about the cyclicality of brokerage, we really started seeing the shift happened in 2019 as the market was correcting from a brokerage perspective, brokers are really changing the price while PTE was rising in total and that some of what I commented in December and January, the supply side starting to tighten, I think that part of the business will continue to have some push as we've moved into second quarter and PTE has had pressure on it downward because shipments aren't as plentiful. It comes down to how much can the price really change before that impacts the supply side of the equation, and then I think there could be consolidation as a result from both brokerage and from the carrier perspective.From a 360 perspective, we have gained more confidence through this crisis that our platform is actually helping us perform more agile and be very open and transparent about the data with our customers. What we have found is our customers are leaning in more to us from a total shipper perspective, I believe on the earnings release, we reported that our shipment count grew 44% in the platform, and that's a direct result of what we're doing in the truckload space. Our customers have also leaned into us from a 360 box perspective as they have started learning what we can do from a platform, really putting together the right truck on the right load at the right, they start to see that change their business in total, and that's how we started and why we started our 360 Box business. Our customers in Q1 leaned into that part of our model and we actually had a slight increase in revenue from our plan in Q1, we feel comfortable with that plan and the complementary nature between the drop and hook part of the business over the market, which is about half of the Tier market with the live load business, which is the other half of the market. We think that's part of the inefficiency that exists and when you put those two networks together, that we can create a more efficient network. Our customers are leaning into that and we feel comfortable about our growth plans in 360.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right, thanks for covering all that, Shelley. Appreciate it.\nShelley Simpson: You're welcome.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. So I wanted to see if you could offer some perspective. Perhaps John, just in terms of this cycle maybe compared to 2008, 2009, it seems like 2008, 2009 kind of the best comparison we have in terms of a sharp decline in freight. And your thoughts on how this might be, is that a good comparison? Is this likely to be similar or their reasons, it would likely be different. And I guess in particular within that, if we look at Intermodal performance, you did see some pressure on price and you saw some pretty considerable pressure on margin in 2009, but maybe it's a little different this time around. So appreciate any thoughts you have on that kind of cycle comparison?\nJohn Roberts: Yes, we spent some time going back and thinking about how we got into that recession, what the drivers were and then the results coming out of it. Nick and I had a good conversation today about what channels were open during that time that kind of closed down on us and how we sort of remodeled the portfolio, and that's really the time in DCS where we pointed our efforts more towards private fleets away from capacity management that doesn't completely take us out of the churn in the downturn and then the outcoming results from the recovery, but we think that we got a better view there and we will no doubt see some impact going in, but our approach on that side of the business is to serve the customer in every way that we can knowing that it's a long game and so we really stay away from and have benefited from not getting into short-term and our thinking or our approach really with any of our segments. On our trucking and highway business, I'm so much more encouraged and confident in that business because of all the work that's been done in everything from the geographies that we serve, the length of halls that we're in, the way we've set the equipment up, there's a lot more versatility there.So as far as going in to a downturn and then how we come back out, I think we'll be more nimble and more quick to be able to respond. When you own every truck and every trailer, there's only so much you can do and that can really put pressure on pricing and margins and performance that takes a long time to recover from, I think we'll see that differently coming out. On Intermodal, it's a good answer, going into a recovery, depending on pricing or has historically been, I think that fuels a big deal in Intermodal that can be a real plus or maybe not, not an event, and I think with low fuel prices and I expected they'll stay low for a while. So, we'll probably see that be a little different from the past. In total though, I really feel like we're in as good a position as we've ever been, our pricing approach is so much more rich and robust than it's ever been in the past. Our timing of response is so much better than it's ever been. I mean, we are coming from months to weeks now where we can see changes in the markets that we serve and are able to respond so much more quickly, and I predict that will even get better. I think the more data we get into our system the better we're going to be able to respond as we start to come out of what would be considered I guess a downturn. That's what we're expecting anyway. I don't know if you guys want to add anything to that?\nShelley Simpson: I would say, I think that the level of data that we have that John talked about has grown exponentially. And today we use that data primarily from a human perspective. So we spend a lot of time from a people perspective validating what is or is not happening with customers, carriers, with our own drivers in the work that we're doing. In our future, we're working towards more machine learning and AI that we'll do more prediction and be able to solve for that more in real time.So what John talked about that would take us weeks, has moved to only a couple of weeks to days at this point, that still has too much human interaction in that process. And the machine can learn over a period of time with the right level of data. And so for perspective inside 360, we set new records in both February and March and the key statistics that we watch and then we've taken another step change here in April.So, of the 40 plus stats that we watch, 75% of those broke new records here in the last week to two weeks. And those continue to move forward. So the level of data is growing by almost triple digits and anytime that you can do that and actually use the machine to do it's very difficult at a human level to consume it, but at the machine level, I think solving for that over the next one to three years will change the way we can do business and be able to offer better answers for our customers.\nNick Hobbs: And I would just say on the Dedicated side that our base of business is so much more solid today than it was back in 2008, 2009, and we don't have as much quasi dedicated in there, it's more solid private fleets and so I think we're rock solid base to be able to weather the storm even better than we did in 2008 and 2009.\nTom Wadewitz: That's all very helpful. I just had a brief follow-up and Shelley with respect to Intermodal contract pricing. I mean, you have more data, you're better at responding yourself, but you still don't control the market. So do you think I mean is it realistic to expect that truckload contracts and Intermodal contract pricing will be meaningfully down if rate stays weak for a while, or you think there's a chance we don't see that on the Intermodal side?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, so I would just say in general across all the businesses, it is a longer-term play from a bid perspective. So any customer that's in the spot market, they're going to get the benefit or the other side of what's happening from a price perspective. And so there are some customers that are in the spot market. And as customers we want to help get through this spot market. So if they want to take advantage of what's happening in the market today, we talked to them about being fluid in their pricing approach and we're very open minded to that across our business in total, but I would say, I don't think that being down meaningfully would play into this bid season, we're too far into the bid season. Our cost structure, everything is longer-term, be very difficult for us to offer significant discounts off of our base costs that we have today.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, thank you for the time.\nOperator: And we will take one final question. The final question comes from the line of Ben Hartford with Baird.\nBen Hartford: Thanks for fitting me in. Shelley, just a final point on the supply situation what you're seeing within the brokerage market, the comment that you had made about changing the payment terms in March, I think is interesting. And then the approach that you guys are taking from a cash management standpoint, but I guess first thing with regard to the change in payment terms in 360. Do you anticipate that being a permanent change and if so, I guess in the context of the cash collection cycles being constrained throughout 2Q and 3Q presumably across the industry, do you see this as an opportunity to kind of accelerate the build-out of scale attracting supply into the 360 platform? And to what extent does that change payment terms play into that?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, so we did offer those carriers payment terms changes for the month of April, but we're also walking them through how they can get paid all for free within two days. And so, that payment is made available to them over the long-term. And so if a carrier is interacting in 360 and they perform their work inside the platform, they upload their bills, give us their -- the documentation and they're paid back to their checking account in two days all for free. This is significant change for them over a factoring company, that they may be paying a much higher percentage two in total. We do think that's an important component to building scale in the platform. So we are very close to the carrier community and walking them through how they can take advantage of that.\nBen Hartford: And then, just to be clear, as you see the balance of the year now within ICS on the gross margin and on the EBIT line, the level of compression in the first quarter from a gross margin perspective and the operating losses, are these representative run rates in your mind as you kind of play out the year. I know it's very unclear the year, but just trying to get a sense for, was it unique this quarter, and it'll kind of normalize back up a little bit and still run operating losses, or is this kind of a new run rate for the balance of the year?\nShelley Simpson: Well, certainly I think it's too early to call the entire year. I think I could talk about the next couple of weeks and have a lot of confidence. And then as we get past that, I get less and less confidence. Again, we're spending a lot of time taking care of our people and focusing on meeting the promises of our customer says there are two objectives. I do think here in April, maybe over the next couple of weeks, margins have improved as shipments have declined in total and we've come-off of those higher margins going or higher PTE numbers. In total, I did talk about being 35% over plan, I would expect to be under plan in Q2, in total from this scaling part of our business, but it'd be way too early for me to call what I think will happen for the year, I would say we're committed to our long-term plan of building the most efficient transportation network and to do that, we have to be scaled. And so that is going to be our focus over the short and long-term.\nBen Hartford: Understood, thanks.\nBrad Delco: Hey, Ben, this is Brad. Just to kind of reiterate the comments I made on my opening remarks, as you should expect gross margins will fluctuate based on the relationship between supply and demand and the markets we serve. Clearly that relationship was quite challenged in Q1. So we have seen the market loosen up. So hopefully that would imply we've seen a little bit of relief on net revenue margins at least thus far in April.\nBen Hartford: Understood, appreciate the time.\nOperator: With that, we have reached our allotted time for questions. I'll hand it back to the speakers for closing remarks.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. This is John Roberts. I'll just close this by saying that on March 13 we called a meeting with our executive team without much time and said on Monday that was a Friday, Monday we would be working remotely in response to a coming Pandemic and unknown challenges. We have responded to that in a way that I really didn't fully appreciate or expect and I just would like many CEOs I've seen on CNBC, I'm incredibly proud of the people in this company for the way they're handling this unknown, and I've talked to some folks downstairs earlier today about these cultures don't lie, and I think in all the conversations we're having about rates and loads and volume and equipment, CapEx that's vitally important, no doubt, but underneath all of that is a team of 30,000 people that are picking up and delivering freight every single day, taking care of customers, making sure we keep this place healthy and solid, and that is I think something we should not overlook. We appreciate your time today. We look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John. As John mentioned, the team is going to cover specific on the segment results. So, I'd like to provide some comments on our approach to addressing the pandemic during the quarter and more importantly, going forward. We obviously entered the first quarter of 2020 with a very different expectation and what ultimately transpired. While the pandemic offers a level of uncertainty not seen in many years, J.B. Hunt is essential to the recovery, and our focus remains consistent, which is to sell for our customer's needs.We are confident in our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. Our target leverage ratio is one times EBITDA, which is where we landed at March 31. We're not afraid to go above this target in the near-term if conditions warrant, and we have the credit resources to do so. We ended the quarter with approximately $48 million in cash, and we currently have zero drawn on the revolver, which has $750 million of borrowing capacity, and an option to take that up to $1 billion. We remain confident in our ability to access cash, given the strength of our banker, and we maintain close communication with that group. In addition, we intend and expect to emerge from the current economic environment with our investment grade rating intact.With respect to cash flow generation, outside the risk of declines in the freight market, we view our largest risk going into the second quarter around our customer's liquidity and ability to pay. We monitor working capital on a daily basis and are in frequent communication with our customers and providers. We're beginning to see an increase in certain customers reaching out to discuss liquidity concerns, and while we understand their liquidity issues, we have to enforce our terms that we have agreed to. Our carriers and suppliers expect us to pay according to returns, and we must expect the same from our customers.From a capital deployment standpoint, our approach remains the same. We invest in our people and business growth, we will maintain our working capital and leverage positions, return value to shareholders through dividends, and we'll continue an opportunistic approach to share repurchases. This has been our focus and will remain so for the long-term. Although, we certainly recognize the current environment, but believe our framework allows us to make discretionary adjustments to this approach as needed.In the near-term, we are reprioritizing some of our 2020 spend to essential and critical items. We're evaluating expenditures based on those that must happen, those that can be deferred, and those that are capable of being cancelled, but we have example with plans to expand a terminal facility in our Southwest region during the second quarter to accommodate long-term growth beyond our 2020 needs. However, in light of the current state, we have paused this project until we are in a more predictable environment. Further, our opportunistic buyback approach allows for discretion based on liquidity needs at the time. So, while we have historically planned for excess cash to be used for buybacks, we may have to hold the cash at the interim.Additionally, while we continue to evaluate the market for M&A opportunities, any potential transaction will still follow our normal evaluation process, which considers liquidity and funding requirements. Today, cost reduction actions have consisted mostly of canceling non-essential travel, pausing hiring activities, and delaying other discretionary spend, which we will continue to do so as needed. It's difficult to determine the specific impact the pandemic has had on our revenues and costs. However, we have identified approximately $15 million of specific costs in the first quarter that were not planned going into the quarter. The largest of which was our special bonus for approximately $12 million, as we noted in our release.Considering our cost structure, a large portion of our costs are varied. Our purchase transportation expense, which represents nearly 55% of our cost, is heavily tied to loads. Our next largest cost item is salaries and wages, which includes driver pay. Well, driver pay is mostly a variable cost, you can expect to see less variability in the near-term due to increases in paid time-offs for quarantined employees and offsets to reduce pay due to slowdowns. Today, we have not made adjustments to our costs that are considered more fixed in nature. However, we are carefully monitoring the environment, and are prepared to adjust if necessary.Lastly, with respect to CapEx, we've paused or canceled certain CapEx that was originally planned for 2020 that we view as non-essential in the near-term. This includes delaying or canceling orders for tractors, containers, and trailing equipment, where appropriate. However, keep in mind that not all of this is under our control as we're at the mercy of our suppliers. To the extent manufacturers have production slowdowns as a result of the pandemic we may need to adjust our CapEx accordingly. We previously provided our 2020 CapEx forecast to be between $675 million to $700 million. Our current view for CapEx due to the factors noted is now in the range of $575 million to $600 million. This is roughly $425 million to $450 million of maintenance, and the remainder is growth or success-based CapEx.And Brad, that covers my prepared remarks. Well, Justin, I mean you used the term, \"Balance,\" and that's exactly how we think about it. I don't believe we have any one specific game plan out there that says based on the downturn of the demand for shipping we need to go take share. That's not necessarily our approach. Would we be opportunistic with customer opportunities when that business is something that would be beneficial to our network? Absolutely, but I would think we would have been equally opportunistic with that opportunity had we not been in any kind of a downturn. So I don't want to -- I would not suggest that we have changed our philosophy. Certainly we are communicating with our rail providers regularly, and when the opportunity exists, if it ever did, and we could look at reduce our cost in some manner that allowed us to offer a little bit more aggressive pricing where it wasn't about a margin sacrifice then we would certainly look to do that. And those -- again, all of that happens one customer, one proposal at a time. And I just want to emphasize too that the conversation that we're having with customers is very objective and crisp around how we, as John said, how we are set up pay our vendors. So when we get in to talking through extending terms, it's really not conducive in this line of work as it might be in others, but for us it's not really something we're supporting right now, and now getting good response. So, well, actually, we received the award at the end of 2019. I think we announced that on October 30. As we implemented that award and went through the first month or two of this year, we understood that we needed to true up the payment for how much we paid BNSF in 2019, and that's what that announcement was about. It was actually related to the entire calendar year for 2019. Yes. So, Ken, this is John Kuhlow. Just to kind of clarify most of the -- we have the ability to cancel, but today, it's mostly timing or delaying those orders. So, until we kind of have a better sense of what our needs are, but to give you a little bit more deeper perspective on CapEx, we're probably at about $400 million or maintenance and by segment that's roughly $50 million for truck around 130 or Intermodal and 150 per DCS. Now, keep in mind that also includes what we include in the maintenance is our investments in the back office technology for the company, and that's still around $80 million to $90 million for the year. So that's how we get to the $4 million and then the rest is primarily Intermodal and Dedicated for any success base growth that we might have in those segments. So, okay, let me give some answers on that we have that basically broken down into three channels. The first channel is furniture, and that is probably 95% asset light. So when they shut down, we may still have some buildings and then some of those we build the customer for those buildings still ongoing. So it is multiple things there you look at, but then for the equipment, it's all contractors, so our contractors, we try to get them connected for paycheck protection to afford them and the direction of a bank to help them through this time, so that costs will go away.Then the second channel is retail replenishment. That's basically our off price retail, and they are basically all shut down right now they're non-essential, and so that's where we have some company drivers. And so, on that channel we have tried to outsource as much as we can, but we also have some different types of equipment in there that can't go do Intermodal or Dedicated work. So there's about 300 of them. And so, we've chosen to pay them so that when the retailer's come back online, we will be ready to go, and we expect when those off price retailers come back, the volume will be pretty good.And then on the appliance side, which is the third channel, those are up, those are essential. And so, we're still doing deliveries for them. In some areas there is just to the doorstep not inside, but in other areas it is still inside. That volume in general is down 10% or 15%, but it is still up and going. And that is 50-50 of company employees and non-asset on the appliance side. And so we were agnostic, and we'll pass both of them to a customer and let them pick and choose on how they do that. Okay. Great. I would just tell you that typically in Q2, we see a big spring surge for home improvement. And so that takes our volume up and our revenue up at some of those accounts. We haven't really seen that. We've seen a little bit, but not a lot, but what for I've kind of seen and what I've looked at is, we had a pretty good Q1, and our volume is still across the board very consistent and dedicated compared to Q1 of this year, and it's maintaining. Yes, it's been shifted around different customers, but we're not seeing that fall off any. So at this point, we feel good about our volume being about the same as what it was in Q1, but you would typically see our volume surge up some. Margins, I will still tell you that the margins 11 to 13 ought to be pretty good goalposts for us to hit, but again, there is a lot of moving parts, but I think we feel very comfortable with what we're saying at this point in Q2."

            "content": "Yes, and so far as our mix of business, I think you clearly see, particularly once this pandemic hit us, our flexibility to move assets around from some of our customers that were more impacted than other, essential versus nonessential, some of our retail apparel, those segments were down 11% or so, but food was up 16%, home improvement 21%, office furniture was just falling off basically, and some automotive suppliers was down as well. Our Ag was very consistent. So, we've got a very diverse portfolio. And you're going to continue to see that as we move forward. And so we were able to move some of those segments around for the -- they may have been shut down or they may be slow, we were able to move over -- on an average we've moved about a thousand trucks a day from their base accounts over to others.So, within Dedicated, we've repositioned any assets that where the customers have been slow over to where our customers are very, very busy. And again, that's something when you operate as a private fleet you struggle with, you don't have another outsource. But that's the advantage that we bring to a lot of private fleets. They have the same control and service with us and great visibility with the flexibility to move some assets. Yes, I would say we would see more -- we see the same. When I get over into Final Mile we're a little on the furniture side. Those are more dramatically impacted so the volume on the furniture folks is up a little bit more. Yes. Well, first of all, in Dedicated, all of our trucks are working. So, we've got them all moved around. They're supporting Intermodal in some places, but in other accounts, it's the other account that is surging up, they're looking for equipment, and so, we bring in other Dedicated. So, example, our grocery businesses, we serve probably nine or 10 different grocers. Our business is very, very robust, and so, basically can't handle it, and if they're up 16%-20%, we'll bring those trucks in from other accounts, and so, the account that is busy is the one that pays for them, and then we give a credit back to the other account, where if they had a private fleet, they'd be paying that driver pay and the cost of that equipment, and so, that's all set. So that's how that works. Yes. And I would just say on the Dedicated side that our base of business is so much more solid today than it was back in 2008, 2009, and we don't have as much quasi dedicated in there, it's more solid private fleets and so I think we're rock solid base to be able to weather the storm even better than we did in 2008 and 2009."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Yes, so just as a reminder for us. Our investment was really in three areas that Brad alluded to. We have focused on our people side, which I think we have done a good job watching our people costs as we came through March, and are even watching that coming in to April. We also invested in the technology spend, and those projects are not one or two-month projects; those are projects that are planned out over a longer period of time. And those projects we believe are critical in helping us create a more efficient transportation network. That is our focus. We will continue that plan from a technology spend and have confidence based on some of the data that we're seeing from both customers and carriers.Finally on the scaling part of the process, that was really an acceleration of our shipments and revenue plan with our customers and with carriers. And as those are onboarding our ability to know exactly which customer or carrier should be connected at which time was really the risk that would happen and the association to that. For us, coming though COVID-19, we really -- if you think about what we invested in total, we invested about 77% in our scaling of the business. That was about 35% over planned. I talked about on the first quarter earnings release that January was constrained on the supply side and unusual activity the first two weeks, and that created pressure from a margin perspective -- unexpected in January. February did come to more normal, and then certainly March had the most pressure on it from a margin perspective in total. So from our plan, we did a nice job from a people perspective being better than plan in total, offset by worse margin and a slight miss to our revenue plan in total. So we have evaluated what part of our customers move essential and nonessential goods in total and by segment. And our concern around the customer base in total, we have had communication with some customers that are having good conversation and calling us. Our bigger concern are customers that we're not hearing from, and so that has been, over the last several weeks, a main objective of our sales organization to really lean in and work closely with customers. We are having regular conversation daily with our customers just to make sure that we're staying on top of that. I do think it's a risk, but I do think that we're talking to customers on a regular cadence, and so far I don't see any surprise there. Yes, I would just add, I think our customers understand the necessity of us keeping our drivers and maintenance employees there on the frontline ready for our customers. That has been viewed favorably from them. As well as we did change our payment terms for the carry community from a truckload space. So anyone that moved a shipment in Carrier 360 in the month of March, we have moved up their payment days to only pay in seven days. So we're trying to get them cash more quickly. We've explained all of that to our customers. They've been very receptive so far. We're just trying to be offensive, be in front of it, and make sure that they understand what we're doing to help. Okay, I think that it is time that we have had a -- what I would call a crisis in the market. We tend to accelerate our relationship with our customers. And I would tell you, I feel like during this crisis, we are doing that very thing. I think John Kuhlow mentioned this in his opening remarks, but we're really focused on two key objectives here in the second quarter. The first one is taking care of our people, and making sure that that's first and foremost, that we're taking care of our people and each other. And the second one is meeting our customer's promises. And as a result of that, I will tell you, Todd, every customer needs something a little bit different. The customers that Nick talked about that are very robust right now in the grocery side. Those customers are really utilizing all of our services across the company, and we're bringing as much capacity as needed to help them I would say in nearly every segment, every service that we do business with other customers that are shut down, we're having a different conversation with them.To add on to what Darren said about bid season, I also think that probably 80% to 90% of our customers have stayed on the path of what they're doing from a bid perspective. The other ones are just in a wait and see environment. I think our mix of business is fairly healthy and thankfully for us, the customers that are doing well, we tend to do a lot of business with those customers as well. And I think that has helped us coming into this. I think our customers are open minded if we went back to any point in time that we had a downturn or pressure from a profit or revenue perspective at a customer level. They're very open-minded to doing business the most efficient way that we can do business together. So I would say every customer is pretty open-minded as to what we need to do and how we need to grow.Then lastly, I have seen our customers lean more into us wanting to do more business. If you look at just graphics maybe from a highway perspective, but this should pretty much be across the board, how we get the most business I would say small-to-mid sized customers. You see our largest customers, mid-to-large customers really doing much better during this kind of crisis than you see are small, even some medium and micro shippers. There's the customers that are either shut down or trying to work through the crisis and having a little more difficult time in total, and that too we're being more flexible with, they tend to be in our highway services. So for them, the price will be fluid, and if the market is going down, we'll be able to help them save money. And Brian, I would say I haven't seen any dramatic change from a competitive landscape. I think that's how we started the year. It is similar to that as we stand today. I do think that because the fragmentation of brokers, there are some brokerage companies that aren't doing as well, and so they are a lot more aggressive particularly in the spot environment. I have seen our customers really stay to the providers that they have selected already, whether it's asset or non-asset, so I haven't seen a huge fall off from published business or awarded business moving to someone else. I think from a consolidation perspective, I think it's been difficult from our brokerage perspective to weather the storm. If you think about the cyclicality of brokerage, we really started seeing the shift happened in 2019 as the market was correcting from a brokerage perspective, brokers are really changing the price while PTE was rising in total and that some of what I commented in December and January, the supply side starting to tighten, I think that part of the business will continue to have some push as we've moved into second quarter and PTE has had pressure on it downward because shipments aren't as plentiful. It comes down to how much can the price really change before that impacts the supply side of the equation, and then I think there could be consolidation as a result from both brokerage and from the carrier perspective.From a 360 perspective, we have gained more confidence through this crisis that our platform is actually helping us perform more agile and be very open and transparent about the data with our customers. What we have found is our customers are leaning in more to us from a total shipper perspective, I believe on the earnings release, we reported that our shipment count grew 44% in the platform, and that's a direct result of what we're doing in the truckload space. Our customers have also leaned into us from a 360 box perspective as they have started learning what we can do from a platform, really putting together the right truck on the right load at the right, they start to see that change their business in total, and that's how we started and why we started our 360 Box business. Our customers in Q1 leaned into that part of our model and we actually had a slight increase in revenue from our plan in Q1, we feel comfortable with that plan and the complementary nature between the drop and hook part of the business over the market, which is about half of the Tier market with the live load business, which is the other half of the market. We think that's part of the inefficiency that exists and when you put those two networks together, that we can create a more efficient network. Our customers are leaning into that and we feel comfortable about our growth plans in 360. You're welcome. I would say, I think that the level of data that we have that John talked about has grown exponentially. And today we use that data primarily from a human perspective. So we spend a lot of time from a people perspective validating what is or is not happening with customers, carriers, with our own drivers in the work that we're doing. In our future, we're working towards more machine learning and AI that we'll do more prediction and be able to solve for that more in real time.So what John talked about that would take us weeks, has moved to only a couple of weeks to days at this point, that still has too much human interaction in that process. And the machine can learn over a period of time with the right level of data. And so for perspective inside 360, we set new records in both February and March and the key statistics that we watch and then we've taken another step change here in April.So, of the 40 plus stats that we watch, 75% of those broke new records here in the last week to two weeks. And those continue to move forward. So the level of data is growing by almost triple digits and anytime that you can do that and actually use the machine to do it's very difficult at a human level to consume it, but at the machine level, I think solving for that over the next one to three years will change the way we can do business and be able to offer better answers for our customers. Yes, so I would just say in general across all the businesses, it is a longer-term play from a bid perspective. So any customer that's in the spot market, they're going to get the benefit or the other side of what's happening from a price perspective. And so there are some customers that are in the spot market. And as customers we want to help get through this spot market. So if they want to take advantage of what's happening in the market today, we talked to them about being fluid in their pricing approach and we're very open minded to that across our business in total, but I would say, I don't think that being down meaningfully would play into this bid season, we're too far into the bid season. Our cost structure, everything is longer-term, be very difficult for us to offer significant discounts off of our base costs that we have today. Yes, so we did offer those carriers payment terms changes for the month of April, but we're also walking them through how they can get paid all for free within two days. And so, that payment is made available to them over the long-term. And so if a carrier is interacting in 360 and they perform their work inside the platform, they upload their bills, give us their -- the documentation and they're paid back to their checking account in two days all for free. This is significant change for them over a factoring company, that they may be paying a much higher percentage two in total. We do think that's an important component to building scale in the platform. So we are very close to the carrier community and walking them through how they can take advantage of that. Well, certainly I think it's too early to call the entire year. I think I could talk about the next couple of weeks and have a lot of confidence. And then as we get past that, I get less and less confidence. Again, we're spending a lot of time taking care of our people and focusing on meeting the promises of our customer says there are two objectives. I do think here in April, maybe over the next couple of weeks, margins have improved as shipments have declined in total and we've come-off of those higher margins going or higher PTE numbers. In total, I did talk about being 35% over plan, I would expect to be under plan in Q2, in total from this scaling part of our business, but it'd be way too early for me to call what I think will happen for the year, I would say we're committed to our long-term plan of building the most efficient transportation network and to do that, we have to be scaled. And so that is going to be our focus over the short and long-term."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Okay. This is Darren. So, we obviously knew this question would be early on. So, when we came out of March, there was an impact to import volumes on the West Coast as a result of the slowdown of exports from China or the China side of a slowdown based on what was going on in China. As we've come out of March and we're in to April, we're experiencing meaningful declines in volume probably to tune of mid to high single digits. As we get into what we're learning about the future, we don't have visibility into what probably the back half of May and June represent, but certainly for the next three to four weeks I would expect that trend to continue. And just my opinion and my opinion alone, I mean I would expect that the volumes in Intermodal to be in the double-digit negative for the quarter. So, okay, I'll answer the bid season question. Certainly bid season is ongoing. We have had -- we, really prior to a lot of people from the world going to work from home, we had completed pricing on about a third of our business, maybe a little bit more than that, and that the results of that first [indiscernible] were probably about what we had expected them to be before any of this challenge to the economy had taken place. While we for the last four weeks, we have a handful of customers that are -- have exercised a bid, they've received results, but they're not in a good spot to implement that bid and they've delayed the start of it. Some of those have communicated maybe a delay. An example would just be a May 1st to a June 1st delay in new pricing. Some of the customers have effectively said, \"We will delay indefinitely until we can give you a different answer.\"We have a handful of customers that are asking us to go faster, and in those cases the reason they're going faster is they're actually -- they're shipping demands may actually be increasing for the second quarter, and they're looking to secure capacity and know that they've got the ability to do that. So for the most part, I would say that we have the -- the bid season has been what I would have expected it to. Now, every year we may price a project work for a host of different customers that are heavily involved in spring activities, and some of those kinds of projects may just not occur this year in Q2. So there's shipment volumes historically that are probably -- frankly they're just not going to ship, they're not going to happen. It's now to push off the business into the third quarter or just the activity that won't exist. And so, there's a little bit of a slowdown in that world, but that's not a huge percentage of what we do. In terms of sharing margin impact from a lack of -- from weaker volumes, certainly what we've talked about in the past is the price affects our margin more significantly that just the fixed cost or a lack of utilization of our assets. And that still remains true. However, having idle containers looking for work to do is impactful. The network fluidity or the balance of our system is significantly different than what we have believed is normal over the last 20 years.So the West Coast volumes that we move to the East are some of the longer length of haul and some of the higher rated business. So that volume has slowed more than other, and at the same time we have business from the Midwest, from the interior of the country for consumer products to support the population base on the West Coast that has surged up a little bit. So, you've got an increase in volume at in backhaul lanes and a loss of volume in headhaul lanes, and that that's impactful. So, I'm not going to answer your question specifically about a direct impact to the margin, but we have challenges there certainly as anyone would with the decline of volume. The Intermodal service we're experiencing in our network today, their capacity available and on time performance of the trains, is the best in my 25 year career. And I think that's probably because of their decline in volumes in certainly they implemented operating plans, many of them over the last three to four years that are working out and having some success, but yes, it is my belief that right now rail is the best we have ever experienced."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Brad. Continuing with our format of opening remarks, let me start by thanking the J.B. Hunt teams around the country for the tireless commitment and hard work that has occurred and will continue in response to the conditions we've faced during this pandemic, and in particular, I want to recognize the efforts and sacrifice of our driving forces and our maintenance teams. We have had virtually full staff show rates every day. As you all know, drivers and maintenance teams cannot work remotely. Lastly, I wish to recognize the work of all office personnel in making a swift and effective adjustment to remote-style work to support our drivers and customers. On behalf of the leadership team, we greatly appreciate you all.Obviously our commentary on this quarter and the balance of this year will be disrupted by the impact of the COVID-19 situation in many ways. Please be advised that senior management across the company meets via conference twice daily on all macro issues relating to staffing, human resources' safety, and customer dynamics to stay very current and agile. We clearly cannot predict the timing or depth of the coming cycles, but by covering this data frequently we do get a sense for direction and potential magnitude of change. Our views on the current situation include focus on capital deployment, margin recovery, cost saving levers, prior recession performance, recent weekly-monthly performance trends, cash flow generation, CapEx projections, balance sheet strengthening and liquidity preservation, portfolio exposure, and recovery trends. We will touch on these topics and others as we review our work with you today and in the coming calls we will have.In all, we see the environment showing near-term disruption and turbulence, but expect the longer-term to present opportunities to capitalize on many of our existing priorities, including our efforts with 360, our Final Mile and private fleet outsourcing businesses in both our Highway Services and Intermodal. We're evaluating several categories of internal and external data to better understand the slope and timing of the import activities that will impact our Intermodal networks, which Darren will comment on during discussion. We're also studying market information to help us estimate how the domestic freight trends will move in the coming weeks and months.As mentioned, we are working remotely where possible, which include above 90% at our corporate campuses, and approaching 50% in our field locations. We are pleased to report that recent investments in strengthening all aspects of our technology infrastructure and resiliency have delivered the results needed. Our ability to stay connected with each other, our customers, and our drivers has kept us fully operational.In addition to our traditional workflows, the positioning of our digital freight management platforms, known as 360, is enabling a different type of response to fast-changing needs by our people, customers, and carriers. A recent expansion to the baseline connectivity we had been reporting on, we are currently testing a comprehensive electronic bill of lading program to capture needed proof of delivery and signatures in a no-touch environment. This option will be available to all carriers and customers in early May. Shelley will cover some of the details for us here. This is a good example of our continuing development in 360.The comprehensive nature of our transportation offerings create many benefits to our customers. In addition to those long-held advantages, we are seeing that our broad reach of services presents us with options to reallocate our assets and people. As noted, we are seeing declines in some channels with surges in others.There are several options available to us in the way we handle the demands from our customers in Intermodal, DCS, Truckload, and ICS. During our discussion today, we will call out some examples of how we are providing resources within and across -- I'm sorry, pivoting resources within and across segments.A new element of our presentation includes the breakout of Final Mile Services. Lastly, we provided some historical data to help get you acclimated to the trends in this offering. Of all our business lines, this one has been hit the hardest in our ability to relocate assets, drivers, and contractors due to the nature of the equipment and services provided. Nick will be able to provide more information on our near-term expectations for Final Mile. While the environment we are in will make it difficult to effectively model this business in the near-term, we are hopeful that at least you can get more familiar with our recent trends. Even in the current turbulence, we have seen nothing that changes our strategic direction in any area of the company. In fact, we are encouraged by our positioning, and while we plan to be thoughtful about discretionary cost controls in the near-term, our long-term plans and expectations have not changed meaningfully.At this time, I'll ask John Kuhlow to make some comments on our current financial state, and then Brad will close up our planned remarks, opening for questions following that. John? Yes, I will do that. I will just tell you that we were off to a really good start. In Q1, we signed contracts on 350 plus trucks. So, that's a very good quarter for us. We signed our last deal just a couple of weeks ago. With that being said, as we kind of look ahead, it's hard to get meetings, we're trying to do some teams meetings, Microsoft, Zoom you name it, but those are slowing down, customers have other priorities right now. So, we're seeing our verbal slow down just a little bit, and we expect that to continue just a little bit. If you look back at the recession in '08-'09, our sales went down by about 20%. So, I think it's probably pretty good to assume that that's pretty close to what will happen here. So, I think we gave a guidance of 800 to 1,000. So, it could be 600 to 800 on sales, but also during the recession, the way our model works is our customers long-term, they need to take a truck or two out, we see a lot of pressure on our fleets to downsize a little bit, and so, we'll take some of those out. We look at it for the long-term with the customer, and we'll take some of those out. So with that, our net adds may not be as robust this year as they have been in the past two or three years, but the demand is still out there for private fleets, and we still got a full pipeline, but we just think there's going to be a little pause till we come out of this, and then we'll pick back up again. Yes, we spent some time going back and thinking about how we got into that recession, what the drivers were and then the results coming out of it. Nick and I had a good conversation today about what channels were open during that time that kind of closed down on us and how we sort of remodeled the portfolio, and that's really the time in DCS where we pointed our efforts more towards private fleets away from capacity management that doesn't completely take us out of the churn in the downturn and then the outcoming results from the recovery, but we think that we got a better view there and we will no doubt see some impact going in, but our approach on that side of the business is to serve the customer in every way that we can knowing that it's a long game and so we really stay away from and have benefited from not getting into short-term and our thinking or our approach really with any of our segments. On our trucking and highway business, I'm so much more encouraged and confident in that business because of all the work that's been done in everything from the geographies that we serve, the length of halls that we're in, the way we've set the equipment up, there's a lot more versatility there.So as far as going in to a downturn and then how we come back out, I think we'll be more nimble and more quick to be able to respond. When you own every truck and every trailer, there's only so much you can do and that can really put pressure on pricing and margins and performance that takes a long time to recover from, I think we'll see that differently coming out. On Intermodal, it's a good answer, going into a recovery, depending on pricing or has historically been, I think that fuels a big deal in Intermodal that can be a real plus or maybe not, not an event, and I think with low fuel prices and I expected they'll stay low for a while. So, we'll probably see that be a little different from the past. In total though, I really feel like we're in as good a position as we've ever been, our pricing approach is so much more rich and robust than it's ever been in the past. Our timing of response is so much better than it's ever been. I mean, we are coming from months to weeks now where we can see changes in the markets that we serve and are able to respond so much more quickly, and I predict that will even get better. I think the more data we get into our system the better we're going to be able to respond as we start to come out of what would be considered I guess a downturn. That's what we're expecting anyway. I don't know if you guys want to add anything to that? Thank you. This is John Roberts. I'll just close this by saying that on March 13 we called a meeting with our executive team without much time and said on Monday that was a Friday, Monday we would be working remotely in response to a coming Pandemic and unknown challenges. We have responded to that in a way that I really didn't fully appreciate or expect and I just would like many CEOs I've seen on CNBC, I'm incredibly proud of the people in this company for the way they're handling this unknown, and I've talked to some folks downstairs earlier today about these cultures don't lie, and I think in all the conversations we're having about rates and loads and volume and equipment, CapEx that's vitally important, no doubt, but underneath all of that is a team of 30,000 people that are picking up and delivering freight every single day, taking care of customers, making sure we keep this place healthy and solid, and that is I think something we should not overlook. We appreciate your time today. We look forward to talking to you in the coming weeks."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advise that today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations, Mr. Brad Delco. Please go ahead.\nBrad Delco: Good morning. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

For more information regarding the risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I would like to introduce speakers on today\u2019s call. This afternoon, I am joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of Human and -- People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks Brad. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We all thought 2020 was a remarkable year in our history, but I\u2019ll consider 2021 as a good contender for being equally challenging. And in the midst of perpetual challenge, we have continued to see our collective resiliency and strength periods during these unique times. Our teams have adjusted and adapted to multiple scenario changes impacting our customer\u2019s ability to thrive. In 2021, our leaders made bold calls to increase investments in our people, our technologies and expanding our fleets across our asset base. We have long been committed to following a disciplined approach for all capital allocations and believe these investments are good for our customers in the long-term. I can\u2019t say enough about the way every one of our team members has risen to the opportunities presented in this current environment. Accordingly, we have done exhausted research on where we stand regarding being competitive in total compensation for our people as we move into 2022. Our team leaders have unilaterally approved comprehensive changes to our base wages, incentive compensation, and benefits. Increasing our awareness for how we approach attracting and retaining the best talent is critical to our mission of creating the most efficient transportation network in North America. The overall growth we experienced in 2021 is unprecedented. Once again, revealing the necessity of our services and confirming the approach our people take on solving our customer\u2019s challenges. We added 1,778 tractors to DCS, 6,284 containers in the Intermodal with 531 net tractor adds and 3,605 trailers for our 360box program in highway. We continue to work strategically with our equipment providers on build and delivery plans as we head into 2022. With the growth coming out of 2021, we anticipate ongoing demand for all types of power and trailer equipment. We also look forward to working with our rail service providers to find improvements across all aspects of intermodal service, capacity management and utilization. Lastly, I\u2019ll comment on our efforts relating to sustainability. Over the past several years, we have worked to better understand, communicate and advance our positioning in this important area. While we have seen good progress and have been recognized by many third parties for our efforts, we also believe we have important work to do. We are committed to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America and we are also committed to being transparent on the progress of our sustainability journey. This concludes my remarks. Our executives will provide more specific information, so I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow.\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will follow a similar pattern as our previous calls, where I\u2019ll review our recent performance on a consolidated level. I\u2019ll then provide some commentary on our CapEx plans for 2022, and as well as our approach to capital allocation and then I\u2019ll close with some thoughts on our financial priorities for the coming year. Overall, we were pleased with our fourth quarter performance, highlighted by growing revenues 28% and operating income 55% over the prior year period. We saw positive year-over-year revenue performance across all segments and positive operating income performance in all segments, except for DCS, which Nick will cover in greater detail in his remarks. As I look across our business, the common denominator in terms of our pain points continues to be labor related and wages, salaries, benefits, and recruiting trends, in both driver and non-driver. We continue to elevate investments in our people, as was evidenced by our decision to provide a special bonus in December of nearly $11 million to our frontline workers for their efforts in working through the supply chain challenges facing our customers and the industry. Below the line interest expense was slightly lower and the tax rate slightly higher than the prior period, resulting in GAAP EPS of $2.28 a share. For the quarter were 58% increase versus the prior year period. As has been stated in previous calls, the impacts of network congestion, labor shortages and general supply chain challenges are well known and have continued to have a meaningful impact on our business and are likely to persist, particularly given the heightened challenges evolving around COVID infections across our country. We ended the quarter with $356 million of cash, which was slightly higher than plan. Last quarter, I provided you with updated thoughts on our 2021 net CapEx and that would fall within the $1 billion range, which we missed by approximately $130 million. This miss was almost entirely due to supply chain delays contained to impact our ability to take timely delivery of our equipment. We remain committed to these investments and capacity to help serve our customers, and we anticipate net CapEx for 2022 to approximately $1.5 billion. We continue to prioritize our capital to invest in our business, support our dividend, repurchase, shares and opportunistically execute on our M&A strategy, all while maintaining a modest net leverage ratio of around 1 times EBITDA, and importantly, continuing to maintain our investment grade status. Before I close out my comments and in light of expecting some questions around our 2022 outlook, I\u2019d like to provide you some context, not guidance, but contacts for our financial priorities in 2022. These priorities include, continuing investments in our people, maintaining a strong balance sheet to support all of our plans investments and focusing on generating appropriate returns on the capital we are investing to grow our businesses and serve our customers. This discipline focus on the priorities enables us to manage the business for long-term growth and success. That concludes my remarks. I\u2019ll turn it over to Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. Today I want my commercial update to focus first on a quick review of 2021 and how we were able to deliver for our customers. I will then focus my comments on the market and how we are going to approach the ongoing supply chain challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Finally, I\u2019ll finish up with some updates on our priorities for J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform as we move forward. As we have discussed over the past year, the freight environment has been extremely volatile and unpredictable, and not just for capacity providers, but also for those that we are providing capacity for to meet their needs. And this environment we as an organization like our customers have had to adapt to this disruption and I firmly believe that our moat agnostic comprehensive supply chain solutions approach has been a key to help our customers over the last year, where we were able to honor our commitments in particularly during peak season. Another key element of our success was a significant commitment and investment in physical assets across all of our business segments, from containers and chassis to trucks and trailers. That said, I would be remiss to leave out the most critical element of our success and that is our people, our drivers, mechanics, load planners and all of those behind the scenes, helping our frontline workers succeed. Tying it all together, of course, was our technology platform J.B. Hunt 360, which I believe gives us a distinct advantage and sourcing efficient capacity for our customers. Simply put, our investments, people and technology put us in a position to say yes in 2021 and has me excited for our future growth as more and more customers are leaning in. As we look at the market today and tried to prepare for the year ahead, many components of our business plan and go-to-market strategy are similar to those exercise here in our recent past. The market remains challenging, capacity constrained and unpredictable, and we will need to remain agile in our approach to securing capacity for our customers. Some unique areas as the impacting capacity is the ability to source new equipment, which is likely to keep used truck prices elevated, and as a result, small carrier rates as well. I see customers wanting to lock up more capacity in Dedicated arrangements and lean into technologies that drive efficiency in their supply chain and how they procure capacity. As an organization, we see tremendous pent-up demand to convert highway freight to intermodal with elevated truck rates, the tight labor market, higher fuel prices and a 60% improvement in carbon efficiency intermodal offers versus truck. Needless to say, 2022 will present us with many opportunities to grow and we will approach the market similar to how we always have, serving our customers as our top priority, while maintaining sound financial discipline. Finally, as I look at the investments we have made building out and scaling J.B. Hunt 360, I continue to be encouraged, where we are relative to our long-term plan. As we have discussed, user activity and engagement continue to accelerate and break records across both carrier and shipper platforms, solidifying the value of optimizing and transacting in real time in a frictionless process. As we look ahead to this year, we see opportunities to further acceleration, as we continue the rollout of our new automated tools and to drive even greater efficiency in our organization and higher service quality for our customers. These tools will enable, enhance and leverage our people in core technologies to drive more efficiencies in the marketplace, which gets us even closer to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. To wrap up, we continue to uncover innovative ways to accomplish that mission, including the collaborative work with Google and the recently announced strategic alliance with Waymo, where I see tremendous opportunity for us to explore solutions that merge two of the most innovative companies in the transportation industry, autonomous driving and our multimodal digital freight platform J.B. Hunt 360. That concludes my comments and I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. Today I am going to review the performance of both Final Mile and Dedicated segments, as well as provide some thoughts on the priorities for these businesses as we move forward. I will also provide some update -- updated thoughts from an operational perspective on our ability to source equipment and some updated views on the driver market. I\u2019ll start with Final Mile, as we have discussed over the last several quarters, we have been focused on making the right investments in our people and processes to ensure a high level of service quality and execution for the safe and timely delivery of our customer\u2019s products into their customers homes. That trend continued in Q4 as service quality and safety will be a cornerstone to the long-term growth and success of our business. These investments, labor challenges, as well as supply chain disruptions for some key markets that we serve have continued to weigh on margin performance in the most recent quarter, in addition to some startup costs for some newer accounts. As we set out to differentiate our service product, we have also set out to demonstrate the differentiated value we bring to our customers and the market. We believe some of that differentiation is being recognized as we are coming off our largest sales year for new business in 2021. That said, in the coming months, we do expect to put some business at risk as we focus and put even greater emphasis on generating the appropriate financial returns on these investments. Going forward, we continue to see a solid pipeline of organic growth opportunities with potential to supplement some of that growth with smaller tuck-in acquisitions as a way to build out our service capabilities and customer list. Shifting to Dedicated, our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business startups continue to build to record levels, despite the onboarding of nearly 1,800 new trucks in 2021. In terms of truck sales, we sold over 2,500 trucks of new business in the year, a new record for us or an incremental 663 units specifically in the fourth quarter. Historically, we have shared a target to sell 800 to 1,000 trucks per year, and at this point, we feel it\u2019s appropriate to update that long-term target to 1,000 to 1,200 based on our team\u2019s ability to execute. As planned or expected these startups to put near-term pressure on margin performance as those elevated driver pay and recruiting cost and specific to the quarter the special bonus we provided our frontline employees. But we remain confident in our ability to price and manage each of our accounts to the appropriate levels of profitability and returns, which should reveal itself in the coming quarters. In terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan, as well as maintaining our culture for operational excellence, high service and safety, while maintaining through some challenges around a modestly less experienced team, as our pace of growth has been robust. Closing out with some operational updates, as you could tell by my dedicated comments, there\u2019s a lot of momentum, which has us put additional pressure on our organization to source both drivers and equipment. I would say that both the truck and trailer market, as well as the driver market remain extremely tight, and does give me some concern for our ability to execute on our growth plan to meet the demands of the business. That said, we are working closely with our OEMs to get delivery of product and continue to recruit tirelessly to meet the driver demands across our organization. That concludes my remarks. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, my comments will recap the performance of our intermodal business in 2021 and specifically the fourth quarter. I will also provide an update on our significant investment to expand our capacity with our equipment orders and finish up with some thoughts about the outlook for the business in 2022 as we anticipate strong demand for our services as a result of our investments and the value of intermodal in the truck-to-rail conversion equation. I\u2019d like to start by reviewing our recent performance, demand for our intermodal service remain strong in the fourth quarter, but similar to recent trends, was it reflected in the volume performance for the business as network congestion and restrictions hindered a large amount of our potential capacity. That said, I am proud of our team and its ability to onboard the equipment available to us to ensure that we met the commitments to our customers during their peak period of demand. On a positive note, we did see improvements in the quarter in parts of the network, specifically the speed in which customers were able to turn our equipment. However, those improvements were effectively offset by further deterioration in other parts of the network, namely rail velocity. For the quarter, box turns achieved minimal improvement from the third quarter. Needless to say lots of work remains to be done. As a result volumes for the quarter were down 3% year-over-year and by month volumes were down 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 1% in December. The onboarding of new equipment was slower than we anticipated, taking delivery of only 2,700 units in the quarter and approximately half of our 12,000 orders for the year. Naturally, this will push more units into our delivery plan for the first half of 2022. This investment in additional capacity and the corresponding investment in additional trucks and chassis, and most importantly, our people puts us in a good position to serve our customers and focus on growth in 2022. In addition to these investments, we continue to work closely with our customers and rail service providers to improve velocity in the system to unlock the latent capacity in the network. Predicting the exact timing of improvement in the network fluidity is difficult, particularly in light of some of the more recent disruption caused by new COVID cases impacting our own and our customer\u2019s operations. As we look forward to the year ahead and similar to what you have heard earlier, we are optimistic about our opportunities to grow the business. We have executed a plan that puts us on a solid growth trajectory based on items within our control. Consistent with our strategy historically, we will focus on striking the right balance between volume and price, while maintaining our financial discipline on targeting appropriate returns on our business. Of course, returns and margins are impacted by items like velocity and asset utilization, which will also be a key component in terms of how we manage the business as we progress through the year. In anticipation of questions on both volume and margin expectations for the year, my answer is, it depends, but know that the business will be managed to protect our investment and our returns on that investment. In closing, intermodal\u2019s value proposition remain strong supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight, as well as transloading freight into our domestic containers. We believe our service backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to cover the performance of highway services, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions and truck. But before I do, I would just like to stop for a second and thank all the members in ICS and JBT for how they continue to rise to the occasion to deliver on behalf of our customers, particularly during what was another tight and capacity constrained peak season. You have heard us talk now for quite some time about how we plan on leveraging our investment in our people and our technology to support rapid growth in this area of our business, and as I look back on the past year, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with how this team has responded to deliver on that statement. I\u2019d like to first cover ICS or our Integrated Capacity Solution segment. We delivered $739 million of revenue in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 26%. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in revenue per load, as total loads were down 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Truckload volume was up 3% versus the prior year period. Going into peak we felt like our volume comps would decelerate based on our rapid growth a year ago from third quarter to fourth quarter, in addition to some of the discipline we instilled in our bid strategy earlier in the year, which combined with scaling and productivity benefits is reflected in our profitability improvement. As we look forward, I know our teams are excited about the rollout of two technology enhancements this year that will enable greater productivity of our people and greater service for our customers and carriers, which will support our growth and scaling of the business even further. To close out my comments on ICS, I would like to establish some priorities for the year, which include continuing to invest in and leverage our people and technology, focus on operational excellence, so customers and carriers, have a world class experience utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform and create value for customers and carriers that would support further market share gains. Shifting gears now to truck or JBT. Revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $259 million, while operating income improved to $26 million in the quarter and delivering results this segment hasn\u2019t achieved since 2005. I think it\u2019s important to highlight that our go-to-market strategy has evolved as the makeup of our truck service offering has continued to gravitate to a more asset-light model. I remain encouraged by our ability to disrupt the traditional way of serving customers in this segment to discover new and innovative ways to scale into the large addressable drop trailer markets that has normally been served by the large asset-based carriers. By leveraging the power and investments we made in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, our people and building out our 360box network and capacity, we are positioned for growth as financial return support our strategy and further investment. Similar to ICS, these investments will focus on building out further capabilities with our technology, investing more in our people and investment in our physical assets, which in this case is additional trailing capacity. We will continue to maintain our discipline on our capital allocation in this area of investment, but I am encouraged by our progress and the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in the segments. In closing, we continue to see a lot of opportunities in our highway service businesses to provide an efficient source of capacity for our customers by leveraging our investments in our people and J.B. Hunt 360, our multimodal digital freight platform. As I said last quarter, much work has been done, but much more remains, and we will stay focused on delivering on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments. So I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nOperator:  Your first question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Let me see if I can squeeze a few into one. Darren, just on the container count, it sounds like 6,000 containers getting pushed into first half of the year. Are you adding additional containers beyond that in the second half of the year, where do you expect to end? And then just from a pricing and margin standpoint, any directional color on how much of the yield is accessorial and as long as this environment stays tight like this, now that you are above 12% from a margin standpoint you think you\u2019ll stay above 12%?\nDarren Field: Well, my goodness, Scott, you managed multiple questions there and good morning to you Scott. I don\u2019t know where you are, but if its morning there, I don\u2019t want to be hanging with you. So, listen, yeah, we -- we are not satisfied with the flow of the new equipment in the fourth quarter. Certainly delays in the transportation of that equipment impacted us and that has pushed 6,000 into 2022. We are going to add capacity in 2022 beyond those. We are not prepared to release a number like that today. As it relates to accessorial and whatnot, I anticipated this question, of course, and really only one answer at one time today. We are not going to tell you how much was accessorial and how much was core pricing. We set out, I think every time I have been on an earnings call, I have talked about our focus on pricing to return profile. That continues to be the case. Certainly in 2021 we experienced some unusual characteristics and the equipment utilization was hampered, and we took action, and certainly, that had -- has -- is part of our results in the fourth quarter. But we also had meaningful cost to recover in the pricing cycle last year. 2020 saw really significant cost increases that we experienced and we were able to communicate that with customers and certainly recovered some of those costs. We certainly have additional pressure on driver wages, and we are constantly talking to both our customers and rail providers about the need for velocity improvements in our assets. So as we have always done, we will price for a return profile. There are probably times if utilization of our equipment is difficult, it may require a slightly higher margin, because utilization is hurt. But certainly as we can get benefits or better velocity on an equipment maybe the same margin requirement isn\u2019t there. We issued long-term margin guidance of 10% to 12%, and for the calendar year 2021, we hit an 89 order  and 11% margin. So we are right in the middle of our long-term guidance and I certainly would anticipate in 2022 we are able to continue growing, while also pricing in an effort to recover cost exposure that we have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning or evening, I guess. On J.B. Hunt 360, certainly unique environment and the business has grown or the technology has expanded. Has this environment at all altered, I know you are talking -- you are in that path with long-term goals, but has this environment altered kind of where you want to take that offering as you go forward, is there new opportunities or needs that are out there that you think you could pursue with that?\nShelley Simpson: Hi. Good morning and good afternoon. This is Shelley. I\u2019ll try to take that. Certainly, the more that we are working with our customers and transportation providers, the more opportunities that we are seeing, hence the announcement we just made recently with Waymo. I think that there is a great opportunity to eliminate the inefficiency that\u2019s happening in the market. Our customers are helping us drive that strategy or carriers are helping us drive that strategy. As we said in our opening remarks, we are pleased with the progress, we are ahead of schedule. But we do have new ideas on the roadmap and continue to want to explore this if there\u2019s anything that logically adjacent our customers are asking us and that we can give a proper return to it, something we are going to investigate and continue to move forward with our mission.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the $11 million special bonus. Could you give us some additional color on how that was spread out across the different segments? And then in Dedicated, as we look at margins and how they have progressed sequentially that bonus maybe part of the 4Q decline. But I am guessing a lot of it\u2019s coming from the significant amount of fleet additions you have made sequentially in the last couple of quarters? So as we think about the growth in Dedicated going forward, at what point do you think we can get back to that targeted margin range of 12% to 14%?\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Justin. This is Brad. I\u2019ll give you the numbers and then kick it over to Nick to give you response to the second part of your question. Intermodal JBI the impact was $3.4 million, DCS the impact was $5.9 million, ICS was 100,000, FMS was 900,000 and JBT was 400,000 for a total of $10.7 million.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah. Justin, this is Nick. I\u2019ll just tell you that we feel very good about our ability to operate in that range. When I look at just our base business, we are clearly operating in that range. I can\u2019t predict the future. I can just tell you that our pipeline is much larger today than it was last January. So if I could tell you when the demand will back off on the amount of add that we have coming, I can tell you when our margins will get back down there. On the base business, there is a slight impact just from driver wages that we are seeing. Just from a timing of 80% of our business has indexes in it, so the timing of whom we may have to give a driver wage as opposed to whom we implement that rate increase in the index could be off just a little bit, that impacts us, but our view is, we take care of the customer for the long-term and not put business at risk just for two or three months of rate increase. So we feel very solid about our base business and how it\u2019s performing. We are excited about the new business that it\u2019s coming out and doing well. So we just barely got outside the range for the year. So I think that\u2019s pretty good, if I look at that with over -- adding over 1,800 trucks and selling over 2,500.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Darren, in the last call you said you implemented some programs that better encourage equipment turns and then you noted earlier in your prepared remarks that you are seeing some of the benefits there, but it\u2019s effectively being offset, like some of the rail velocity? Where do you think you are on these initiatives, so that if rail service does and we all hope it does, it\u2019s back to quote-unquote normal in the next month or so you can really see an inflection in those box turns, especially as you are onboarding the rest of those 12,000 that you didn\u2019t get in 2021?\nDarren Field: Well, I mean, certainly, we did see some minor improvement in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. But minor, I mean, very, very minor effectively flat. And then we highlighted that rail velocity took a little bit of a step back in the fourth quarter, like you said, we would anticipate rail velocity to have some improvements. I know that all of our rail providers want nothing more than for velocity to improve. So I am confident that the efforts underway. As that takes hold, there is really significant capacity available in the market from Intermodal to move more loads. The good news is, demand remains extremely strong. We have customer business that we could have onboarded in the fourth quarter that we weren\u2019t able to because of a slowdown in velocity and capacity. So we remain really bullish on our opportunity to fill up that capacity in the combination of new containers coming onboard and a return to maybe pre-pandemic velocity statistics, we really feel strongly that we have a lot of demand. And we see that in other parts of our business, there is business operating inside the J.B. Hunt enterprise today then Intermodal is the correct solution for, but in 2021 truckload remained a solution, maybe it was a transit time requirement for that customer or a lack of capacity in the market from intermodal, but both of those factors play a role in a lot of confidence we have is the ability to grow as velocity improves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey. Thanks. Darren, just on intermodal volume, is there a better opportunity to access rail capacity on the be end this year, because it maybe some of the market share shifts that have occurred. Could you just talk about what impact that has, if any on your ability to grow volumes? And then, I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing question earlier, you talk about cost and pricing for cost, but obviously, it\u2019s a very tight market, fuel costs are up. I am just trying to understand what you think the market based pricing opportunity is this year and do you think that market opportunity allows for double-digit pricing growth for contracts that come up in 2022? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Okay. Well, the market is going to answer that question for us. We are certainly always out there competing. We are aware of prices that are winning business and we are aware of prices that are losing business in the competition. And so certainly if the market presents an opportunity for double-digit increases, I would tell you my experience always says that, without cost increases, it\u2019s not likely that double-digit rate increases present themselves without significant cost pressure. It would be -- I would consider a highly unusual for our rates to climb in the double-digit range without corresponding cost challenges coming out of the market. Those are going to dominate with driver wage predominantly, but certainly, the asset utilization is also playing a role.\nJohn Roberts: And Amit, what was the second part of your question, I am sorry. Do we address both of them...\nAmit Mehrotra: Capacity on BNSF?\nDarren Field: Oh! Capacity on BNSF. Let me just, we are aware of another channel that certainly left BNSF and went to Union Pacific, and certainly, that presents an opportunity, I mean, those lifts were occurring on BNSF, we are aligned with BNSF in a growth strategy, we have discussions with BNSF daily about our efforts to grow together and we have a lot of focus in that area in 2022.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Hey. Thank you, Operator. Good evening, everybody. I wanted to look a little bit at the volume growth on the intermodal side. Clearly, you were impacted price, some of the congestion on the rails and the supply chain. What -- if you would have to put it in the numbers context, what percentage impact would you think it would had on the volumes in 2021? I am just trying to frame it so how we can think about it this clears up? What kind of opportunity presents itself in 2022 and beyond?\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Jason. This is Brad. I will -- I mean, I\u2019ll take a crack at that. But we don\u2019t give specific targets or guidance or haven\u2019t set an expectation of what realistic intermodal turns are. But if you assume we have been running mid-1.6 to low 1.6 on monthly box turns and assume, I don\u2019t know 1.8, 1.85, which is probably where we were running pre-pandemic. That\u2019s probably an approximate way to get to a number that says what the opportunity is, if we got back to those pre-pandemic velocity levels that supply chain was moving from both our customer and rail capacity service perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks everyone. This is not a 2022 guidance question, I promise. But just on ICS, is that now structurally a 3% to 4% of margin business kind of irrespective of what the cycle does or kind of if spot rates do rollover next year or kind of could that margin be under pressure? And also as a follow-up on the accessorials, can you confirm that the accessorials, again I know you won\u2019t quantify it, but was it higher or lower sequentially in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter? Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Okay. Ravi, I\u2019ll start and maybe let Darren speak to the accessorial component there at the end. This is Brad Hicks. We don\u2019t give guidance. I do think that if you go back in the last two full years, we made substantial investments in the business, both in people and technology that will allow for scale and leveraging of the platform. We continue on that journey. We are satisfied with the progress that we have made, but we still have work to do. So I would anticipate that we would stay on a positive trajectory as we go forward, because we are seeing the benefits of the tech investments both through leverage, through efficiency gains and I think you can see that from our overall growth and results over the last several quarters. And so, we are certainly encouraged, but we -- as I said in my prepared comments, we are not satisfied yet and we have work to do, but I do think that we have continued to show progress and we\u2019ll continue to show progress towards our long-term objectives.\nDarren Field: On the accessorial question, sorry, Ravi, we are just not going to answer that question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you can just give us a broader perspective of the challenges in labor, hiring and retention. I think it was mentioned you made some pretty significant changes across multiple areas. So it maybe helpful if you can run through some of the availability and wage pressures and challenges that you are seeing across the warehouses, terminals, drayage? And then specifically, it sounds like Dedicated might be more of a short-term impact with some of the unseated truck challenges you have right now, which seems to be somewhat unique for your business, that\u2019s been growing pretty well over the last couple of years. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Brian. This is Brad and I\u2019ll let Nick address the driver side of that and then Shelley kind of address the broader organization side of that question. So\u2026\nNick Hobbs: Hi, Brian. Yeah. We are -- driver wages are up significantly pretty much in every division. Again, we don\u2019t do anything across the Board. It\u2019s by site, by location. But our cost per hire is up. We have seen higher sign on bonuses and the market is very, very difficult with the drivers being out there facing COVID. We have a higher percent of our fleet with COVID right now than we have had at any other time. They are not as severe but more off. So we are seeing an impact on that. We are seeing impacts on our orientation, because of COVID home scheduled versus what actually shows. So we are seeing some short-term impacts there. But we think, we have addressed the driver market pretty well, but it still takes a little bit longer to fill up trucks in our startups when we startup even if they are priced appropriately and with as many as we have starting up that\u2019s continued to be a challenge. So the other thing is just on the tech side, we are facing a lot of pressure on the maintenance tech side in the shops as well and that affects some of our turn times and getting equipment turn. So, there\u2019s just a constant new challenges that we are facing all the time around wages and we are facing some wage pressure in the shop as well that we are addressing. So I\u2019ll talk -- that will do it for me, I\u2019ll let Shelley talk about the office side of things.\nShelley Simpson: Yeah. When we work just comprehensively around all of our labor challenges, we really moved from a defensive mode with what\u2019s happened with COVID to an offensive mode and it\u2019s really allowing us to move forward and think about the investments we need to make for growth for our customers. So we have looked across all of compensation and starting with our benefits package and there were specific changes that we made to our benefits, as well as total rewards whether that was in benefit or also what happened from a short-term cash incentive to also long-term incentives as well. And so we have had a more comprehensive approach, really probably for our first time in quite some time across the entire organization from drivers to our maintenance technicians and our office employees. We are leaning in. We are on the offensive side of that, really preparing for growth inside all of our segments and in all of our support group. So it\u2019s something that we see happening here at the first of this year. We have been investing into our labor all of last year. But as Darren talked about our cost and us really trying to line out our price to what\u2019s happening in costs. We have tried to be offensive in that to make sure we have drivers, make sure we have our maintenance technicians and make sure that we have our office employees ready, equipped and available to help our customers.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Thanks. Maybe for Darren, can we talk a little bit about the fleet again in intermodal? I just wanted to get a sense of, based on what you are seeing on the ocean today, how many boxes you think you might expect in 1Q and 2Q out of that 6,000 and then I know there\u2019s a lot of variables out there about 2022 and that\u2019s fine. I guess, given how strong the demand environment sounds for Intermodal services, assuming you get the boxes and you have some greater fluidity in the market, how many boxes would you want to grow beyond the 6,000 in 2022. What would be sort of what you see like the market opportunity for you that you can grow into?\nDarren Field: Man, Chris, that\u2019s the magic question, isn\u2019t it. So we have -- we certainly -- we have a meaningful percentage of those 6,000 that are literally on vessels either at anchor waiting to unload or in some form of transportation. I don\u2019t know that we have decided yet to break out how many. I think it\u2019s a fair assumption to just spread those 6,000 more or less evenly over the first half of the year. If we can move them in faster than that, we will. I am aware that I have given direction on this call for the last two calls of equipment count expectations and we haven\u2019t met either of those. So I don\u2019t want to give too much out there, but certainly we are trying to get all of that equipment here just as soon as we can. I think that with all of the talk of velocity challenges in 2021, we are going to be a little bit careful watching what comes from velocity improvements. I mean, there is really a lot of growth capacity in the system we have today plus the 6,000 boxes yet to be received, we can really grow a lot. We have a lot of confidence in our rail providers and our rail network and our ability to grow business there. In the event if velocity can\u2019t improve, then certainly we have to go buy more equipment in an effort to grow at the same pace, but that will come with sort of new challenges. So I don\u2019t have an answer for you on how many we would like to have. We would like to have as many as we can fill up to be honest and there\u2019s no great answer to that question, but certainly we have tremendous growth opportunities with our customers. We are confident in the demand equation out there and we know that if we can improve velocity, we can grow in a hurry and in the event that we can\u2019t improve velocity then we\u2019ll have to go secure more containers and grow that way.\nShelley Simpson: Chris, could take up one level just for our customers overall. I would say, demand is very strong across all of our services and so whether it\u2019s in container adds, 360box adds or adds in Dedicated or Final Mile, our customers are asking us to grow. We are really walking through either bid season or communication in those conversations in Dedicated and Final Mile to help us determine what we should do and then we want to have a balanced approach, making sure that we do what we say with our customers on our commitments and grow as much as possible with proper financial return. So bid season so far has gone well. We\u2019ll continue to get through bid season to help us refine what that can look like across all of our segments.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. So curious from a very high level standpoint relative to, let\u2019s say, I don\u2019t know, early December. Are you -- would you say you are more or less optimistic on the whole supply chain congestion issue using, let\u2019s say, over the first half or is it just keep pushing later? And then just a clarification on Dedicated fleet, given what you said on purchases and sales, are we looking at a Dedicated fleet down in 2022 versus the fourth quarter of 2021? Thanks.\nBrad Hicks: Yeah. Hey, Jordan, this is Brad. I\u2019ll -- I am going to ask Shelley to address the first part of your question about our view on, just to rehash your question. Our outlook on the supply chain today versus maybe where is -- where it was early December? And then to the second part of your question about Dedicated and fleet additions, I\u2019ll let Nick address that.\nShelley Simpson: So I would say throughout all of 2020 and 2021, when we would make a prediction typically we were wrong. And so, although, I would like to be optimistic, I think, this latest round of COVID has caught everyone by surprise. So I can\u2019t say that I feel optimistic about the supply chain challenges going away in the near-term. We are focused on making sure that we help our customers be right to help them smooth out their supply chain challenges and that we are there for them. I would say, any time there is more crisis in the supply chain, our moat agnostic solutions really come to the forefront, because we are fairly indifferent as to how we solve for our customers. We wrap around our customers, solve for us and then continue to move business. So for us we are going to be there for them. I can\u2019t really say if we are optimistic or not, because I am not certain what lies ahead, but we are planning for that, we are on the offensive side as I have said earlier on equipment, on people and on technology we think we can serve our customers that even more so this year, the last year.\nNick Hobbs: And I will just say that we have sold 2,500 trucks and we started about 1,800 of them, and so that means we have got a significant amount to start already in the hopper before we sell anything this year. We are waiting on some trailing equipment to start some stuff. But we are holding trades and doing various other things on the power side. So, I would say, Q1 is going to be just like the last two, three quarters for us. Right in that ballpark is where we think it\u2019s going to be from a number standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Good afternoon. John, you mentioned CapEx, but I think it was about $1.5 billion, if you are at what net $877 million, you said $150 million rolls over. Can you kind of walk us through how you get to the $1.5 billion where -- how you see that step up? And then Brad just real quick as a clean up, I think, you mentioned, some new tech at ICS, should we expect cost to step up there and see margin pressure or is that just blended into the cost?\nJohn Kuhlow: Hey, Ken. This is John. I\u2019ll give a little bit of color on the CapEx. We are not really in a position to give too much detail. But of the $1.5 billion, I would say, around 10% is for general corporate purposes, building enhancements and things like that. The rest is probably split evenly between trucks and trailing equipment, and by trailing equipment, I mean containers, I mean Dedicated trailers and also 360box, so that\u2019s probably around $700 million. And then the rest is on tractors and that\u2019s another $700 million and again not going to give too much color on that, but that includes both replacement and growth for 2022. And then I would just like to add what we did comment, we gave some guidance for the last couple of quarters on what we thought CapEx would be. We have also given for full year 2022. That\u2019s based on both what we want to order, but also what we think we can get. And so there is certainly a lot of noise and uncertainty as the OEMs are trying to meet their plans and get us the equipment we need. We\u2019ll continue to update on our progress there. But just know that there is risk in that number based on what we can get in place and service.\nJohn Roberts: And then, Ken, on part two there, the technology enhancements, it\u2019s really on the tail of the investment that we have been making. And what I am referencing there is that we will be deploying some internal tools that will allow and should allow for our peoples productivity to be improved, which we would expect will allow us to advance our strategy as we move forward. And so, I am just really excited about finally getting done with some of those tools that we are going to be able to utilize to make better decisions, to make decisions faster and to enhance overall productivity of our workforce.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good afternoon. So, I wanted to ask, I think, it seems to me like there is a pretty consensus view out there that there\u2019ll be some supply chain improvement through the year, I share that view. I wanted to get your sense of what if that\u2019s wrong and we don\u2019t see supply chain improvement and you kind of have a repeat of 2021, where things are pretty congested through the year, what does that look like for J.B. Hunt? And then just maybe short second question, what\u2019s your best read on gross margin percent for ICS in 2022, should we kind of think of it is stable is maybe the base case or any thoughts on that? Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: I feel like I have answered some of this before. I think we are in a great position for our customers. We did make the call early in 2021 to add more equipment to lean in and you are seeing that equipment now starting to come online. So I think we are in a great position with our customers, we are going to continue to be very close with them and make sure that we can answer whatever our customer\u2019s needs are. In 2021 more than any other year, I saw as be able to move freight from our customers. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily have moved in that mode or that type of shipment in the past. When a customer had a shipment, we could say, yes. J.B. Hunt 360 allowed for a lot of that, but also the interconnectivity of all of our segments, working very closely together, understanding where capacity was that and how we could help our customers. I don\u2019t see a lot of negative impacts for our organization if it were to say congested add is, we are already set up for the add is and we are continuing to talk closely with our customers. When you say that there is consensus that it\u2019s going to get a lot better, I am not sure how much that consensus is optimism versus reality and I think that that\u2019s really key questions that we are asking our customers. Certainly, we want to help our customers get better. We want to help them be more plan and help them reduce cost in their supply chain in total. But if nothing changes from today, we\u2019ll continue to lean into our customers, we\u2019ll continue to ask them, how we can help them more and we will make more bets on how we can help them through our people, technology and our equipment.\nJohn Roberts: And then, as we have stated, we are not interested in giving guidance around return -- our return expectations are for the year. I think that we are early in bid season. We are going to need to see what the market does and how it continues to respond to the work that we have been doing. If you look back over the last several years going back to 2018, I am at least encouraged that we have returns closely to a profitability level we saw before the heavy lift tech investments, but we are not inside of our desired long-term range yet at this point. So we are working every day. The technology that I just referenced is hopeful to aid us in that and we would anticipate and expect to continue on our journey towards the 4%, 6% range that we stated previously.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question, which will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for putting me here at the end. So, Shelley, I guess, if I could just follow up on that or maybe for Brad, it looks like headcount was actually down in ICS and core truckload growth maybe 3%. Could you just talk about the market dynamics there and has this more of a level of maturity that we are contemplating maybe a year and a half ago or is there still a lot more to go on that platform?\nBrad Hicks: Really what it comes down to is that the headcount that you see there is direct to the business and because of how we have managed and restructured over time. There are some headcounts that support the business that are not inside of the BU. And so, I would say that, obviously, we are leveraging technology in an effort to grow headcount at a disproportionate level to the growth of the business and that\u2019s really what our focus is and we are satisfied with the progression we have seen there, perhaps, the numbers that are published aren\u2019t entirely revealing of the total headcount inside the organization that supports the business.\nOperator: And this will conclude our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over to CEO, John Roberts for closing remarks at this time.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. And I\u2019d like to first say, I appreciate a much more balanced discussion here today. Though we still have work to do, I kept a little score here on the questions that were asked for our different leaders and I am encouraged and we\u2019ll continue in that vein. I would say the two big takeaways are that the businesses are all lined up, well positioned, look to grow, look to continue the momentum that we have. And then, collectively, because of that individual strength we have a compounded strength that, I like the question, what if does it does it get better? And when Shelley was answering that question, I was thinking to myself, okay, so that means we keep doing what we are doing here. We have learned how to do that. But if you look at the strength that we are demonstrating through this pandemic, through this supply chain disruption, with really a fairly simple focus on invest for customers, serve customers, generate the right amount of return and then invest for our customers again. We don\u2019t really have a predisposition to one element or another as we continue to move down this road of being agnostic. We just want to answer that question. And I think our momentum with the customer base is continuing to gain strength that they are appreciate that we will invest for them in equipment, they appreciate that we will pivot away from an equipment investment, it\u2019s a better answer presents itself. So closing out the year we were thrilled with the year, we were thrilled to get to pay our people a special bonus. And I\u2019d just close by saying that people focus is really where it\u2019s at for us. I have never seen the kind of exhaustive work that we have done this year to understand our position and balance that against risks of not taking action versus taking action and then thinking about how we need to make those investments return for us, the same way we think about our assets. But we have great tech, we have great assets and equipment, but our people are the difference. They -- and I know that\u2019s a little bit cliche to some of us, but I am telling you that when it gets down to push and shove, our folks are going to be there, they are going to get the job done. What will this year bring, we\u2019ll see. We thank you for your call and your attention today.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to cover the performance of highway services, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions and truck. But before I do, I would just like to stop for a second and thank all the members in ICS and JBT for how they continue to rise to the occasion to deliver on behalf of our customers, particularly during what was another tight and capacity constrained peak season. You have heard us talk now for quite some time about how we plan on leveraging our investment in our people and our technology to support rapid growth in this area of our business, and as I look back on the past year, I couldn't be more pleased with how this team has responded to deliver on that statement. I'd like to first cover ICS or our Integrated Capacity Solution segment. We delivered $739 million of revenue in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 26%. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in revenue per load, as total loads were down 1% year-over-year in the quarter. Truckload volume was up 3% versus the prior year period. Going into peak we felt like our volume comps would decelerate based on our rapid growth a year ago from third quarter to fourth quarter, in addition to some of the discipline we instilled in our bid strategy earlier in the year, which combined with scaling and productivity benefits is reflected in our profitability improvement. As we look forward, I know our teams are excited about the rollout of two technology enhancements this year that will enable greater productivity of our people and greater service for our customers and carriers, which will support our growth and scaling of the business even further. To close out my comments on ICS, I would like to establish some priorities for the year, which include continuing to invest in and leverage our people and technology, focus on operational excellence, so customers and carriers, have a world class experience utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform and create value for customers and carriers that would support further market share gains. Shifting gears now to truck or JBT. Revenue grew 85% year-over-year to $259 million, while operating income improved to $26 million in the quarter and delivering results this segment hasn't achieved since 2005. I think it's important to highlight that our go-to-market strategy has evolved as the makeup of our truck service offering has continued to gravitate to a more asset-light model. I remain encouraged by our ability to disrupt the traditional way of serving customers in this segment to discover new and innovative ways to scale into the large addressable drop trailer markets that has normally been served by the large asset-based carriers. By leveraging the power and investments we made in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, our people and building out our 360box network and capacity, we are positioned for growth as financial return support our strategy and further investment. Similar to ICS, these investments will focus on building out further capabilities with our technology, investing more in our people and investment in our physical assets, which in this case is additional trailing capacity. We will continue to maintain our discipline on our capital allocation in this area of investment, but I am encouraged by our progress and the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in the segments. In closing, we continue to see a lot of opportunities in our highway service businesses to provide an efficient source of capacity for our customers by leveraging our investments in our people and J.B. Hunt 360, our multimodal digital freight platform. As I said last quarter, much work has been done, but much more remains, and we will stay focused on delivering on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn it back over to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Hey, Justin. This is Brad. I'll give you the numbers and then kick it over to Nick to give you response to the second part of your question. Intermodal JBI the impact was $3.4 million, DCS the impact was $5.9 million, ICS was 100,000, FMS was 900,000 and JBT was 400,000 for a total of $10.7 million. Hey, Jason. This is Brad. I will -- I mean, I'll take a crack at that. But we don't give specific targets or guidance or haven't set an expectation of what realistic intermodal turns are. But if you assume we have been running mid-1.6 to low 1.6 on monthly box turns and assume, I don't know 1.8, 1.85, which is probably where we were running pre-pandemic. That's probably an approximate way to get to a number that says what the opportunity is, if we got back to those pre-pandemic velocity levels that supply chain was moving from both our customer and rail capacity service perspective. Okay. Ravi, I'll start and maybe let Darren speak to the accessorial component there at the end. This is Brad Hicks. We don't give guidance. I do think that if you go back in the last two full years, we made substantial investments in the business, both in people and technology that will allow for scale and leveraging of the platform. We continue on that journey. We are satisfied with the progress that we have made, but we still have work to do. So I would anticipate that we would stay on a positive trajectory as we go forward, because we are seeing the benefits of the tech investments both through leverage, through efficiency gains and I think you can see that from our overall growth and results over the last several quarters. And so, we are certainly encouraged, but we -- as I said in my prepared comments, we are not satisfied yet and we have work to do, but I do think that we have continued to show progress and we'll continue to show progress towards our long-term objectives. Hey, Brian. This is Brad and I'll let Nick address the driver side of that and then Shelley kind of address the broader organization side of that question. So... Yeah. Hey, Jordan, this is Brad. I'll -- I am going to ask Shelley to address the first part of your question about our view on, just to rehash your question. Our outlook on the supply chain today versus maybe where is -- where it was early December? And then to the second part of your question about Dedicated and fleet additions, I'll let Nick address that. Really what it comes down to is that the headcount that you see there is direct to the business and because of how we have managed and restructured over time. There are some headcounts that support the business that are not inside of the BU. And so, I would say that, obviously, we are leveraging technology in an effort to grow headcount at a disproportionate level to the growth of the business and that's really what our focus is and we are satisfied with the progression we have seen there, perhaps, the numbers that are published aren't entirely revealing of the total headcount inside the organization that supports the business."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will follow a similar pattern as our previous calls, where I'll review our recent performance on a consolidated level. I'll then provide some commentary on our CapEx plans for 2022, and as well as our approach to capital allocation and then I'll close with some thoughts on our financial priorities for the coming year. Overall, we were pleased with our fourth quarter performance, highlighted by growing revenues 28% and operating income 55% over the prior year period. We saw positive year-over-year revenue performance across all segments and positive operating income performance in all segments, except for DCS, which Nick will cover in greater detail in his remarks. As I look across our business, the common denominator in terms of our pain points continues to be labor related and wages, salaries, benefits, and recruiting trends, in both driver and non-driver. We continue to elevate investments in our people, as was evidenced by our decision to provide a special bonus in December of nearly $11 million to our frontline workers for their efforts in working through the supply chain challenges facing our customers and the industry. Below the line interest expense was slightly lower and the tax rate slightly higher than the prior period, resulting in GAAP EPS of $2.28 a share. For the quarter were 58% increase versus the prior year period. As has been stated in previous calls, the impacts of network congestion, labor shortages and general supply chain challenges are well known and have continued to have a meaningful impact on our business and are likely to persist, particularly given the heightened challenges evolving around COVID infections across our country. We ended the quarter with $356 million of cash, which was slightly higher than plan. Last quarter, I provided you with updated thoughts on our 2021 net CapEx and that would fall within the $1 billion range, which we missed by approximately $130 million. This miss was almost entirely due to supply chain delays contained to impact our ability to take timely delivery of our equipment. We remain committed to these investments and capacity to help serve our customers, and we anticipate net CapEx for 2022 to approximately $1.5 billion. We continue to prioritize our capital to invest in our business, support our dividend, repurchase, shares and opportunistically execute on our M&A strategy, all while maintaining a modest net leverage ratio of around 1 times EBITDA, and importantly, continuing to maintain our investment grade status. Before I close out my comments and in light of expecting some questions around our 2022 outlook, I'd like to provide you some context, not guidance, but contacts for our financial priorities in 2022. These priorities include, continuing investments in our people, maintaining a strong balance sheet to support all of our plans investments and focusing on generating appropriate returns on the capital we are investing to grow our businesses and serve our customers. This discipline focus on the priorities enables us to manage the business for long-term growth and success. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it over to Shelley. Hey, Ken. This is John. I'll give a little bit of color on the CapEx. We are not really in a position to give too much detail. But of the $1.5 billion, I would say, around 10% is for general corporate purposes, building enhancements and things like that. The rest is probably split evenly between trucks and trailing equipment, and by trailing equipment, I mean containers, I mean Dedicated trailers and also 360box, so that's probably around $700 million. And then the rest is on tractors and that's another $700 million and again not going to give too much color on that, but that includes both replacement and growth for 2022. And then I would just like to add what we did comment, we gave some guidance for the last couple of quarters on what we thought CapEx would be. We have also given for full year 2022. That's based on both what we want to order, but also what we think we can get. And so there is certainly a lot of noise and uncertainty as the OEMs are trying to meet their plans and get us the equipment we need. We'll continue to update on our progress there. But just know that there is risk in that number based on what we can get in place and service."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon. Today I am going to review the performance of both Final Mile and Dedicated segments, as well as provide some thoughts on the priorities for these businesses as we move forward. I will also provide some update -- updated thoughts from an operational perspective on our ability to source equipment and some updated views on the driver market. I'll start with Final Mile, as we have discussed over the last several quarters, we have been focused on making the right investments in our people and processes to ensure a high level of service quality and execution for the safe and timely delivery of our customer's products into their customers homes. That trend continued in Q4 as service quality and safety will be a cornerstone to the long-term growth and success of our business. These investments, labor challenges, as well as supply chain disruptions for some key markets that we serve have continued to weigh on margin performance in the most recent quarter, in addition to some startup costs for some newer accounts. As we set out to differentiate our service product, we have also set out to demonstrate the differentiated value we bring to our customers and the market. We believe some of that differentiation is being recognized as we are coming off our largest sales year for new business in 2021. That said, in the coming months, we do expect to put some business at risk as we focus and put even greater emphasis on generating the appropriate financial returns on these investments. Going forward, we continue to see a solid pipeline of organic growth opportunities with potential to supplement some of that growth with smaller tuck-in acquisitions as a way to build out our service capabilities and customer list. Shifting to Dedicated, our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business startups continue to build to record levels, despite the onboarding of nearly 1,800 new trucks in 2021. In terms of truck sales, we sold over 2,500 trucks of new business in the year, a new record for us or an incremental 663 units specifically in the fourth quarter. Historically, we have shared a target to sell 800 to 1,000 trucks per year, and at this point, we feel it's appropriate to update that long-term target to 1,000 to 1,200 based on our team's ability to execute. As planned or expected these startups to put near-term pressure on margin performance as those elevated driver pay and recruiting cost and specific to the quarter the special bonus we provided our frontline employees. But we remain confident in our ability to price and manage each of our accounts to the appropriate levels of profitability and returns, which should reveal itself in the coming quarters. In terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan, as well as maintaining our culture for operational excellence, high service and safety, while maintaining through some challenges around a modestly less experienced team, as our pace of growth has been robust. Closing out with some operational updates, as you could tell by my dedicated comments, there's a lot of momentum, which has us put additional pressure on our organization to source both drivers and equipment. I would say that both the truck and trailer market, as well as the driver market remain extremely tight, and does give me some concern for our ability to execute on our growth plan to meet the demands of the business. That said, we are working closely with our OEMs to get delivery of product and continue to recruit tirelessly to meet the driver demands across our organization. That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Darren. Yeah. Justin, this is Nick. I'll just tell you that we feel very good about our ability to operate in that range. When I look at just our base business, we are clearly operating in that range. I can't predict the future. I can just tell you that our pipeline is much larger today than it was last January. So if I could tell you when the demand will back off on the amount of add that we have coming, I can tell you when our margins will get back down there. On the base business, there is a slight impact just from driver wages that we are seeing. Just from a timing of 80% of our business has indexes in it, so the timing of whom we may have to give a driver wage as opposed to whom we implement that rate increase in the index could be off just a little bit, that impacts us, but our view is, we take care of the customer for the long-term and not put business at risk just for two or three months of rate increase. So we feel very solid about our base business and how it's performing. We are excited about the new business that it's coming out and doing well. So we just barely got outside the range for the year. So I think that's pretty good, if I look at that with over -- adding over 1,800 trucks and selling over 2,500. Hi, Brian. Yeah. We are -- driver wages are up significantly pretty much in every division. Again, we don't do anything across the Board. It's by site, by location. But our cost per hire is up. We have seen higher sign on bonuses and the market is very, very difficult with the drivers being out there facing COVID. We have a higher percent of our fleet with COVID right now than we have had at any other time. They are not as severe but more off. So we are seeing an impact on that. We are seeing impacts on our orientation, because of COVID home scheduled versus what actually shows. So we are seeing some short-term impacts there. But we think, we have addressed the driver market pretty well, but it still takes a little bit longer to fill up trucks in our startups when we startup even if they are priced appropriately and with as many as we have starting up that's continued to be a challenge. So the other thing is just on the tech side, we are facing a lot of pressure on the maintenance tech side in the shops as well and that affects some of our turn times and getting equipment turn. So, there's just a constant new challenges that we are facing all the time around wages and we are facing some wage pressure in the shop as well that we are addressing. So I'll talk -- that will do it for me, I'll let Shelley talk about the office side of things. And I will just say that we have sold 2,500 trucks and we started about 1,800 of them, and so that means we have got a significant amount to start already in the hopper before we sell anything this year. We are waiting on some trailing equipment to start some stuff. But we are holding trades and doing various other things on the power side. So, I would say, Q1 is going to be just like the last two, three quarters for us. Right in that ballpark is where we think it's going to be from a number standpoint."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. Today I want my commercial update to focus first on a quick review of 2021 and how we were able to deliver for our customers. I will then focus my comments on the market and how we are going to approach the ongoing supply chain challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Finally, I'll finish up with some updates on our priorities for J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform as we move forward. As we have discussed over the past year, the freight environment has been extremely volatile and unpredictable, and not just for capacity providers, but also for those that we are providing capacity for to meet their needs. And this environment we as an organization like our customers have had to adapt to this disruption and I firmly believe that our moat agnostic comprehensive supply chain solutions approach has been a key to help our customers over the last year, where we were able to honor our commitments in particularly during peak season. Another key element of our success was a significant commitment and investment in physical assets across all of our business segments, from containers and chassis to trucks and trailers. That said, I would be remiss to leave out the most critical element of our success and that is our people, our drivers, mechanics, load planners and all of those behind the scenes, helping our frontline workers succeed. Tying it all together, of course, was our technology platform J.B. Hunt 360, which I believe gives us a distinct advantage and sourcing efficient capacity for our customers. Simply put, our investments, people and technology put us in a position to say yes in 2021 and has me excited for our future growth as more and more customers are leaning in. As we look at the market today and tried to prepare for the year ahead, many components of our business plan and go-to-market strategy are similar to those exercise here in our recent past. The market remains challenging, capacity constrained and unpredictable, and we will need to remain agile in our approach to securing capacity for our customers. Some unique areas as the impacting capacity is the ability to source new equipment, which is likely to keep used truck prices elevated, and as a result, small carrier rates as well. I see customers wanting to lock up more capacity in Dedicated arrangements and lean into technologies that drive efficiency in their supply chain and how they procure capacity. As an organization, we see tremendous pent-up demand to convert highway freight to intermodal with elevated truck rates, the tight labor market, higher fuel prices and a 60% improvement in carbon efficiency intermodal offers versus truck. Needless to say, 2022 will present us with many opportunities to grow and we will approach the market similar to how we always have, serving our customers as our top priority, while maintaining sound financial discipline. Finally, as I look at the investments we have made building out and scaling J.B. Hunt 360, I continue to be encouraged, where we are relative to our long-term plan. As we have discussed, user activity and engagement continue to accelerate and break records across both carrier and shipper platforms, solidifying the value of optimizing and transacting in real time in a frictionless process. As we look ahead to this year, we see opportunities to further acceleration, as we continue the rollout of our new automated tools and to drive even greater efficiency in our organization and higher service quality for our customers. These tools will enable, enhance and leverage our people in core technologies to drive more efficiencies in the marketplace, which gets us even closer to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. To wrap up, we continue to uncover innovative ways to accomplish that mission, including the collaborative work with Google and the recently announced strategic alliance with Waymo, where I see tremendous opportunity for us to explore solutions that merge two of the most innovative companies in the transportation industry, autonomous driving and our multimodal digital freight platform J.B. Hunt 360. That concludes my comments and I'd now like to turn it over to Nick. Hi. Good morning and good afternoon. This is Shelley. I'll try to take that. Certainly, the more that we are working with our customers and transportation providers, the more opportunities that we are seeing, hence the announcement we just made recently with Waymo. I think that there is a great opportunity to eliminate the inefficiency that's happening in the market. Our customers are helping us drive that strategy or carriers are helping us drive that strategy. As we said in our opening remarks, we are pleased with the progress, we are ahead of schedule. But we do have new ideas on the roadmap and continue to want to explore this if there's anything that logically adjacent our customers are asking us and that we can give a proper return to it, something we are going to investigate and continue to move forward with our mission. Yeah. When we work just comprehensively around all of our labor challenges, we really moved from a defensive mode with what's happened with COVID to an offensive mode and it's really allowing us to move forward and think about the investments we need to make for growth for our customers. So we have looked across all of compensation and starting with our benefits package and there were specific changes that we made to our benefits, as well as total rewards whether that was in benefit or also what happened from a short-term cash incentive to also long-term incentives as well. And so we have had a more comprehensive approach, really probably for our first time in quite some time across the entire organization from drivers to our maintenance technicians and our office employees. We are leaning in. We are on the offensive side of that, really preparing for growth inside all of our segments and in all of our support group. So it's something that we see happening here at the first of this year. We have been investing into our labor all of last year. But as Darren talked about our cost and us really trying to line out our price to what's happening in costs. We have tried to be offensive in that to make sure we have drivers, make sure we have our maintenance technicians and make sure that we have our office employees ready, equipped and available to help our customers. Chris, could take up one level just for our customers overall. I would say, demand is very strong across all of our services and so whether it's in container adds, 360box adds or adds in Dedicated or Final Mile, our customers are asking us to grow. We are really walking through either bid season or communication in those conversations in Dedicated and Final Mile to help us determine what we should do and then we want to have a balanced approach, making sure that we do what we say with our customers on our commitments and grow as much as possible with proper financial return. So bid season so far has gone well. We'll continue to get through bid season to help us refine what that can look like across all of our segments. So I would say throughout all of 2020 and 2021, when we would make a prediction typically we were wrong. And so, although, I would like to be optimistic, I think, this latest round of COVID has caught everyone by surprise. So I can't say that I feel optimistic about the supply chain challenges going away in the near-term. We are focused on making sure that we help our customers be right to help them smooth out their supply chain challenges and that we are there for them. I would say, any time there is more crisis in the supply chain, our moat agnostic solutions really come to the forefront, because we are fairly indifferent as to how we solve for our customers. We wrap around our customers, solve for us and then continue to move business. So for us we are going to be there for them. I can't really say if we are optimistic or not, because I am not certain what lies ahead, but we are planning for that, we are on the offensive side as I have said earlier on equipment, on people and on technology we think we can serve our customers that even more so this year, the last year. I feel like I have answered some of this before. I think we are in a great position for our customers. We did make the call early in 2021 to add more equipment to lean in and you are seeing that equipment now starting to come online. So I think we are in a great position with our customers, we are going to continue to be very close with them and make sure that we can answer whatever our customer's needs are. In 2021 more than any other year, I saw as be able to move freight from our customers. It wouldn't necessarily have moved in that mode or that type of shipment in the past. When a customer had a shipment, we could say, yes. J.B. Hunt 360 allowed for a lot of that, but also the interconnectivity of all of our segments, working very closely together, understanding where capacity was that and how we could help our customers. I don't see a lot of negative impacts for our organization if it were to say congested add is, we are already set up for the add is and we are continuing to talk closely with our customers. When you say that there is consensus that it's going to get a lot better, I am not sure how much that consensus is optimism versus reality and I think that that's really key questions that we are asking our customers. Certainly, we want to help our customers get better. We want to help them be more plan and help them reduce cost in their supply chain in total. But if nothing changes from today, we'll continue to lean into our customers, we'll continue to ask them, how we can help them more and we will make more bets on how we can help them through our people, technology and our equipment."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, my comments will recap the performance of our intermodal business in 2021 and specifically the fourth quarter. I will also provide an update on our significant investment to expand our capacity with our equipment orders and finish up with some thoughts about the outlook for the business in 2022 as we anticipate strong demand for our services as a result of our investments and the value of intermodal in the truck-to-rail conversion equation. I'd like to start by reviewing our recent performance, demand for our intermodal service remain strong in the fourth quarter, but similar to recent trends, was it reflected in the volume performance for the business as network congestion and restrictions hindered a large amount of our potential capacity. That said, I am proud of our team and its ability to onboard the equipment available to us to ensure that we met the commitments to our customers during their peak period of demand. On a positive note, we did see improvements in the quarter in parts of the network, specifically the speed in which customers were able to turn our equipment. However, those improvements were effectively offset by further deterioration in other parts of the network, namely rail velocity. For the quarter, box turns achieved minimal improvement from the third quarter. Needless to say lots of work remains to be done. As a result volumes for the quarter were down 3% year-over-year and by month volumes were down 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 1% in December. The onboarding of new equipment was slower than we anticipated, taking delivery of only 2,700 units in the quarter and approximately half of our 12,000 orders for the year. Naturally, this will push more units into our delivery plan for the first half of 2022. This investment in additional capacity and the corresponding investment in additional trucks and chassis, and most importantly, our people puts us in a good position to serve our customers and focus on growth in 2022. In addition to these investments, we continue to work closely with our customers and rail service providers to improve velocity in the system to unlock the latent capacity in the network. Predicting the exact timing of improvement in the network fluidity is difficult, particularly in light of some of the more recent disruption caused by new COVID cases impacting our own and our customer's operations. As we look forward to the year ahead and similar to what you have heard earlier, we are optimistic about our opportunities to grow the business. We have executed a plan that puts us on a solid growth trajectory based on items within our control. Consistent with our strategy historically, we will focus on striking the right balance between volume and price, while maintaining our financial discipline on targeting appropriate returns on our business. Of course, returns and margins are impacted by items like velocity and asset utilization, which will also be a key component in terms of how we manage the business as we progress through the year. In anticipation of questions on both volume and margin expectations for the year, my answer is, it depends, but know that the business will be managed to protect our investment and our returns on that investment. In closing, intermodal's value proposition remain strong supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight, as well as transloading freight into our domestic containers. We believe our service backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Well, my goodness, Scott, you managed multiple questions there and good morning to you Scott. I don't know where you are, but if its morning there, I don't want to be hanging with you. So, listen, yeah, we -- we are not satisfied with the flow of the new equipment in the fourth quarter. Certainly delays in the transportation of that equipment impacted us and that has pushed 6,000 into 2022. We are going to add capacity in 2022 beyond those. We are not prepared to release a number like that today. As it relates to accessorial and whatnot, I anticipated this question, of course, and really only one answer at one time today. We are not going to tell you how much was accessorial and how much was core pricing. We set out, I think every time I have been on an earnings call, I have talked about our focus on pricing to return profile. That continues to be the case. Certainly in 2021 we experienced some unusual characteristics and the equipment utilization was hampered, and we took action, and certainly, that had -- has -- is part of our results in the fourth quarter. But we also had meaningful cost to recover in the pricing cycle last year. 2020 saw really significant cost increases that we experienced and we were able to communicate that with customers and certainly recovered some of those costs. We certainly have additional pressure on driver wages, and we are constantly talking to both our customers and rail providers about the need for velocity improvements in our assets. So as we have always done, we will price for a return profile. There are probably times if utilization of our equipment is difficult, it may require a slightly higher margin, because utilization is hurt. But certainly as we can get benefits or better velocity on an equipment maybe the same margin requirement isn't there. We issued long-term margin guidance of 10% to 12%, and for the calendar year 2021, we hit an 89 order  and 11% margin. So we are right in the middle of our long-term guidance and I certainly would anticipate in 2022 we are able to continue growing, while also pricing in an effort to recover cost exposure that we have. Well, I mean, certainly, we did see some minor improvement in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. But minor, I mean, very, very minor effectively flat. And then we highlighted that rail velocity took a little bit of a step back in the fourth quarter, like you said, we would anticipate rail velocity to have some improvements. I know that all of our rail providers want nothing more than for velocity to improve. So I am confident that the efforts underway. As that takes hold, there is really significant capacity available in the market from Intermodal to move more loads. The good news is, demand remains extremely strong. We have customer business that we could have onboarded in the fourth quarter that we weren't able to because of a slowdown in velocity and capacity. So we remain really bullish on our opportunity to fill up that capacity in the combination of new containers coming onboard and a return to maybe pre-pandemic velocity statistics, we really feel strongly that we have a lot of demand. And we see that in other parts of our business, there is business operating inside the J.B. Hunt enterprise today then Intermodal is the correct solution for, but in 2021 truckload remained a solution, maybe it was a transit time requirement for that customer or a lack of capacity in the market from intermodal, but both of those factors play a role in a lot of confidence we have is the ability to grow as velocity improves. Okay. Well, the market is going to answer that question for us. We are certainly always out there competing. We are aware of prices that are winning business and we are aware of prices that are losing business in the competition. And so certainly if the market presents an opportunity for double-digit increases, I would tell you my experience always says that, without cost increases, it's not likely that double-digit rate increases present themselves without significant cost pressure. It would be -- I would consider a highly unusual for our rates to climb in the double-digit range without corresponding cost challenges coming out of the market. Those are going to dominate with driver wage predominantly, but certainly, the asset utilization is also playing a role. Oh! Capacity on BNSF. Let me just, we are aware of another channel that certainly left BNSF and went to Union Pacific, and certainly, that presents an opportunity, I mean, those lifts were occurring on BNSF, we are aligned with BNSF in a growth strategy, we have discussions with BNSF daily about our efforts to grow together and we have a lot of focus in that area in 2022. On the accessorial question, sorry, Ravi, we are just not going to answer that question. Man, Chris, that's the magic question, isn't it. So we have -- we certainly -- we have a meaningful percentage of those 6,000 that are literally on vessels either at anchor waiting to unload or in some form of transportation. I don't know that we have decided yet to break out how many. I think it's a fair assumption to just spread those 6,000 more or less evenly over the first half of the year. If we can move them in faster than that, we will. I am aware that I have given direction on this call for the last two calls of equipment count expectations and we haven't met either of those. So I don't want to give too much out there, but certainly we are trying to get all of that equipment here just as soon as we can. I think that with all of the talk of velocity challenges in 2021, we are going to be a little bit careful watching what comes from velocity improvements. I mean, there is really a lot of growth capacity in the system we have today plus the 6,000 boxes yet to be received, we can really grow a lot. We have a lot of confidence in our rail providers and our rail network and our ability to grow business there. In the event if velocity can't improve, then certainly we have to go buy more equipment in an effort to grow at the same pace, but that will come with sort of new challenges. So I don't have an answer for you on how many we would like to have. We would like to have as many as we can fill up to be honest and there's no great answer to that question, but certainly we have tremendous growth opportunities with our customers. We are confident in the demand equation out there and we know that if we can improve velocity, we can grow in a hurry and in the event that we can't improve velocity then we'll have to go secure more containers and grow that way."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We all thought 2020 was a remarkable year in our history, but I'll consider 2021 as a good contender for being equally challenging. And in the midst of perpetual challenge, we have continued to see our collective resiliency and strength periods during these unique times. Our teams have adjusted and adapted to multiple scenario changes impacting our customer's ability to thrive. In 2021, our leaders made bold calls to increase investments in our people, our technologies and expanding our fleets across our asset base. We have long been committed to following a disciplined approach for all capital allocations and believe these investments are good for our customers in the long-term. I can't say enough about the way every one of our team members has risen to the opportunities presented in this current environment. Accordingly, we have done exhausted research on where we stand regarding being competitive in total compensation for our people as we move into 2022. Our team leaders have unilaterally approved comprehensive changes to our base wages, incentive compensation, and benefits. Increasing our awareness for how we approach attracting and retaining the best talent is critical to our mission of creating the most efficient transportation network in North America. The overall growth we experienced in 2021 is unprecedented. Once again, revealing the necessity of our services and confirming the approach our people take on solving our customer's challenges. We added 1,778 tractors to DCS, 6,284 containers in the Intermodal with 531 net tractor adds and 3,605 trailers for our 360box program in highway. We continue to work strategically with our equipment providers on build and delivery plans as we head into 2022. With the growth coming out of 2021, we anticipate ongoing demand for all types of power and trailer equipment. We also look forward to working with our rail service providers to find improvements across all aspects of intermodal service, capacity management and utilization. Lastly, I'll comment on our efforts relating to sustainability. Over the past several years, we have worked to better understand, communicate and advance our positioning in this important area. While we have seen good progress and have been recognized by many third parties for our efforts, we also believe we have important work to do. We are committed to our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America and we are also committed to being transparent on the progress of our sustainability journey. This concludes my remarks. Our executives will provide more specific information, so I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. And Amit, what was the second part of your question, I am sorry. Do we address both of them... And then, Ken, on part two there, the technology enhancements, it's really on the tail of the investment that we have been making. And what I am referencing there is that we will be deploying some internal tools that will allow and should allow for our peoples productivity to be improved, which we would expect will allow us to advance our strategy as we move forward. And so, I am just really excited about finally getting done with some of those tools that we are going to be able to utilize to make better decisions, to make decisions faster and to enhance overall productivity of our workforce. And then, as we have stated, we are not interested in giving guidance around return -- our return expectations are for the year. I think that we are early in bid season. We are going to need to see what the market does and how it continues to respond to the work that we have been doing. If you look back over the last several years going back to 2018, I am at least encouraged that we have returns closely to a profitability level we saw before the heavy lift tech investments, but we are not inside of our desired long-term range yet at this point. So we are working every day. The technology that I just referenced is hopeful to aid us in that and we would anticipate and expect to continue on our journey towards the 4%, 6% range that we stated previously. Thank you. And I'd like to first say, I appreciate a much more balanced discussion here today. Though we still have work to do, I kept a little score here on the questions that were asked for our different leaders and I am encouraged and we'll continue in that vein. I would say the two big takeaways are that the businesses are all lined up, well positioned, look to grow, look to continue the momentum that we have. And then, collectively, because of that individual strength we have a compounded strength that, I like the question, what if does it does it get better? And when Shelley was answering that question, I was thinking to myself, okay, so that means we keep doing what we are doing here. We have learned how to do that. But if you look at the strength that we are demonstrating through this pandemic, through this supply chain disruption, with really a fairly simple focus on invest for customers, serve customers, generate the right amount of return and then invest for our customers again. We don't really have a predisposition to one element or another as we continue to move down this road of being agnostic. We just want to answer that question. And I think our momentum with the customer base is continuing to gain strength that they are appreciate that we will invest for them in equipment, they appreciate that we will pivot away from an equipment investment, it's a better answer presents itself. So closing out the year we were thrilled with the year, we were thrilled to get to pay our people a special bonus. And I'd just close by saying that people focus is really where it's at for us. I have never seen the kind of exhaustive work that we have done this year to understand our position and balance that against risks of not taking action versus taking action and then thinking about how we need to make those investments return for us, the same way we think about our assets. But we have great tech, we have great assets and equipment, but our people are the difference. They -- and I know that's a little bit cliche to some of us, but I am telling you that when it gets down to push and shove, our folks are going to be there, they are going to get the job done. What will this year bring, we'll see. We thank you for your call and your attention today."

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The third quarter continued to present the momentum we spoke of during our last earnings call. We also see persistent irregularities in demand patterns substantially resulting from port, labor and inventory challenges with our customers. The congestion at key inbound port locations has further challenged the desired smoothing of supply chains in preparation for the upcoming holiday season. We find that the dialogue with our key customers reveals both a challenged labor market and a pent-up need to increase the in-stock levels across the system. Planned additions to our container and trailing fleets and the expansion in contract services, both Final Mile and Dedicated should all contribute positively as these headwinds abate. The company is not insulated from the labor dynamics mentioned above for our customers. This year, we have reached all-time highs in the need for company drivers in all segments as well as openings we have on our office and field teams. We have done comprehensive and exhaustive research on our current compensation and benefits programs along with our incentive plans to help better position our jobs going forward. Progress in closing the gaps for both driver and non-driver positions, has been made during the quarter and we are optimistic these gaps will continue to shrink for us. As our executives will discuss today, we are generally pleased with the performance of all segments. However, we do have ample room for improvement with the inventory flows and contractor model in our Final Mile business as well as in the utilization of equipment in intermodal. Even with these opportunities, we see our supply chain focused service is well-positioned and healthy for the long-term needs of our customers. We are also encouraged by the continued progress we see in the utilization of our 360 platforms and the productivity gains resulting from expanded usage across the company with our carriers and with our shippers. The past few weeks have returned us to the annual tradition of honoring our multimillion mile drivers, who over many years accomplished the pinnacle of our profession. In Lowell, we have posted two sessions for a total of over 100 drivers reaching between 2 million and 5 million safe miles along with their families for a 2-day celebration with our entire corporate team. We have been extremely careful to host these sessions following CDC guidelines. Nevertheless, we have done all of us a world of good to see our very best in person again. The energy has been contagious and I assure that it will carry us forward nicely. Please check out our website to see how we recognize these incredible men and women. I will now turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his comments. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Staying consistent with recent quarters, I will start by providing a couple of comments on our third quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Overall, we are pleased with our revenue growth over the prior year, which was up 27% and the result of improvements in all segments. Our operating income increased 56% with mixed results from some segments that are the result of cost pressures from labor issues, but also due to the significant growth in implementing new contractual businesses that will be addressed in the segment discussions. Interest expense was consistent with prior year and we had a slight increase in our tax rate resulting in earnings per share of $1.88 for the quarter, which is an increase of nearly 60% over the prior year. The impacts of labor shortages, network congestion and just general supply chain challenges are well-known and they persisted in the quarter, again, straining our ability to service the demand and effectively utilize our assets, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Additional cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs and other employee costs of incentive compensation and medical benefits. We ended the quarter with approximately $530 million in cash. At the beginning of the year, we had announced a heavy investment in equipment for 2021. While all orders remain in place, the constraints noted have limited our ability to in-service this equipment. Through unconventional means, including leasing our own private vessels, we are able to add just shy of 3,000 JBI containers and over 900 JBT trailers during the quarter as well as having success in sourcing our tractor needs as a result of solid relationships with our equipment manufacturers. Considering these constraints, we are adjusting our expected CapEx spend for the remainder of 2021 and now expect our CapEx to approximate a little over $1 billion for the full year. We remain committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers and continue our focus on obtaining the equipment order. While we haven\u2019t finalized plans for 2022 yet, our initial expectations are for CapEx to exceed 2021 levels, but will depend largely on the ability and timing to obtaining the equipment. We purchased $50 million of our shares in the third quarter, bringing us to $135 million for the year and anticipate continuing buybacks on a more regular basis. We will continue to balance our cash outlay on equipment, dividends, and buybacks for the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, trending towards our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis. In recent quarters, we have updated you on costs directly related to COVID, which have principally been in the form of special bonuses for frontline employees and PTO for employees needing to quarantine. While we still incur these costs, we have now lapped quarters of providing this, and as such, there are no meaningful reconciliations to the prior year quarter. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID focusing on the health and safety of our people while staying informed of state and federal mandates around vaccinations and other protocols. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John and good morning. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our updated thoughts around peak season and our preliminary planning for 2022. I will also give some updated thoughts on the progress we are making inside our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. We continue to see plenty of opportunities in the market to provide valuable services for customers meeting comprehensive supply chain solutions. While fluidity across the supply chain remains challenging, we are working closely with our customers to develop and execute plans that get their freight delivered. We believe our ability to source capacity on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform continues to differentiate us and our go-to-market strategy and ensure customers find the most efficient way to move their freight. Capacity remains tight across all channels as evidenced by elevated spot and contract rates across all modes of transportation. Further adding to fluidity challenges is the backlog of freight off the West Coast waiting to get unloaded at the ports. We share in these frustrations and are not immune to these impacts as some of our containers are also sitting out in the Pacific waiting to be unloaded. While peak season is upon us, we believe the bottlenecks in the West Coast are going to compact and even intensify further peak season capacity needs into November and December and are preparing ourselves accordingly. As we think about planning for 2022, we will turn our attention to leveraging our people, technology and equipment to not only optimize our customers\u2019 freight, but even more important, optimize their freight spend. Freight is moving inefficiently today at elevated truck and spot rates, which will be ripe for conversion to intermodal when we also have the full onboarding of our 12,000 new intermodal containers. While we remain focused on executing our peak season plans, we are also focused on positioning our customers to deliver on their budget for 2022 with the most efficient and cost effective solution available. And again, we stand ready to meet the needs of our customers as we enter the new year. We continue to be extremely encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. Carrier and shipper user activity and engagement metrics continue to accelerate, providing further evidence in the value of being able to optimize and transact in real time and a more frictionless process. With regards to automation, we have completed the pilot of some of our automated tools for matching freight between shippers and carriers and have begun as thoughtfully paste rollout of the system to our personnel in the field. We expect to see additional productivity and service quality benefits over the next year as the system is fully rolled out and utilized. As we move forward, we remain focused on improving access, visibility and transparency on our platform, which we believe sets us up to achieve your mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. Closing out my comments and similar to a message I shared with you last quarter, I remain extremely encouraged about our position to leverage our people, access and technology to help our customers through their supply chain challenges. Those attributes combined with our experience, tenured workforce and broad and expanding scroll of services is what I believe differentiates us in the market and why I believe customers continue to lean into us during these challenging times. That concludes my comments. And I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley and good morning. I will focus my comments on the performance of both our Dedicated Contract Service business, or DCS and the Final Mile Service businesses, FMS. I will also provide you an update from a general operational perspective on both the driver market as well as our ability to source equipment. In our Dedicated business, we continue to see tremendous demand for our professionally outsourced fleet solutions. Propelled by the current market dynamics around driver and equipment availability, our backlog and pipeline remains strong. I am extremely proud of the team\u2019s ability to execute this quarter, highlighted by the addition of 744 trucks in the quarter. This is the largest number of truck adds in any single quarter. As historically is the case, startup costs did put pressure on margins in the quarter as we incurred costs before we begin to recognize revenue. But let me be clear, we are extremely pleased with these results as it sets the stage for solid growth and momentum as we roll forward. The new business we have been onboarding represents a broad and diverse mix of customer accounts across both industry verticals and geographies. While we in the industry are facing driver recruitment challenges, customers in most instances have been willing to support our out-of-cycle adjustments to support higher wages for our professional driving workforce. As I alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong demand for our service. And as an update, we have sold 1,899 trucks year-to-date as of September 30 on incremental of 734 trucks from our last update on our second quarter call. Now, transitioning to our Final Mile Services update, we see solid growth opportunities in this market that is and will be supported by our ability to differentiate our service product. As a result, we continue to make investments in our people and processes to support our growth outlook. Relative to some of our recent quarters, profitability was pressured as a result of several factors. Similar to Dedicated, we priced startup costs for the quarter, given the smaller base of business that had a disproportionate impact on our results. Additionally, our contract carriers are also facing labor challenges, particularly for the second seat in the delivery trucks in addition to those at our customer warehouses. Finally and as we discussed last quarter, supply chain issues are impacting product availability, and in turn, our ability to leverage our network to deliver goods potentially in the appliance and furniture categories. We believe these challenges are mostly transitory. Going forward, we are encouraged by the new business we are onboarding and we are on pace for a record new year of sales. We continue to see a solid pipeline of both growth opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the future. Our success will be largely dependent on our ability to differentiate the service experience for our customers\u2019 customer and we remain committed to making the needed investments to achieve that differentiation. Finally, to close on some general operational updates, we have been extremely focused on our hiring efforts in the field to support our growth. As we have discussed in past quarters, we believe J.B. Hunt offers one of the most attractive driving opportunities given the concentration of work in both local and regional applications, combined with top pay and career advancement opportunities. This is also true for our field managers and operations personnel. We have continued to make adjustments to wages and benefits to make our company even more attractive to those seeking a rewarding employment opportunity. Additionally, we have been working closely with our equipment providers in order to support our growth. We have had to hold trades of some of our equipment to support our pipeline, but continue to stay attentive to both maintenance cost and fuel economy as a result. That concludes my remarks. So I will turn it over to Brad.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Nick and good morning. I will focus my comments on the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and Trucks. I\u2019d like to start off by recognizing all members of our ICS and JBT segments for how they continue to respond in the current environment to elevated demand trends. Our customers continue to present us with opportunities to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions and the team continues to respond very well in these demanding times. The experience of our people, leveraging our technology platform and our physical assets continues to provide us opportunities to source and provide capacity for customers in what continues to be an extremely capacity constrained environment. The ability to source that capacity is enabled by our technology investments into our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and is complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. We continue to invest in these areas as well as in our people to provide more solutions from our customers. I will start with my comments on truck or JBT. Revenue grew 87% year-over-year to $204 million. This is the first quarter that JBT segment has generated over $200 million of revenue since 2007 and we were able to accomplish this with approximately 60% fewer trucks versus that period. This is yet another example of our organization\u2019s focus on providing value-added solutions for customers while maintaining our focus on scaling into large addressable markets with our desire for adequate returns on our capital. We believe our drop trailer capacity or 360box is the power-only capacity sourced through our platform provides us an opportunity for sustainable growth. Our trailing capacity increased 20% versus the prior year and 11% from the end of the second quarter and the segment generated $14.7 million of operating income, the highest of any third quarter since 2006. Going forward, we will continue to stay disciplined on our desire to grow, while also focusing on driving greater network efficiencies, particularly in our drop trailer network. Shifting gears to Integrated Capacity Solutions or our ICS segment, ICS delivered $666 million of revenue, breaking our prior quarterly record achieved just last quarter. Revenue grew 55% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 4% in the quarter, while specifically truckload volume growth was 14% year-over-year. The cost of sourcing third-party capacity remains elevated, which is a continuation of the same trends we have seen through the latter parts of 2020 and all of 2021. That said, gross margins did expand 150 basis points sequentially as a result of further scaling of our platform, implementation of higher contractual rates and robust spot opportunities. We believe the market dynamics could tighten even further in the fourth quarter as congestion across the supply chain is likely to compress, the timing of peak season, and intensified customer needs for capacity solutions right up to the holidays. Going forward, we will continue to invest to expand the capabilities and functions of our multimodal digital freight platform for our carriers and customers as well as for our people to drive greater productivity and efficiencies and sourcing cost effective solutions for our customers while giving carriers great visibility to the freight on our platform. In closing, we continue to see solid momentum across our JBT and ICS segments as evidenced by both segments delivering the strongest top line growth across our scroll of services for the fourth consecutive quarter in a row, while much work has been done, there is still much to accomplish, but along the way, we will remain committed to our investments and our people and our technology platform that will drive waste out of the system and help us deliver on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. This concludes my comments. I will pass it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Brad and good morning. I am going to focus my comments on three items related to our intermodal business. First, I am going to review performance in the quarter. I will also discuss network fluidity and our continuous effort to improve velocity and capacity for our customers. And finally, I will discuss continued investment in both people and the onboarding of our trailing capacity that we think is going to put us in a solid position to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing for our services and to further support and accelerate the truck to rail conversion opportunities. While demand for our intermodal services remains very strong, our volume performance in the quarter doesn\u2019t reflect that as fluidity challenges across our network continued to temper available capacity to serve that demand. As we discussed last quarter, we believe the core challenges around network fluidity for both our rail providers and customers center around the availability of labor and has continued to provide challenges across the entire supply chain. Volumes for the quarter were down 6% and by month, volumes were down 7% in July, down 6% in August, and down 5% in September. Improvements in rail network fluidity, particularly at the terminals and quicker turns of our equipment at customer locations, combined with the onboarding of the new containers would and will help us provide additional capacity. As we discussed last quarter, we implemented programs with our customers to encourage better utilization of our equipment, while protecting our need to generate appropriate returns on our significant investment in both people and equipment to support additional capacity. Importantly, these programs are designed to provide the benefit of additional capacity that results from gained efficiencies. I would say that the results from this program thus far have been mixed. We have some customer locations improve, while other locations have deteriorated even in instances within the same customers\u2019 footprint. I would also say, from our perspective, the results of the program have been mixed based simply on the fact that we would absolutely prefer to move more volume and provide more capacity for customers, which was not the case in the quarter. I believe this highlights the severity of the labor challenges across the supply chain. Box turns in the quarter fell sequentially to 1.62 versus 1.65 in the prior quarter, further supporting that view. We continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in our intermodal business. Customer demand continues to grow and our rail providers continue to view us as a solution to the current congestion challenges that are even more severe in the international intermodal market. Owning our own equipment, including power, trailing and chassis and our highly skilled driver and operations personnel are differentiated in the market particularly around fluidity and service. This is further supported by our J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity when rail congestion or restrictions hamper our ability to serve. In closing, Intermodal\u2019s value proposition remains strong as driver and labor challenges continue to plague the supply chain combined with higher energy prices and the fact that an intermodal shipment on average is 60% less carbon intensive than the all-truck alternative. We will continue to make investments to support the meaningful growth opportunities in the market. We expect to take delivery of our entire 12,000 container order by early 2022, setting us up to provide meaningful savings for our customers as we begin the next bid cycle. That concludes my prepared comments.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Darren, if I can just start with you on the fluidity question and what that means for volumes going forward. If we layer that on top of the high-profile announcement made this week, from the administration and the port ship 24/7 operations conceivably. How do you think that, that plays into your volumes? And quite frankly, the fluidity of the system in the year end and do you think you and your partners have the capacity if the gates are open longer to handle more volumes? And finally, can you do that profitably? I don\u2019t know if that translates into overtime costs? Like how does that figure into the profitability of the business if you\u2019re kind of running 24/7?\nDarren Field: Well, Jon, great question. We are \u2013 continue to be confident that as our customers have growing demand in Southern California, that we have capacity to continue growing with those customers, but we are asking the customers to help us in that area to help us unload faster and create a more fluid capacity solution for us. We\u2019re also onboarding additional equipment during the fourth quarter, which will certainly help. But we would anticipate that we will continue to offer additional capacity for our customers as the customers participate in that solution. So that\u2019s the key element of this, while getting equipment out of the port is going to drive new demand. But at the same time, the customers have to be able to receive it. And we\u2019re working with them. We\u2019re supporting them in that area, and that\u2019s really, really important for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Darren, maybe another one for you, just wanted to think about that revenue per load in the intermodal side, obviously, a very, very strong performance, is there any way you can kind of break down what is kind of core base rate relative to what might be sort of accessorial fees that have the potential to go hold that fluidity comes back to the network and we start to see volume and utilization pickup. I just want to get a sense of maybe what sort of the sustainable underlying rate environment that you\u2019re building now off of going forward the next several quarters?\nDarren Field: Yes. We anticipated this. And unfortunately, we\u2019re not going to be able to break that down in any way. I just want to probably remind the entire growth list, and we\u2019re not going to break out any sort of accessorial commentary. I think that core pricing was strong going into the third quarter and while costs were also up, and we will always anticipate that our core pricing is maintaining coverage for the cost exposure that we have. We\u2019re paying drivers more today. We\u2019re hiring outsourced carriers at higher rates today. Our equipment utilization is down. That\u2019s driving some of the pricing out there. And certainly, our rail providers also participate in our cost base. So those are all factors that drive core pricing, and we really probably don\u2019t have any other commentary on that at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just before I get to my question, Darren, just a follow-up there, like is it fair though that core pricing would have accelerated from whatever we saw in the second quarter?\nDarren Field: Yes. It\u2019s fair to assume.\nScott Group: Okay. So I guess, how are you thinking about contractual pricing for next year in light of trucking companies talking about at least mid-single-digit pricing. And then just given the environment, can you maybe talk about your plans to grow the container count beyond just the 12,000 that you\u2019re taking this year, early next year?\nJohn Roberts: Okay. I think that as we go into next year on the pricing environment, we\u2019re probably way early to offer any kind of commentary compared to some of the other we\u2019re surprised that anybody would come out and say anything about that at this point. There is just too much unknown today. I mean we\u2019ve never been in an environment like this and the cost environment is going to drive pricing for us. That\u2019s always going to drive our pricing decisions as we\u2019re focused on the returns of the investments we put into place. Certainly, the container order for 12,000 that we announced earlier this year, we continue to onboard that equipment as fast as we can get it here. Decisions about advancing the equipment next year will continue as we finalize plans for next year. And frankly, as we continue to work with customers and see what\u2019s happening in the market relative to demand velocity improvements that are really available to our customer base to achieve savings not only in what their intermodal experience today, but converting more business off the highway at better pricing compared to truckload can really produce an awful lot of capacity if we can just improve the velocity of the current fleet. All that being said, if we see an opportunity to expand our equipment and the customers are supporting that with pricing, then I have no doubt our organization will set a path to do that, but we have a long way to go before a decision is made on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I\u2019ll stick with the intermodal theme. Darren, last quarter, you gave some helpful commentary on the cadence of the intermodal container deliveries. Any update on that front you could share in terms of the number of containers you\u2019re expecting to receive in the fourth quarter and then in the first. And then also, would love to get your thoughts sequential progression of box turns the next couple of quarters? Does taking these additional containers make it tougher to see some improvement there?\nJohn Roberts: Okay. We had said that we expected to get 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3, and I think we highlighted in prepared comments that we were just under 3,000 while we had equipment anchored waiting to unload literally just weeks ago that would have certainly hit on that mark. At this point, I\u2019d say we would end the year somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 of the boxes onboarded. So we feel like there is an improved cadence in the fourth quarter coming with new boxes onboarding. But we\u2019re not immune to the challenges. The port of Los Angeles and onboarding that equipment, that certainly has influenced our ability to get that equipment here, and we will continue to work through it. We feel really good about how we approach that this year, and we will continue to work to that end, but 8,000 to 9,000 by the end of the year, so I\u2019ll let you do the math on the fourth quarter. As far as box turn sequential cadence, that\u2019s a great question and that we\u2019re focusing with our customers every single day on how to improve that number related to their actions that are influencing it. And they are not the only influencer. Certainly, our rail providers are moving somewhat slower than we would have anticipated. So at this point, I would have said at the end of Q2 that I can\u2019t imagine it getting worse. And you know what, it did. So I\u2019m going to be cautious to give you any kind of thoughts on that moving forward. I just want to highlight that we\u2019re working every single day to improve that number. And that won\u2019t end any time we\u2019re chasing two turns a month and really anticipate a lot of conversation with our customers on this over the coming months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, Darren, I had a question I guess, on intermodal volume growth just beyond the cycle and beyond what we are seeing in trucking rates and fuel prices and it\u2019s really have to do it kind of a higher level of transloading. I am not sure if this is a real opportunity for J.B. Hunt, but it just seems like the international liner companies are probably, I would imagine, less willing to move their international boxes inland from the ports. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any of that and if there is a real opportunity for pent-up demand release on the transloading side next year that could drive maybe some bigger volume of improvement.\nDarren Field: Sure. All good thoughts, I think Shelley and I will both comment on this question. For a long time, our target for growth in intermodal has been highway conversion first. But certainly, we have felt that domestic intermodal in a 53-foot container was a benefit to shippers importing through Southern California and the flows of the international equipment and the massive amounts of empties that that flow to various ports in order to get back to Asia, certainly does represent an opportunity. I think that as the international congestion at various rail terminals throughout the interior of the country have driven a lot of conversations with customers that are looking for that solution. We have grown with transload for many, many years now and would anticipate that, that is a primary focus for our growth in the coming years and absolutely plan to capitalize on that. I don\u2019t know, Shelley, you may have a comment.\nShelley Simpson: Yes. So we look at our ability to grow intermodal in two areas. So transloading for sure would be an opportunity. If you think about the advantages we can give at the railroads and our customers really is around our operations so because we control really the three critical components: the chassis, the driver and the container. Our ability to create a very fluid network at the destination is very different than what happens today from an international perspective. And when railroads are constrained that allows us to think about and process differently there. The second one is in over-the-road conversions to which I did talk about that in my opening remarks, but we do see a high percentage of shipments that are moving on rail today, part of that our intentional strategy to own any lane that moves intermodal in our highway space. And so we\u2019re gaining access and information through our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform, to be able to know what we can and should talk to our customers about converting. So that\u2019s going to be a big focus for us as we come through the rest of this fourth quarter, very focused on peak and helping our customers be successful. We also are working closely with them to determine the price that\u2019s moving on the highway today that we know to move into intermodal. So I would tell you, those 12,000 boxes I have high confidence in being able to load those at good quality of revenue. And I think, to the earlier question around what we would add would really be dependent on what our customers can do from a fluidity perspective on turning in equipment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to turn to Dedicated and FMS has the same issue. Is there a way to quantify the negative impact from the new business adds versus the cost inflation? And then I guess as we\u2019re looking at Q4 and your backlog comments, should we assume that stays elevated? Or does it start to intensify here? Just any color that would be helpful?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. I would just say that when we look at what we call our core business, we see the operating margin being very acceptable within our range, clearly, with our \u2013 in our range of guidance. So we break that out internally and look at that. So it is operating very well. And then our start-ups are looking very good. We measure those as they are coming out of startup getting to certain hurdle rates. So we\u2019re very pleased with the pricing and how that\u2019s performing. And then from the backlog I would just say, yes, the backlog is probably a little more than it has been historically. So the demand is still there. There is still a lot of demand for our services and our pipeline is very, very full on the Dedicated and on the Final Mile side. And then on the Final Mile side, it\u2019s got a smaller base. And so the start-ups are really dramatically impacting that. Because contractor rates are up and we\u2019re just seeing a lot of warehouse labor rates up as well. So we\u2019re getting a lot of costs in there. So we\u2019ve got some supply chain issues, some labor costs that we\u2019re addressing. But the demand is still there for our services as well. But the number one impact on Final Mile, I would say, is our startups.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning everyone. If I can just follow-up on that last comment, kind of how do we think about that going into 4Q? I mean you had high-quality problems, the launch costs in Dedicated for a while now. We do recognize that this is a high-quality problem. But kind of how do we think about that going into the 4Q? And also maybe for Shelley, on the ICS side, what\u2019s the update on the Google partnership that you guys had? I think there was a product or launch suppose your drop before the end of the year, is that still on track and how do we think about that scaling into next year? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: That\u2019s a good way to get two questions in there in one breath, I guess. On the dedicated side, I would just say that with our demand still pent up, we\u2019re going to continue to feel pressure with the startups just before our supply is own start-ups, and we\u2019re going to continue to see that moving forward for a while.\nShelley Simpson: And I would say on our Google Strategic Alliance, we are on track and feel confident about of the two big projects that we\u2019ve been working on our first one is further along. And then the second one, but that\u2019s really still timing-wise in good shape. We do have a bigger idea that we have brought to the discussion, and that is a huge focus of what the team is looking into. We\u2019re not ready to say whether that would be a 2022 release yet on top of the first two projects, but we do have a more aspirational idea that we\u2019re working on in that co-innovation segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, morning. Just had a nice step up in the intermodal margin in the quarter, I heard your comments around bottlenecks, maybe intensifying in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re thinking about 2022 in terms of timing of supply chain congestion leasing. But putting all that together, the 11.7% kind of a number we can benchmark offer? Or is it difficult to assess given the supply channel situation?\nDarren Field: Well, I think we\u2019ve talked about our long-term margin targets of 10 to 12 back at the first quarter call in April, and beyond that commentary, I don\u2019t think we can really highlight anything else. Our mission right now is to achieve growth and achieve return on the investment of our equipment, and those are the factors that drive our decisions in intermodal.\nJordan Alliger: Just following though what about on any \u2013 the high level costs around the supply chain situation going into next year, I mean, do you expect an alleviation then?\nDarren Field: I think that we are all commonsense people and realize that there will come a time in the congestion eases. We are going to stop very short of predicting when that will happen because like you, we have no idea. But if somebody told me in the second half of \u201822, things will loosen up a bit. I\u2019m not going to be surprised. But at the same time, we\u2019re going to have to wait and see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. 18 months into this surge in supply chain disruption, when you sit down with your customers, what is your sense for how things are changing in permanent or city permanent in nature from how they procure freight and want to manage their supply chain? And what decisions are you making at the senior management and board level to capitalize on that not just next year, but 2, 3, 4 years down the road? Thanks.\nShelley Simpson: I will try to take that if anybody has anything to add. I think our customers are hopeful that this is not a permanent or long-term position from how the supply chain is operating today. There is too much uncertainty, which is driving too much cost in unplanned events whether that is unplanned on the shipping side, where it should be shipping from or even where it\u2019s going to. So, I think there is a good hope that we can create more efficiency. That\u2019s something that we are working on with our customers. The last thing we want to do is be inflationary in total without looking first to say what can we do to help our customers meet their budgets overall. I would tell you customers in general. The theme Accelerate was something with so we rolled out in our Sales Summit, February 2020. It could not have been a better theme as we moved into COVID, and we have continued to see our customers accelerate on solutions, idea sets, I think they are leaning more into providers that can do a multitude of different deliveries for them across the supply chain. Certainly, we are seeing that, we are seeing market share gains across all five of our segments. And our customers are asking us to consider and do things we have not done before. And so we are being open to solving for best answers for them. We are agnostic as to how we move a shipment so that helps to create a differentiation in the market for us, but they need a lot of help. They are constrained on labor, not just as for our DC locations, but also just in their office personnel. And so we are leading into our technology, our engineering teams, I would say, across the board. Have a lot of confidence that we are going to be able to continue to take more market share and help our customers be right when it comes to having an efficient supply chain.\nNick Hobbs: I would just add that what \u2013 we are seeing really is the customers trying to take control of everything they can, which leans into us, as Shelley said. So, they are getting ships. They are leasing their own ships. They are wanting us to go into ports for them to help them control the experience in there, then the  on the intermodal side with transload and then they are helping us on the Dedicated side with more fleet. So, it\u2019s really about customers gaining control of their supply chain and that fits very well with us.\nBrad Hicks: The last thing I would say, this is Brad Hicks, is that recognizing the stress constrain and disruption that puts a lot of pressure on our customers supply chain teams and it plans its way into our group. And we remain remarkably proud of how our talented employees have helped navigate those choppy waters. And so there is a lot of just pressure and stress, and our team has found a way to thrive in that environment on behalf of our customers.\nJohn Roberts: Let me just \u2013 this is John Roberts finish the thought with the question on the Board, which is we are return on invested capital business. And all of these needs and demands will hit the filter if we do this do we achieve the kind of returns that we are used to and expect and that our owners and our customers frankly expect because we reinvest. But that visibility, we have to performance P&Ls, returns on those investments is vital to that last step of getting the approval to make the investments to continue to grow the business as we have.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the man of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. So, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on labor markets. I mean it seems like you talked about labor, labor, labor being the constraint. I am thinking about intermodal in particular. And I just wonder if you could comment about some of the particular labor elements, whether it\u2019s warehouse, rail, intermodal terminals, your own drayage. Are you optimistic that if you look out a couple of quarters that labor availability will increase? And if so, what \u2013 is that just a function of paying people more? And then I guess a related component, how do you think about vaccine mandates? And if you think that goes into effect, what does that do to kind of a broader impact on the labor side? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Okay. Let me take that first, and then we will have Nick comment on and some thoughts around driver availability and vaccine mandates as well and other labor thoughts. So, I think our rail providers and the transportation system that we are running, we are recruiting truck drivers at \u2013 in intermodal in addition to the rest of the organization at an extremely rapid pace and it\u2019s difficult. I don\u2019t want that to come \u2013 it\u2019s never been more difficult than it is today to find and attract and retain qualified drivers. It\u2019s very, very challenging. And certainly the costs are we are facing that. I believe our rail providers are not immune to it and their contract workers inside the terminals, continues to be a challenge for the rail providers. But I think they have actions in place to counter that. And certainly, at the end of the day, that simply means we all have to compete for that labor. The thing that has been the most difficult for us to get eyes on is customer warehouse labor, and that\u2019s where there is a significant bottleneck is our customers\u2019 ability to unload the demand that they have. And so when you ask the question about what do we see a future in which that changes. I don\u2019t know that we have a line of sight to any kind of real dramatic improvements in it. But what we have line of sight to is our customers have to process their supply chains more efficiently to achieve their goals and that seems logical to us that they will attack this labor situation. Nick, you may have some more?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. I would just say on the labor situation, it\u2019s across the board, its maintenance tax, it\u2019s drivers. There is going to be tremendous pressure on wages. I see that continuing on for quite some time, all throughout the supply chain. More on the Biden or the vaccine mandate or testing, we will be compliant with that. And we are working with the third-parties so that we \u2013 if it becomes an order and gets through OSHA, then we will be compliant with it. It will be a lot of bureaucracy. I don\u2019t see it really helping the situation much other than causing confusion in the supply chain even more. But we will be compliant with that and follow that process. So, it will have some impact on the industry, but we will make it through.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. John and team congrats on the great results in the tough operating quarter. Just to clarify on the last statement there. So, if you are not seeing any shift or benefit as we move past peak in the supply chain, right? It\u2019s not like the increased wages so far have increased. But then I guess to give Darren a quick break, Shelley, Brad or Nick, from your perspective across the supply chain, is there any thoughts on underlying demand or shift from what you see aside from peak outside of congestion, obviously, we saw some of the volumes down on intermodal. Any thoughts just on underlying demand would be great? Thanks.\nShelley Simpson: Ken thank you for those comments. I think all of us know if you go to the shelf today, at a store. Many of those are empty, and we are hearing that directly from our customers as they are somewhat surprised as to what\u2019s happening in peak and as well is pushing peak longer into November and December. And that will make for more replenishment in the first quarter and even into the second quarter of next year. So, we do believe that the first quarter will be unusually stronger than it has been in maybe a more typical environment really trying to get their shelves and inventory in the right places in the same time. So, demand from that perspective is still there. In total, don\u2019t have great comments about the second half of the year because people are asking us and customers are really trying to do that through their budget process right now. But I would say strong demand, optimistic, feel really good. And then last comment, I have been asking retailers, if they feel like because this Christmas season, the right products won\u2019t be on the shelves will gift cards be more here in this Christmas season. And I think that we are leaning to a yes, which means there would be more shopping and more retail sales in January and obviously, more need for us to replenish, any of those goods as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. So Brad, I wanted to ask on the step-up in profitability in ICS. I know that the second half of this year, there has kind of been a marker out that, that was when we could hit the inflection point. But I also know there has been a lot of cross currents kind of in the brokerage market. So, can you talk a little bit about the improvement in profitability? And also as we look to 2022, is that a year where ICS can be in the targeted margin range of 4% to 6%?\nBrad Hicks: Yes. Thanks, Todd. We continue to progress on our strategy and the investments that we have made in our people and our technology that will allow us to scale. And I think as you look back over really the last several quarters, we have continued on that trend, and we remain supportive and optimistic as we continue to move forward into Q4. Obviously, there are a tremendous amount of unknowns that have been discussed at length this morning in all segments of our company as well as with our customers. But the solutions that we are able to provide for our customers in the time of need, they are leaning in and we are being very successful by being able to put them in the most efficient answer, whether that\u2019s our highway products on J.B. Hunt 360box, whether that\u2019s intermodal or even in ICS. And so I guess said a different way, we remain very pleased with the progress and really see no reason that we won\u2019t continue to take steps forward to create leverage as we scale the platform.\nShelley Simpson: I might try to add to that. Scale is so important in the platform. We did start on the Carrier 360 side first and then we further launched with Shipper 360. We do believe that we have a good percentage of carriers that are coming into our platform looking at our shelves, if you will, and looking for products. And we have a lot of empty shelves also because you don\u2019t have enough freight. And so we are very focused on making sure that our platform is the destination location for carriers to be able to come in, search for what they want and get the product that they need at the right time. We have high confidence in the amount of time that we have actually been with carriers and the different measurements that we are seeing continuing to break records even in this very constrained environment. We are in a new mode with carriers. So, that\u2019s allowing us to go back into the demand side to customers in a different way, but scaling is the most important component for us in getting not only revenue growth for our business, but primarily for our bottom line profitability as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Shelley and Brad, maybe a follow-up on that last train of thought. When you look at the last three quarters, ICS has had more spot than contract volume that sort of shifted back this quarter. So, can you elaborate on how you are thinking about balancing that mix when things are so volatile against maybe the opportunity to continue taking more share? And then you can just touch on the expectations for productivity in 360, you mentioned there is continued efforts in automation, is this more of a productivity play, or do you think this will help really grow the top line which at least in 360 look like there was a bit flat quarter-over-quarter in this period? Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Yes. Brian, I will start. If I take you back momentarily, we have a strategy going into Q1 that we were maintaining the cost levels that we saw at the end of 2020. And really we didn\u2019t win. And we talked about that in our Q1 release. And then we started to see come customers come back to us. And we started to grow into the bid season through Q2 and Q3. And so we would anticipate wanting to continue to move forward and be successful from a published standpoint and get maybe a little bit more balanced from a historical perspective. Obviously, bid season just kicked off for this year, about 1.5 weeks ago. And so we will see where that fits, but it\u2019s certainly our expectation to continue to grow in published freight to create balance against the spot opportunities. Some of that really goes back to the disruption that Shelley spoke of earlier in the call, where freight patterns are different and freight demands are different. And some of that is contributing to elongated spot needs. But I do believe as we think about moving forward, you will look to see more published balance.\nShelley Simpson: And I would just add to that, Brian, that for our customers, in the contracted spot market, we have been very disciplined in growing our platform and scaling the platform. We do not believe it\u2019s prudent for our customers or ourselves to accept every order that a customer is asking us to test it outside of our committed capacity. And there have been thousands of shipments per day that we are turning down that we are talking to our customers about, creating a better answer and a better solution in total and that\u2019s part of the reason you see more spot than you see contract as well on top of what Brad talked about. So, I think that\u2019s really important. If I go to your question around automation, we think of J.B. Hunt 360 has a full ecosystem that helps connect our shippers, our carriers and our people to that. So, automation is intended to across those three groups that are interconnected in the platform. Their current automation is intended for our people. And so that\u2019s really connecting our Shipper 360 and Carrier 360 internally for our people and our new system. But we also have other automation ideas for both carriers and for shippers that will help them be more productive over the long-term as well.\nBrad Delco: Hey, Catherine, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey guys and thanks for sneaking me in at the end. So, I guess I will try to encapsulate it here. I mean we are seeing so much inflation on the revenue side and the cost side. And I think a lot of the questions we are getting at this like how much of that\u2019s going to be transitory or how much should your customers be thinking this is just the new cost of doing business. And on the flipside if we do get cost efficiencies and the supply chain opens up next year, I mean is it possible we could see negative rates, but maybe even accretive to margins?\nShelley Simpson: I think that\u2019s a really great question. I certainly hope that the costs that our customers are experiencing today in their budget will not be the long-term price for their budget. There are so many unplanned costs happening in the supply chain today that we can get to a more static and a better, more efficient way to move goods. We see that across all of our segments in total. But I said that the underlying cost of drivers, equipment that is going to stay. I don\u2019t see in this environment taking driver wages down or customers taking their own wages down. Our equipment is not getting any cheaper. So, in segment the question is those two areas are base costs will continue, and that is going to be our new norm. But the way shipments are moving are completely in addition, we can help our customers become so much more efficient, really taking them out of that high cost to serve into more predictable cost servicing capacity over the long-term.\nBrad Delco: Okay. Yes. Thank you, Catherine. I think John wanted to close out with some comments.\nJohn Roberts: Yes. I will just close this up and say I think that you guys did a good job of ladies  to get around the table. We sometimes have too much information to cover, but I thought we did get to touch on the great work happening at J.B. Hunt and the opportunities that are present in that business. Dedicated growth is a good setup for us going forward. I think we continue to see that industry-leading business, our highway services across the board, I think are creating value in this disruptive time. And then just last but not least, we didn\u2019t talk much about Final Mile, but we definitely have to start some of the short-term dynamics there. I think the point I want to make is you can see it as a comprehensive supply chain management approach with an agnostic view of how we help. We will help the best value that we can present to our customers. And so I feel like that the company is well positioned. And I think we are starting to see how the parts connect and how the team is able to pivot and adjust much more quickly today than we have in the past. Of course we are talking about \u201822, and there is a lot of work to be done there. I want to just take through that I am super proud of this team. We have got \u2013 we kept ourselves up sometimes in the hard work we do. And this morning, it\u2019s not only that sometimes we need to just take a deep breath and say to ourselves, hey, nice job. And I think this team deserves that nice job. And I will just close with this. We are working hard on the people side. We heard a lot about labor. We are deeply invested right now at the executive level in our human resources teams, our people teams, as I have mentioned, compensation and benefits and the things that are going to help us stabilize that ability to serve our customers is well underway. And we are thankful to every single member of J.B. Hunt team. They keep us moving, and they keep us in business. And so we are appreciative. Thank you for being on the call today. Catherine, back to you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick and good morning. I will focus my comments on the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and Trucks. I'd like to start off by recognizing all members of our ICS and JBT segments for how they continue to respond in the current environment to elevated demand trends. Our customers continue to present us with opportunities to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions and the team continues to respond very well in these demanding times. The experience of our people, leveraging our technology platform and our physical assets continues to provide us opportunities to source and provide capacity for customers in what continues to be an extremely capacity constrained environment. The ability to source that capacity is enabled by our technology investments into our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and is complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. We continue to invest in these areas as well as in our people to provide more solutions from our customers. I will start with my comments on truck or JBT. Revenue grew 87% year-over-year to $204 million. This is the first quarter that JBT segment has generated over $200 million of revenue since 2007 and we were able to accomplish this with approximately 60% fewer trucks versus that period. This is yet another example of our organization's focus on providing value-added solutions for customers while maintaining our focus on scaling into large addressable markets with our desire for adequate returns on our capital. We believe our drop trailer capacity or 360box is the power-only capacity sourced through our platform provides us an opportunity for sustainable growth. Our trailing capacity increased 20% versus the prior year and 11% from the end of the second quarter and the segment generated $14.7 million of operating income, the highest of any third quarter since 2006. Going forward, we will continue to stay disciplined on our desire to grow, while also focusing on driving greater network efficiencies, particularly in our drop trailer network. Shifting gears to Integrated Capacity Solutions or our ICS segment, ICS delivered $666 million of revenue, breaking our prior quarterly record achieved just last quarter. Revenue grew 55% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 4% in the quarter, while specifically truckload volume growth was 14% year-over-year. The cost of sourcing third-party capacity remains elevated, which is a continuation of the same trends we have seen through the latter parts of 2020 and all of 2021. That said, gross margins did expand 150 basis points sequentially as a result of further scaling of our platform, implementation of higher contractual rates and robust spot opportunities. We believe the market dynamics could tighten even further in the fourth quarter as congestion across the supply chain is likely to compress, the timing of peak season, and intensified customer needs for capacity solutions right up to the holidays. Going forward, we will continue to invest to expand the capabilities and functions of our multimodal digital freight platform for our carriers and customers as well as for our people to drive greater productivity and efficiencies and sourcing cost effective solutions for our customers while giving carriers great visibility to the freight on our platform. In closing, we continue to see solid momentum across our JBT and ICS segments as evidenced by both segments delivering the strongest top line growth across our scroll of services for the fourth consecutive quarter in a row, while much work has been done, there is still much to accomplish, but along the way, we will remain committed to our investments and our people and our technology platform that will drive waste out of the system and help us deliver on our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. This concludes my comments. I will pass it over to Darren. The last thing I would say, this is Brad Hicks, is that recognizing the stress constrain and disruption that puts a lot of pressure on our customers supply chain teams and it plans its way into our group. And we remain remarkably proud of how our talented employees have helped navigate those choppy waters. And so there is a lot of just pressure and stress, and our team has found a way to thrive in that environment on behalf of our customers. Yes. Thanks, Todd. We continue to progress on our strategy and the investments that we have made in our people and our technology that will allow us to scale. And I think as you look back over really the last several quarters, we have continued on that trend, and we remain supportive and optimistic as we continue to move forward into Q4. Obviously, there are a tremendous amount of unknowns that have been discussed at length this morning in all segments of our company as well as with our customers. But the solutions that we are able to provide for our customers in the time of need, they are leaning in and we are being very successful by being able to put them in the most efficient answer, whether that's our highway products on J.B. Hunt 360box, whether that's intermodal or even in ICS. And so I guess said a different way, we remain very pleased with the progress and really see no reason that we won't continue to take steps forward to create leverage as we scale the platform. Yes. Brian, I will start. If I take you back momentarily, we have a strategy going into Q1 that we were maintaining the cost levels that we saw at the end of 2020. And really we didn't win.

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Staying consistent with recent quarters, I will start by providing a couple of comments on our third quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Overall, we are pleased with our revenue growth over the prior year, which was up 27% and the result of improvements in all segments. Our operating income increased 56% with mixed results from some segments that are the result of cost pressures from labor issues, but also due to the significant growth in implementing new contractual businesses that will be addressed in the segment discussions. Interest expense was consistent with prior year and we had a slight increase in our tax rate resulting in earnings per share of $1.88 for the quarter, which is an increase of nearly 60% over the prior year. The impacts of labor shortages, network congestion and just general supply chain challenges are well-known and they persisted in the quarter, again, straining our ability to service the demand and effectively utilize our assets, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Additional cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs and other employee costs of incentive compensation and medical benefits. We ended the quarter with approximately $530 million in cash. At the beginning of the year, we had announced a heavy investment in equipment for 2021. While all orders remain in place, the constraints noted have limited our ability to in-service this equipment. Through unconventional means, including leasing our own private vessels, we are able to add just shy of 3,000 JBI containers and over 900 JBT trailers during the quarter as well as having success in sourcing our tractor needs as a result of solid relationships with our equipment manufacturers. Considering these constraints, we are adjusting our expected CapEx spend for the remainder of 2021 and now expect our CapEx to approximate a little over $1 billion for the full year. We remain committed to obtaining capacity to serve our customers and continue our focus on obtaining the equipment order. While we haven't finalized plans for 2022 yet, our initial expectations are for CapEx to exceed 2021 levels, but will depend largely on the ability and timing to obtaining the equipment. We purchased $50 million of our shares in the third quarter, bringing us to $135 million for the year and anticipate continuing buybacks on a more regular basis. We will continue to balance our cash outlay on equipment, dividends, and buybacks for the remainder of the year as opportunities unfold, trending towards our targeted 1x EBITDA leverage metric on a net basis. In recent quarters, we have updated you on costs directly related to COVID, which have principally been in the form of special bonuses for frontline employees and PTO for employees needing to quarantine. While we still incur these costs, we have now lapped quarters of providing this, and as such, there are no meaningful reconciliations to the prior year quarter. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID focusing on the health and safety of our people while staying informed of state and federal mandates around vaccinations and other protocols. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley and good morning. I will focus my comments on the performance of both our Dedicated Contract Service business, or DCS and the Final Mile Service businesses, FMS. I will also provide you an update from a general operational perspective on both the driver market as well as our ability to source equipment. In our Dedicated business, we continue to see tremendous demand for our professionally outsourced fleet solutions. Propelled by the current market dynamics around driver and equipment availability, our backlog and pipeline remains strong. I am extremely proud of the team's ability to execute this quarter, highlighted by the addition of 744 trucks in the quarter. This is the largest number of truck adds in any single quarter. As historically is the case, startup costs did put pressure on margins in the quarter as we incurred costs before we begin to recognize revenue. But let me be clear, we are extremely pleased with these results as it sets the stage for solid growth and momentum as we roll forward. The new business we have been onboarding represents a broad and diverse mix of customer accounts across both industry verticals and geographies. While we in the industry are facing driver recruitment challenges, customers in most instances have been willing to support our out-of-cycle adjustments to support higher wages for our professional driving workforce. As I alluded to earlier, we continue to see strong demand for our service. And as an update, we have sold 1,899 trucks year-to-date as of September 30 on incremental of 734 trucks from our last update on our second quarter call. Now, transitioning to our Final Mile Services update, we see solid growth opportunities in this market that is and will be supported by our ability to differentiate our service product. As a result, we continue to make investments in our people and processes to support our growth outlook. Relative to some of our recent quarters, profitability was pressured as a result of several factors. Similar to Dedicated, we priced startup costs for the quarter, given the smaller base of business that had a disproportionate impact on our results. Additionally, our contract carriers are also facing labor challenges, particularly for the second seat in the delivery trucks in addition to those at our customer warehouses. Finally and as we discussed last quarter, supply chain issues are impacting product availability, and in turn, our ability to leverage our network to deliver goods potentially in the appliance and furniture categories. We believe these challenges are mostly transitory. Going forward, we are encouraged by the new business we are onboarding and we are on pace for a record new year of sales. We continue to see a solid pipeline of both growth opportunities that we plan to capitalize on in the future. Our success will be largely dependent on our ability to differentiate the service experience for our customers' customer and we remain committed to making the needed investments to achieve that differentiation. Finally, to close on some general operational updates, we have been extremely focused on our hiring efforts in the field to support our growth. As we have discussed in past quarters, we believe J.B. Hunt offers one of the most attractive driving opportunities given the concentration of work in both local and regional applications, combined with top pay and career advancement opportunities. This is also true for our field managers and operations personnel. We have continued to make adjustments to wages and benefits to make our company even more attractive to those seeking a rewarding employment opportunity. Additionally, we have been working closely with our equipment providers in order to support our growth. We have had to hold trades of some of our equipment to support our pipeline, but continue to stay attentive to both maintenance cost and fuel economy as a result. That concludes my remarks. So I will turn it over to Brad. Yes. I would just say that when we look at what we call our core business, we see the operating margin being very acceptable within our range, clearly, with our \u2013 in our range of guidance. So we break that out internally and look at that. So it is operating very well. And then our start-ups are looking very good. We measure those as they are coming out of startup getting to certain hurdle rates. So we're very pleased with the pricing and how that's performing. And then from the backlog I would just say, yes, the backlog is probably a little more than it has been historically. So the demand is still there. There is still a lot of demand for our services and our pipeline is very, very full on the Dedicated and on the Final Mile side. And then on the Final Mile side, it's got a smaller base. And so the start-ups are really dramatically impacting that. Because contractor rates are up and we're just seeing a lot of warehouse labor rates up as well. So we're getting a lot of costs in there. So we've got some supply chain issues, some labor costs that we're addressing. But the demand is still there for our services as well. But the number one impact on Final Mile, I would say, is our startups. That's a good way to get two questions in there in one breath, I guess. On the dedicated side, I would just say that with our demand still pent up, we're going to continue to feel pressure with the startups just before our supply is own start-ups, and we're going to continue to see that moving forward for a while. I would just add that what \u2013 we are seeing really is the customers trying to take control of everything they can, which leans into us, as Shelley said. So, they are getting ships. They are leasing their own ships. They are wanting us to go into ports for them to help them control the experience in there, then the  on the intermodal side with transload and then they are helping us on the Dedicated side with more fleet. So, it's really about customers gaining control of their supply chain and that fits very well with us. Yes. I would just say on the labor situation, it's across the board, its maintenance tax, it's drivers. There is going to be tremendous pressure on wages. I see that continuing on for quite some time, all throughout the supply chain. More on the Biden or the vaccine mandate or testing, we will be compliant with that. And we are working with the third-parties so that we \u2013 if it becomes an order and gets through OSHA, then we will be compliant with it. It will be a lot of bureaucracy. I don't see it really helping the situation much other than causing confusion in the supply chain even more. But we will be compliant with that and follow that process. So, it will have some impact on the industry, but we will make it through."

            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our updated thoughts around peak season and our preliminary planning for 2022. I will also give some updated thoughts on the progress we are making inside our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. We continue to see plenty of opportunities in the market to provide valuable services for customers meeting comprehensive supply chain solutions. While fluidity across the supply chain remains challenging, we are working closely with our customers to develop and execute plans that get their freight delivered. We believe our ability to source capacity on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform continues to differentiate us and our go-to-market strategy and ensure customers find the most efficient way to move their freight. Capacity remains tight across all channels as evidenced by elevated spot and contract rates across all modes of transportation. Further adding to fluidity challenges is the backlog of freight off the West Coast waiting to get unloaded at the ports. We share in these frustrations and are not immune to these impacts as some of our containers are also sitting out in the Pacific waiting to be unloaded. While peak season is upon us, we believe the bottlenecks in the West Coast are going to compact and even intensify further peak season capacity needs into November and December and are preparing ourselves accordingly. As we think about planning for 2022, we will turn our attention to leveraging our people, technology and equipment to not only optimize our customers' freight, but even more important, optimize their freight spend. Freight is moving inefficiently today at elevated truck and spot rates, which will be ripe for conversion to intermodal when we also have the full onboarding of our 12,000 new intermodal containers. While we remain focused on executing our peak season plans, we are also focused on positioning our customers to deliver on their budget for 2022 with the most efficient and cost effective solution available. And again, we stand ready to meet the needs of our customers as we enter the new year. We continue to be extremely encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. Carrier and shipper user activity and engagement metrics continue to accelerate, providing further evidence in the value of being able to optimize and transact in real time and a more frictionless process. With regards to automation, we have completed the pilot of some of our automated tools for matching freight between shippers and carriers and have begun as thoughtfully paste rollout of the system to our personnel in the field. We expect to see additional productivity and service quality benefits over the next year as the system is fully rolled out and utilized. As we move forward, we remain focused on improving access, visibility and transparency on our platform, which we believe sets us up to achieve your mission statement to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. Closing out my comments and similar to a message I shared with you last quarter, I remain extremely encouraged about our position to leverage our people, access and technology to help our customers through their supply chain challenges. Those attributes combined with our experience, tenured workforce and broad and expanding scroll of services is what I believe differentiates us in the market and why I believe customers continue to lean into us during these challenging times. That concludes my comments. And I'd now like to turn it over to Nick. Yes. So we look at our ability to grow intermodal in two areas. So transloading for sure would be an opportunity. If you think about the advantages we can give at the railroads and our customers really is around our operations so because we control really the three critical components: the chassis, the driver and the container. Our ability to create a very fluid network at the destination is very different than what happens today from an international perspective. And when railroads are constrained that allows us to think about and process differently there. The second one is in over-the-road conversions to which I did talk about that in my opening remarks, but we do see a high percentage of shipments that are moving on rail today, part of that our intentional strategy to own any lane that moves intermodal in our highway space. And so we're gaining access and information through our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform, to be able to know what we can and should talk to our customers about converting. So that's going to be a big focus for us as we come through the rest of this fourth quarter, very focused on peak and helping our customers be successful. We also are working closely with them to determine the price that's moving on the highway today that we know to move into intermodal. So I would tell you, those 12,000 boxes I have high confidence in being able to load those at good quality of revenue. And I think, to the earlier question around what we would add would really be dependent on what our customers can do from a fluidity perspective on turning in equipment. And I would say on our Google Strategic Alliance, we are on track and feel confident about of the two big projects that we've been working on our first one is further along. And then the second one, but that's really still timing-wise in good shape. We do have a bigger idea that we have brought to the discussion, and that is a huge focus of what the team is looking into. We're not ready to say whether that would be a 2022 release yet on top of the first two projects, but we do have a more aspirational idea that we're working on in that co-innovation segment. I will try to take that if anybody has anything to add. I think our customers are hopeful that this is not a permanent or long-term position from how the supply chain is operating today. There is too much uncertainty, which is driving too much cost in unplanned events whether that is unplanned on the shipping side, where it should be shipping from or even where it's going to. So, I think there is a good hope that we can create more efficiency. That's something that we are working on with our customers. The last thing we want to do is be inflationary in total without looking first to say what can we do to help our customers meet their budgets overall. I would tell you customers in general. The theme Accelerate was something with so we rolled out in our Sales Summit, February 2020. It could not have been a better theme as we moved into COVID, and we have continued to see our customers accelerate on solutions, idea sets, I think they are leaning more into providers that can do a multitude of different deliveries for them across the supply chain. Certainly, we are seeing that, we are seeing market share gains across all five of our segments. And our customers are asking us to consider and do things we have not done before. And so we are being open to solving for best answers for them. We are agnostic as to how we move a shipment so that helps to create a differentiation in the market for us, but they need a lot of help. They are constrained on labor, not just as for our DC locations, but also just in their office personnel. And so we are leading into our technology, our engineering teams, I would say, across the board. Have a lot of confidence that we are going to be able to continue to take more market share and help our customers be right when it comes to having an efficient supply chain. Ken thank you for those comments. I think all of us know if you go to the shelf today, at a store. Many of those are empty, and we are hearing that directly from our customers as they are somewhat surprised as to what's happening in peak and as well is pushing peak longer into November and December. And that will make for more replenishment in the first quarter and even into the second quarter of next year. So, we do believe that the first quarter will be unusually stronger than it has been in maybe a more typical environment really trying to get their shelves and inventory in the right places in the same time. So, demand from that perspective is still there. In total, don't have great comments about the second half of the year because people are asking us and customers are really trying to do that through their budget process right now. But I would say strong demand, optimistic, feel really good. And then last comment, I have been asking retailers, if they feel like because this Christmas season, the right products won't be on the shelves will gift cards be more here in this Christmas season. And I think that we are leaning to a yes, which means there would be more shopping and more retail sales in January and obviously, more need for us to replenish, any of those goods as well. I might try to add to that. Scale is so important in the platform. We did start on the Carrier 360 side first and then we further launched with Shipper 360. We do believe that we have a good percentage of carriers that are coming into our platform looking at our shelves, if you will, and looking for products. And we have a lot of empty shelves also because you don't have enough freight. And so we are very focused on making sure that our platform is the destination location for carriers to be able to come in, search for what they want and get the product that they need at the right time. We have high confidence in the amount of time that we have actually been with carriers and the different measurements that we are seeing continuing to break records even in this very constrained environment. We are in a new mode with carriers. So, that's allowing us to go back into the demand side to customers in a different way, but scaling is the most important component for us in getting not only revenue growth for our business, but primarily for our bottom line profitability as well. And I would just add to that, Brian, that for our customers, in the contracted spot market, we have been very disciplined in growing our platform and scaling the platform. We do not believe it's prudent for our customers or ourselves to accept every order that a customer is asking us to test it outside of our committed capacity. And there have been thousands of shipments per day that we are turning down that we are talking to our customers about, creating a better answer and a better solution in total and that's part of the reason you see more spot than you see contract as well on top of what Brad talked about. So, I think that's really important. If I go to your question around automation, we think of J.B. Hunt 360 has a full ecosystem that helps connect our shippers, our carriers and our people to that. So, automation is intended to across those three groups that are interconnected in the platform. Their current automation is intended for our people. And so that's really connecting our Shipper 360 and Carrier 360 internally for our people and our new system. But we also have other automation ideas for both carriers and for shippers that will help them be more productive over the long-term as well. I think that's a really great question. I certainly hope that the costs that our customers are experiencing today in their budget will not be the long-term price for their budget. There are so many unplanned costs happening in the supply chain today that we can get to a more static and a better, more efficient way to move goods. We see that across all of our segments in total. But I said that the underlying cost of drivers, equipment that is going to stay. I don't see in this environment taking driver wages down or customers taking their own wages down. Our equipment is not getting any cheaper. So, in segment the question is those two areas are base costs will continue, and that is going to be our new norm. But the way shipments are moving are completely in addition, we can help our customers become so much more efficient, really taking them out of that high cost to serve into more predictable cost servicing capacity over the long-term."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good morning. I am going to focus my comments on three items related to our intermodal business. First, I am going to review performance in the quarter. I will also discuss network fluidity and our continuous effort to improve velocity and capacity for our customers. And finally, I will discuss continued investment in both people and the onboarding of our trailing capacity that we think is going to put us in a solid position to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing for our services and to further support and accelerate the truck to rail conversion opportunities. While demand for our intermodal services remains very strong, our volume performance in the quarter doesn't reflect that as fluidity challenges across our network continued to temper available capacity to serve that demand. As we discussed last quarter, we believe the core challenges around network fluidity for both our rail providers and customers center around the availability of labor and has continued to provide challenges across the entire supply chain. Volumes for the quarter were down 6% and by month, volumes were down 7% in July, down 6% in August, and down 5% in September. Improvements in rail network fluidity, particularly at the terminals and quicker turns of our equipment at customer locations, combined with the onboarding of the new containers would and will help us provide additional capacity. As we discussed last quarter, we implemented programs with our customers to encourage better utilization of our equipment, while protecting our need to generate appropriate returns on our significant investment in both people and equipment to support additional capacity. Importantly, these programs are designed to provide the benefit of additional capacity that results from gained efficiencies. I would say that the results from this program thus far have been mixed. We have some customer locations improve, while other locations have deteriorated even in instances within the same customers' footprint. I would also say, from our perspective, the results of the program have been mixed based simply on the fact that we would absolutely prefer to move more volume and provide more capacity for customers, which was not the case in the quarter. I believe this highlights the severity of the labor challenges across the supply chain. Box turns in the quarter fell sequentially to 1.62 versus 1.65 in the prior quarter, further supporting that view. We continue to be optimistic about the opportunities for long-term sustainable growth in our intermodal business. Customer demand continues to grow and our rail providers continue to view us as a solution to the current congestion challenges that are even more severe in the international intermodal market. Owning our own equipment, including power, trailing and chassis and our highly skilled driver and operations personnel are differentiated in the market particularly around fluidity and service. This is further supported by our J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity when rail congestion or restrictions hamper our ability to serve. In closing, Intermodal's value proposition remains strong as driver and labor challenges continue to plague the supply chain combined with higher energy prices and the fact that an intermodal shipment on average is 60% less carbon intensive than the all-truck alternative. We will continue to make investments to support the meaningful growth opportunities in the market. We expect to take delivery of our entire 12,000 container order by early 2022, setting us up to provide meaningful savings for our customers as we begin the next bid cycle. That concludes my prepared comments. Well, Jon, great question. We are \u2013 continue to be confident that as our customers have growing demand in Southern California, that we have capacity to continue growing with those customers, but we are asking the customers to help us in that area to help us unload faster and create a more fluid capacity solution for us. We're also onboarding additional equipment during the fourth quarter, which will certainly help. But we would anticipate that we will continue to offer additional capacity for our customers as the customers participate in that solution. So that's the key element of this, while getting equipment out of the port is going to drive new demand. But at the same time, the customers have to be able to receive it. And we're working with them. We're supporting them in that area, and that's really, really important for us. Yes. We anticipated this. And unfortunately, we're not going to be able to break that down in any way. I just want to probably remind the entire growth list, and we're not going to break out any sort of accessorial commentary. I think that core pricing was strong going into the third quarter and while costs were also up, and we will always anticipate that our core pricing is maintaining coverage for the cost exposure that we have. We're paying drivers more today. We're hiring outsourced carriers at higher rates today. Our equipment utilization is down. That's driving some of the pricing out there. And certainly, our rail providers also participate in our cost base. So those are all factors that drive core pricing, and we really probably don't have any other commentary on that at this point. Yes. It's fair to assume. Sure. All good thoughts, I think Shelley and I will both comment on this question. For a long time, our target for growth in intermodal has been highway conversion first. But certainly, we have felt that domestic intermodal in a 53-foot container was a benefit to shippers importing through Southern California and the flows of the international equipment and the massive amounts of empties that that flow to various ports in order to get back to Asia, certainly does represent an opportunity. I think that as the international congestion at various rail terminals throughout the interior of the country have driven a lot of conversations with customers that are looking for that solution. We have grown with transload for many, many years now and would anticipate that, that is a primary focus for our growth in the coming years and absolutely plan to capitalize on that. I don't know, Shelley, you may have a comment. Well, I think we've talked about our long-term margin targets of 10 to 12 back at the first quarter call in April, and beyond that commentary, I don't think we can really highlight anything else. Our mission right now is to achieve growth and achieve return on the investment of our equipment, and those are the factors that drive our decisions in intermodal. I think that we are all commonsense people and realize that there will come a time in the congestion eases. We are going to stop very short of predicting when that will happen because like you, we have no idea. But if somebody told me in the second half of \u201822, things will loosen up a bit. I'm not going to be surprised. But at the same time, we're going to have to wait and see. Okay. Let me take that first, and then we will have Nick comment on and some thoughts around driver availability and vaccine mandates as well and other labor thoughts. So, I think our rail providers and the transportation system that we are running, we are recruiting truck drivers at \u2013 in intermodal in addition to the rest of the organization at an extremely rapid pace and it's difficult. I don't want that to come \u2013 it's never been more difficult than it is today to find and attract and retain qualified drivers. It's very, very challenging. And certainly the costs are we are facing that. I believe our rail providers are not immune to it and their contract workers inside the terminals, continues to be a challenge for the rail providers. But I think they have actions in place to counter that. And certainly, at the end of the day, that simply means we all have to compete for that labor. The thing that has been the most difficult for us to get eyes on is customer warehouse labor, and that's where there is a significant bottleneck is our customers' ability to unload the demand that they have. And so when you ask the question about what do we see a future in which that changes. I don't know that we have a line of sight to any kind of real dramatic improvements in it. But what we have line of sight to is our customers have to process their supply chains more efficiently to achieve their goals and that seems logical to us that they will attack this labor situation. Nick, you may have some more?"

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks Brad. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The third quarter continued to present the momentum we spoke of during our last earnings call. We also see persistent irregularities in demand patterns substantially resulting from port, labor and inventory challenges with our customers. The congestion at key inbound port locations has further challenged the desired smoothing of supply chains in preparation for the upcoming holiday season. We find that the dialogue with our key customers reveals both a challenged labor market and a pent-up need to increase the in-stock levels across the system. Planned additions to our container and trailing fleets and the expansion in contract services, both Final Mile and Dedicated should all contribute positively as these headwinds abate. The company is not insulated from the labor dynamics mentioned above for our customers. This year, we have reached all-time highs in the need for company drivers in all segments as well as openings we have on our office and field teams. We have done comprehensive and exhaustive research on our current compensation and benefits programs along with our incentive plans to help better position our jobs going forward. Progress in closing the gaps for both driver and non-driver positions, has been made during the quarter and we are optimistic these gaps will continue to shrink for us. As our executives will discuss today, we are generally pleased with the performance of all segments. However, we do have ample room for improvement with the inventory flows and contractor model in our Final Mile business as well as in the utilization of equipment in intermodal. Even with these opportunities, we see our supply chain focused service is well-positioned and healthy for the long-term needs of our customers. We are also encouraged by the continued progress we see in the utilization of our 360 platforms and the productivity gains resulting from expanded usage across the company with our carriers and with our shippers. The past few weeks have returned us to the annual tradition of honoring our multimillion mile drivers, who over many years accomplished the pinnacle of our profession. In Lowell, we have posted two sessions for a total of over 100 drivers reaching between 2 million and 5 million safe miles along with their families for a 2-day celebration with our entire corporate team. We have been extremely careful to host these sessions following CDC guidelines. Nevertheless, we have done all of us a world of good to see our very best in person again. The energy has been contagious and I assure that it will carry us forward nicely. Please check out our website to see how we recognize these incredible men and women. I will now turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his comments. John? Okay. I think that as we go into next year on the pricing environment, we're probably way early to offer any kind of commentary compared to some of the other we're surprised that anybody would come out and say anything about that at this point. There is just too much unknown today. I mean we've never been in an environment like this and the cost environment is going to drive pricing for us. That's always going to drive our pricing decisions as we're focused on the returns of the investments we put into place. Certainly, the container order for 12,000 that we announced earlier this year, we continue to onboard that equipment as fast as we can get it here. Decisions about advancing the equipment next year will continue as we finalize plans for next year. And frankly, as we continue to work with customers and see what's happening in the market relative to demand velocity improvements that are really available to our customer base to achieve savings not only in what their intermodal experience today, but converting more business off the highway at better pricing compared to truckload can really produce an awful lot of capacity if we can just improve the velocity of the current fleet. All that being said, if we see an opportunity to expand our equipment and the customers are supporting that with pricing, then I have no doubt our organization will set a path to do that, but we have a long way to go before a decision is made on that. Okay. We had said that we expected to get 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3, and I think we highlighted in prepared comments that we were just under 3,000 while we had equipment anchored waiting to unload literally just weeks ago that would have certainly hit on that mark. At this point, I'd say we would end the year somewhere between 8,000 and 9,000 of the boxes onboarded. So we feel like there is an improved cadence in the fourth quarter coming with new boxes onboarding. But we're not immune to the challenges. The port of Los Angeles and onboarding that equipment, that certainly has influenced our ability to get that equipment here, and we will continue to work through it. We feel really good about how we approach that this year, and we will continue to work to that end, but 8,000 to 9,000 by the end of the year, so I'll let you do the math on the fourth quarter. As far as box turn sequential cadence, that's a great question and that we're focusing with our customers every single day on how to improve that number related to their actions that are influencing it. And they are not the only influencer. Certainly, our rail providers are moving somewhat slower than we would have anticipated. So at this point, I would have said at the end of Q2 that I can't imagine it getting worse. And you know what, it did. So I'm going to be cautious to give you any kind of thoughts on that moving forward. I just want to highlight that we're working every single day to improve that number. And that won't end any time we're chasing two turns a month and really anticipate a lot of conversation with our customers on this over the coming months. Let me just \u2013 this is John Roberts finish the thought with the question on the Board, which is we are return on invested capital business. And all of these needs and demands will hit the filter if we do this do we achieve the kind of returns that we are used to and expect and that our owners and our customers frankly expect because we reinvest. But that visibility, we have to performance P&Ls, returns on those investments is vital to that last step of getting the approval to make the investments to continue to grow the business as we have. Yes. I will just close this up and say I think that you guys did a good job of ladies  to get around the table. We sometimes have too much information to cover, but I thought we did get to touch on the great work happening at J.B. Hunt and the opportunities that are present in that business. Dedicated growth is a good setup for us going forward. I think we continue to see that industry-leading business, our highway services across the board, I think are creating value in this disruptive time. And then just last but not least, we didn't talk much about Final Mile, but we definitely have to start some of the short-term dynamics there. I think the point I want to make is you can see it as a comprehensive supply chain management approach with an agnostic view of how we help. We will help the best value that we can present to our customers. And so I feel like that the company is well positioned. And I think we are starting to see how the parts connect and how the team is able to pivot and adjust much more quickly today than we have in the past. Of course we are talking about \u201822, and there is a lot of work to be done there. I want to just take through that I am super proud of this team. We have got \u2013 we kept ourselves up sometimes in the hard work we do. And this morning, it's not only that sometimes we need to just take a deep breath and say to ourselves, hey, nice job. And I think this team deserves that nice job. And I will just close with this. We are working hard on the people side. We heard a lot about labor. We are deeply invested right now at the executive level in our human resources teams, our people teams, as I have mentioned, compensation and benefits and the things that are going to help us stabilize that ability to serve our customers is well underway. And we are thankful to every single member of J.B. Hunt team. They keep us moving, and they keep us in business. And so we are appreciative. Thank you for being on the call today. Catherine, back to you."

At this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO and President, Mr. John Roberts for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad. As we open our earnings call for the second quarter 2021, it makes sense to consider our comparison data with recognition for where we all were this time last year with the onset of the COVID virus. That said, we will continue our discussion on our views of our progress across the enterprise. A general term we believe fits our current position is momentum. We noted for you during our last call that we have meaningfully increased our equipment orders for containers in Intermodal and trailers for the J.B. Hunt 360box program. Through the quarter we gained confidence in these decisions and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak seasons. This is a fluid situation and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022.\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective. As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue, as both ICS and JBT, they were certainly over prior-year quarter, but more importantly, they are carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to serve -- to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages, and other costs across our networks and operations.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customer\u2019s peak season capacity needs, as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly the opportunities are bountiful, but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll of services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight, and challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist, at least through the end of the year.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. I\u2019ll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes. Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged that I have seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren\u2019s comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations, and certainly, over the road driver market. While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest-quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our Dedicated, intermodal dray, Truck and Final Mile operations.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our Highway Services business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions or ICS and Truck or JBT. Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform J.B. Hunt 360 and complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across Highway Services continues to provide value for our customers, as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization. I\u2019ll start with my comments on JBT or Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million. This is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continue to -- continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets, but with our trailing assets. Our ability to solve for the most efficient way a load should move by finding the right carrier, at the right time and at the right price is what continued to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers yes. As we had discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and we\u2019ll remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering, while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future. Next on ICS, the segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, whilst specifically truckload volume growth was up 30%. Market dynamics remained challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels. While capacity remained constrained across the country, the result of which puts seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people, all of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our three critical areas, our people, our technology and scale in the platform, and remain committed to these investments. In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT align with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our Highway Service businesses well into the future. That concludes my comments. I\u2019ll pass it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon everyone listening to today\u2019s call. My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal\u2019s performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations including the onboarding of new containers and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season. Demand for our Intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals and our customers in their warehouse operations. Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in net -- in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted. Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customer\u2019s capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season. On that front we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022. At this time we are through the majority of re-pricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high-single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to re-price to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control. As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean in more capacity and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our Intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost effective alternative to truck and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices, but also because of the environmental benefits of Intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the Truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers, generating appropriate returns in our business reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments.\nBrad Delco: Hey, Mika. Just if you don\u2019t mind, this is Brad, a word to the audience. We\u2019re going to do one question again like we did last quarter. So Mika I will turn it over to you to open the call for questions.\nOperator: All right.  Your first question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good afternoon. So just wanted to ask about Intermodal, you mentioned that the customer detention for equipment is at all-time highs and in the second quarter presumably, you\u2019re charging accessorial. So hoping you could quantify this for us in the quarter relative to what it was in Q1 or sort of a normalized run rate?\nJohn Roberts: Allison, I don\u2019t -- we\u2019ve been talking to our customer base about the impact it\u2019s had on our capacity for really several months and even into last year we\u2019ve really been highlighting this challenge. I don\u2019t know that we had significant changes in the revenue cycle during the quarter as we\u2019ve always talked about that. I think that when we\u2019ve -- what we\u2019ve been doing more recently with our customer base is trying to highlight and incentivize faster unloading. But that was probably towards the end of the second quarter, so beyond that I probably don\u2019t know how to highlight the impact of that during the second quarter.\nAllison Landry: Okay. I mean, I guess, what I\u2019m sort of getting at, I mean, do you think that there was a positive margin benefit that you experienced in Q2 as a result of this that we shouldn\u2019t be modeling again going forward?\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. I just don\u2019t think we can break out accessorial conversation as it relates to the margin. But no, I wouldn\u2019t say, that there was anything material in the quarter related to that.\nAllison Landry: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just on ICS, can you help us understand the gross margin path forward? Clearly, you guys have done well to kind of keep the op given the black there. But, A, what percentage of your book has been re-priced, and B, kind of assuming spot rates don\u2019t collapse from here or kind of are we looking at the current trajectory of gross margin for the back of the year? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Sure. Just to start and I think Shelley might join with a comment or two. But we definitely anticipated that seasonal margin pressure. We highlighted that in our Q1 call and so we were not surprised by the second quarter performance with respect to where we landed. And I think that, historically, the second quarter was always the more pressured gross margin quarter that we experienced. So we would anticipate seeing lift as we move into Q3 and Q4 away from that based on historical norms. Shelley\u2026\nShelley Simpson: Yeah.\nJohn Roberts: \u2026 on the bid data?\nShelley Simpson: Yeah. From a bid season perspective, we\u2019re slightly behind in ICS from where we are in JBI, what is implemented. JBI is further along. I think that\u2019s because of the volatility that\u2019s happening in the brokerage market in general. Just under 60% has been implemented. I would also say that our revenue per load changed inside ICS as a result of moving more business in near-term to contract versus contract with carriers. And so that business and a higher revenue per load did yield a lower gross margin percentage, but our gross margin dollars per load was still up. So it\u2019s a little bit apples and oranges compared to what we have historically done just because the revenue per load has changed so dramatically.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about your ability to ramp Intermodal volumes sequentially in the second half. Shelley, you mentioned a few of the key drivers in the prepared remarks, but is there any color you can give on the number of Intermodal containers you expect to be delivered in the second half and any thoughts around the sequential progression of box turns as we think about your capacity to grow beyond the 500,000 loads in the second quarter?\nDarren Field: Hey, Justin. I think the key to this is certainly customer demand has been very, very strong and velocity has been the bottleneck. We highlighted that we have new containers on the water today. We have strong confidence in our ability to receive between 3,000 and 4,000 during the third quarter. We also highlighted that we feel like of the 12,000 we announced at the first quarter earnings call, some of those will certainly filter into the early stages of 2022. The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter, but for now we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3. I think that on the velocity front, we\u2019re working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That\u2019s certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we\u2019re aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you\u2019re asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter. We think that can improve somewhat to slightly in the third quarter, but not yet ready to believe it\u2019s going to be a real material impact at this.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thank you, Darren.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks so much. Hi, everyone. Darren, another Intermodal question. We\u2019ve obviously had some updates from the rail Union Pacific shutdown eastbound movements to their global for terminal. I think BM has also started to meter space on its own intermodal trains at least through the end of this month. Can you just help us think about what the volume impact is, a little bit similar to the last question in terms of what the headwind this may be as you move from the second quarter to third quarter? And then you\u2019ve been really helpful in the past about talking about maybe the margin progression expectations and you\u2019ve been bang on in terms of sequential margin improvement as the pricing further gets implemented. You guys have shown good drop through in the Intermodal on the incremental revenue growth at least sequentially as some of the pricing comes through, should that just be a continuation into the third quarter as that 30% gets re-priced? What\u2019s the right expectation around margins, if you can just answer those two questions? Thank you very much.\nBrad Hicks: Hi, Amit. This is Brad. I\u2019ll take the first part of that. I think Darren did a really good job of giving a lot of details on expectations for box turns and containers, and clearly, where demand is. So I don\u2019t think we need to address anything more in terms of expectations for volume. I\u2019ll let Darren provide comments on the rail service and maybe the UMP stuff, but I just wanted to get that point across. So Darren?\nDarren Field: Sure. So, Amit, appreciate the questions. The thing on the restrictions that you\u2019ve heard from UMP is those are, well, we don\u2019t operate on Union Pacific, but it\u2019s largely understood to be international only. So there is not a lot of impact to us on domestic volumes. And BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working really well together every day in an effort to expand our capacity and improve velocity, and everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that we are doing that and working with our customers on scheduling, we\u2019re draying loads out of the terminals. We\u2019re doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity. So when you\u2019re hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it\u2019s more international focus than it is domestic. We have some energy from that as, I think, the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals. And certainly, if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only.\nAmit Mehrotra: And then the margin progression question.\nDarren Field: Oh! The margin. I think we said that, on the last call, we restated our long-term margin target of 10% to 12%. We said, we thought we would make some improvement as 2021 went on and as we implemented prices and that continues to be true. We\u2019re inside that range and feel good moving forward that we will stay inside that range.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I know you -- it sounds like you don\u2019t want another volume question but I had one because I\u2019m not so clear. Do you -- I mean, I guess, I\u2019ll just ask it directly, do you think you can grow volumes year-over-year in the third quarter? And then on -- just to follow up on the margin side, as these accessorials kick in some more and you get the full impact of pricing, do you think that there is potential to get towards the upper end of that margin guidance towards the back half of the year?\nBrad Hicks: Hi, Scott. This is going to be Brad again. I mean, I think, Shelley, in her prepared remarks talked about volume will be influenced by three main factors, rail fluidity, the tension at customer locations, as well as the onboarding of our new containers. And we -- some of those are out of our control. We talked to you and Darren gave you specific guidance on what we think containers will do in the quarter. So other than that it\u2019s going to be hard to give you anything more specific than what we have. So I\u2019ll just respond to that part of the question. And then to your second part, I\u2019ll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: I\u2019m going to need a quick refresh on the second part.\nBrad Hicks: Scott, refresh us on the second part of your question.\nScott Group: Yeah. It was just about as we get the full impact of the pricing and the accessorials, do we -- is there a potential to get to the upper end of that margin range? And then maybe just to clarify the first part of that volume question, Darren, you mentioned June a year ago was a month where you had the boxes in the right place, was that the same scenario? Did you have the boxes in the right place in the third quarter last year, I just don\u2019t really remember?\nDarren Field: Okay. Well, I\u2019ll just hit on that real quick and then we will hopefully move on from the volume stuff. So we depleted our stored containers in -- at the -- during June of 2020, which largely created a lot of very fast fluidity for us, because we had gone into storage during the really weakened part of the second quarter last year. So during the third quarter demand was so strong? No, we didn\u2019t have equipment really positioned strongly. So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago. On the margin front, it\u2019s a range, because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it? It really depends on some of the cost challenges, and at this point, there is not let up on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers, there is no let up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal. So all of those cost challenges are real, so we just got to stick within the, say that, it\u2019s going to be within the range and I think that\u2019s really all I can comment on the margin.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Scott. If I could add to that. We are working on -- at a very tactical level with our customers on a regular basis, probably, the most detailed plans that I have seen is work with our customers to try to avoid those charges. So we\u2019re doing a lot on the front end to try to identify where the bottlenecks are. Our intent is to move more volume. We do have to have these three things come in line, but we really haven\u2019t thought about it. Our accessorials are not there for us to gain incremental or even more margin dollars to our bottom line. Our accessorials are there. So that if we can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s happening as those containers and 360boxes are dwelling that we can be properly rewarded for that box sitting.\nScott Group: Makes sense. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is now open.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah. Good afternoon. Maybe a question on DCS, if I could, if you could just give us a little bit of sense of maybe how the pace of new fleet acquisitions will go in the back half of the year and maybe sort of contrast that with how we should expect startup costs to kind of ramp, obviously, it was a bit of a heavy quarter this quarter, curious if that persist in 3Q and into 4Q or do you see it decelerate a little bit?\nJohn Roberts: All right. Well, based on our pipeline, we think that, well, you saw Q2 was very strong. We think Q3 will be strong as well and it\u2019s hard to tell on Q4. We got -- make sure we got equipment. We got to make sure we got drivers. So, there\u2019s just a lot of unknowns that far out. I will say that the pipeline is full, but there is a lot of things that go into metering how fast we can start those up, drivers, equipment and even some on the management side. So, but I would say Q3 is looking very strong as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good evening. So great job in keeping rates ahead of costs, and Nick, talked a little bit about the hardest hiring environment in 37 years, and Nick and Brad, I think everybody highlighted the labor pressures to keep fluidity. So, John, maybe step back and give a little bit of your thoughts on labor and when you think about hearing impacts of embargoes on some of the networks, are there any concern that the network starts to meltdown like we\u2019ve seen on some of the rail networks when it starts spreading and spreading out wider from just one area, especially when you\u2019re adding capacity when the rail network is not fluid? Is there a concern that it gets gummed up and they\u2019re not able to take advantage of their precision scheduled railroading overhauls?\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. Ken, let me have Darren respond to that. I think he\u2019ll have a better look at it.\nDarren Field: So is there a concern of a meltdown, I think, that the railroads have all shown a fairly quick step in to slow volume down if heading towards that kind of a challenge. 2021 has been certainly an unusual year. So, but, no, I don\u2019t expect any kind of meltdown from the railroads. I do think that when we talk about labor challenges with the rail system, I mean, I really do think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re talking about locations that need to find 4% or 5% more employees in order to be fully staffed and overcome kind of a challenge that they\u2019re in now. These aren\u2019t just massive, massive amounts of people that they need to hire. So it feels like that would be highly unusual and I think all of the railroads are very focused on these challenges and they are out addressing them. And I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re -- that some sort of a significant meltdown is a very significant risk at this point.\nOperator: All right. Next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is now open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good afternoon. Well, I guess, a related question. I mean it seems like labor is such an important topic. I wanted to get your thoughts on how you look at labor intensity of your model. I tend to think Intermodal is obviously less driver intensive than trucks. So you would have some advantage versus truck in a tight labor market. But just wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts about does this tight labor market provide advantage to J.B. Hunt in a certain way? And then if you could also just say, have you seen any signs of improvement? I think we\u2019ve got, I know if it\u2019s 25 or 26 states that I think it started to ease up on the payment of the bonus unemployment. So is that improving or is there kind of no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of labor availability? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: I would just say from a labor standpoint, I would say, as I said in my comments, very, very tight. I think we do a very good job responding to that. Our model is pretty agile, very site specific on how we can address individual labor concerns whether it\u2019s in some of our fulfillment warehouses, Final Mile or whether it\u2019s Intermodal rail ramp specifically. So I think we have a very solid approach and then we got a very robust corporate driver personnel team that helps us in the labor market. So it\u2019s challenging. And then I would just say the other side of it is, we have very good, as Shelley alluded to relationships with our customer. We\u2019re very open. We try to stay ahead of that, show them metrics in those areas and try to get ahead of that with them. So I think it\u2019s an advantage to us, personally in the tight market. Now does that mean we don\u2019t have pain? No, we have pain, but probably not as much as others. And then on your question about unemployment, it\u2019s too early to say. We\u2019ve been having some conversations about can we measure in the states that\u2019s rolled back the unemployment benefits? Have we been able to recruit more there? It\u2019s too early for us to tell. I think by the end of Q3, we\u2019ll have a better feel for that. I know at the end of September, supposedly the rest of the country will roll back on that. So I think it will just kind of become very clear at that time. But it\u2019s too early right now to tell. Most of that\u2019s in the South and if I was going to say any area was a little less pressured than the other it would be in the South a little less pressured, they\u2019re all pressured, but a little less pressure there in general, so..\nJohn Roberts: I\u2019d just add to that, Nick, on your first part of your question, you use the term or we have good agility and I think that that\u2019s very well represented in the pivot that we\u2019ve made in our strategy in JBT moving more towards an asset-light. And I think that that\u2019s facilitated the growth that we\u2019ve experienced over the last several quarters that we\u2019ve been talking about records since 2007 and 2008 by going to that asset-light model and tapping into the carrier base that we\u2019ve had access to via ICS. And so 360 platform has certainly enabled us to be more flexible for our customers and be able to do more for them in that environment is just another good example of that.\nShelley Simpson: And I might just finally add. One of the things with our customers we certainly talk to them about where our pain points are at. But it is much easier today for us to say, yes, and to make a pickup on behalf of a customer. It really comes down to costs. So when we take our more than 20,000 drivers and extend that to our platform reaching nearly 1 million trucks, our ability to source on behalf of our customers is significantly different than what it would have been maybe in the last cycle. So we can always say, yes. It\u2019s just down to cost and what that means from a pressure perspective, helping us meet with our customers and helping make sure that their budgets are intact.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about ICS and 360 in particular. So some of the employee count was up a little bit at the end of the period from the first quarter, but the average number of loads per employee was still so pretty good moving favorably. So I wanted to see if we could talk about just productivity on the platform and then here in the near-term maybe for the rest of the year? And then just give us an update in terms of the roadmap, the investments going forward here across the different metrics, as you should look at in terms of people, technology and scale. It seems like you made progress in all that, but also seems like you\u2019ve got some more investments to be had, so maybe if you can give us an update on productivity and where you see the investments going next for 360? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. A lot inside of that question. Yeah. We\u2019re definitely satisfied with the progress that we\u2019ve made. Appreciate you gravitating towards our three critical areas of our people, our technology and scale. I think that that has been demonstrated over the last several quarters and as we continue to grow on the scale, we\u2019ve gotten back to profitability, which we\u2019ve talked about for the last eight quarters that investment window. Investments will continue on. Obviously, with the work that we\u2019re doing with Google and the co-innovation that will come from that will allow us to make good decisions around how we continue to invest to enhance 360 platform and how we can make sure that we\u2019re providing value for our customers and for carriers. I think it\u2019s clear that our goals are to create the most efficient transportation network in North America and we feel real good about where we sit with respect to that. I would say that, the things that are most important to our customer is really cost, service and capacity, and our investments continue to focus around visibility, transparency and access, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to make decisions on how we move forward. Shelley, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that.\nShelley Simpson: Yeah. I might just add that as we are looking at our five-year modeling that we\u2019ve put in place when we very first rolled out 360, we have made good improvements across the Board. We still do see -- I mentioned this, I believe at the end of last year that we did have some internal work happening in 360 with our internal systems called Match that will help us connect our people with what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. And so really allowing us to use that frictionless digital platform externally and connecting that with people when we really need to be problem solvers on behalf of our customers and our carriers and so we\u2019ve made improvements there. We do still have improvements left that need to occur in our five-year modeling. And then certainly in the scaling piece, our gross margins as a percentage, those numbers we still believe that we will continue to find the right truck at the right time, at the right price that will allow us to continue to expand margins inside that overall.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit to Final Mile profitability. I think the long-term target range is 4% to 8%. You\u2019ve kind of been in there the first half. With probably what\u2019s going to be a strong peak, I mean, could -- and the various cost pressures, do you think we could stay sort of within general targeted range through the balance of the year? Thanks.\nBrad Hicks: Yeah. I\u2019d say we\u2019re clearly moving in that direction. There is a lot of things going on. One, there is a lot of cost pressure that you alluded to inside the warehouse of loading of our box trucks, second seat only, even our contractors, so contractor labor rates are going up. So we\u2019re facing some headwinds there. But the other part of it is just the supply chain. We\u2019re at the very end of the supply chain. So we got to make sure that the product is there. The furniture industry, if you look at that, there\u2019s a lot of long lead times, chips are affecting a lot of the appliance folks. So there\u2019s just a lot of things going on in that, but our plan is to stay in that target range, but there is a lot of headwinds towards you. So it\u2019s hard to clearly say right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Zazula from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDavid Zazula: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe another one for Brad on Final Mile, you mentioned the revenue per stop is down due to a shift between the asset-based and asset-light segments of that segment. I wonder if you could just comment on whether that\u2019s just kind of the normal course of business or whether that\u2019s an intentional shift towards a more asset-light model within Final Mile?\nBrad Hicks: We are very agnostic with our customers. We present both pricings. And so it just depends on which customer is buying at the time. Right now it seems to be the non-asset was -- what was being bought recently. But I would just tell you a couple of deals on the asset side right now. So it moves around, but what I see in the pipeline, I would say is more on the non-asset side for the most part. There is still an asset play that moves in there every once in a while and so it moves around. It\u2019s hard to predict. We\u2019re pricing all of them. And so we just adjust our ROIC based on the amount of capital we have to put in there. So, but the pipeline, I would say, is more on the non-asset side right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Fowler from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thank you. Brad Delco, can I ask what Intermodal volumes were yesterday? Is that okay?\nBrad Delco: Operator, next question please. I am just kidding, Todd. Go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: No. You\u2019re partially kidding. I understand. And I\u2019m kidding\u2026\nBrad Delco: Oh! Yeah. Thanks. You\u2019re absolutely right. Partially kidding.\nTodd Fowler: What I did want to ask about is, there\u2019s a lot of anticipation, a lot of hype around this peak season. So maybe partially for Shelley, maybe partially for John Kuhlow, as we think about kind of peak planning with the expectation be that this is more of an elongated peak and our customers are going to start the pull forward activity earlier than what we typically see? And then how do we think about the seasonality of either EBIT or the earnings cadence in the second half of the year, should that follow kind of the change in customer shipping habits or is it just a situation where we\u2019re going to be at this elevated level for a longer period of time just where the demand environment is? Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Todd. I\u2019ll take the customer side and then I\u2019ll turn it over to John on the last part of the question. The disruption that occurred in 2020 has continued all the way through today and we believe will continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective and we have heard our customers say they moved from being ordering from a need by date to a when can you get it to me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that typically would not be there. So there has been some pull-forward. I think it\u2019s just been based on a lot of the disruption that\u2019s happened particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well and it\u2019s certainly we know the problems there occurring across every parts of the supply chain in delivering goods for our customers. I would say our customers from a demand perspective believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well. And finally, I would say, peak season, we are doing a ton of peak planning. I talked about that on the last earnings call. We are doing that again now and we\u2019re really doing that comprehensively across all of our five segments. And so, how can we help understand the needs of our customers, what that will look like and then what will we do when more disruption occurs in locations that are outside of what we are focusing on from a peak perspective? The sooner we can do that the more success we will have together with our customers.\nJohn Kuhlow: And Todd, apologize, but I probably have to shoot down your second question that don\u2019t really know how I can answer that without giving you guidance on our margins for the second half. What I will say is, as Shelley mentioned, we\u2019re doing everything we can to talk with our customers and understand what their demands are. We\u2019re trying to get as many resources as possible, both people and assets with the equipment orders that we have put in place to try and be in the best position to address those needs. And as Darren mentioned, working with the rails to see what we can do to try to alleviate some of this congestion. So we\u2019ve given margin target guidance ranges and that\u2019s really all the further I can add to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the time. Question for you on longer term CapEx, I\u2019m just wondering kind of as you look across demand for equipment, I mean, to this year and then to next year, should we be expecting sort of a multiyear sort of level of elevated CapEx or do you feel like we should be seeing the recovery in rail service and box turns that would allow you to kind of deliver with a little bit less than we\u2019re spending in fiscal 2021?\nJohn Kuhlow: Well, I\u2019ll provide just some comments on consolidated CapEx and what we\u2019re looking at. As we mentioned, some of what \u2014 the orders that we have placed, some of those are going to be pushed into 2022. We haven\u2019t changed those orders and so, that will move. And so I would expect that our 2022 CapEx is going to be elevated as well. We\u2019re still trying to understand what the replacement and growth needs are. Frankly, we have reduced some of our trade-in this year on tractors, just to continue to maintain the available capacity and so we will probably have a higher CapEx in 2022 with that as well. So those are -- right now, I would say, that our 2022 CapEx is going to be not as high as 2021, but will be elevated over what we\u2019ve seen historically.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and thank you for taking my question. Shelley, you had mentioned earlier about how customer inventories were as tight as you\u2019ve seen them. Is there any way we can put that into perspective either with anecdotes or just to give us an idea of where inventory levels are at customer x or customer y relative to where they should be?\nShelley Simpson: Well, I can\u2019t speak specific at the customer level. Obviously, I have some of those anecdotal stories. But I think it\u2019s, what I said earlier which is, they don\u2019t have the inventory exactly where they wanted or at the timing that they wanted, either. I think there are concerns about this Christmas season and will they have all of the necessary inventory on shelf or available through e-commerce channels. So that\u2019s a concern of our customers. Inventory will take some time to catch up just to more normal levels. But there are several stories from our customers whether it\u2019s Christmas product already here in stock ahead of schedule or concern that their peak shipments that are supposed to be on the water aren\u2019t on the water yet and so there is a lot of concern coming here into the back half of this year.\nBrad Delco: Okay. Mika, thank you. This is Brad. I just want to thank everybody for the questions. Obviously, we will be in touch with you guys in three months and if you have anything before then, feel free to reach out. My email address and phone number is on our earnings release. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon. My comments today will focus on the performance of our Highway Services business during the quarter, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions or ICS and Truck or JBT. Let me start off by saying how excited I am to see our team respond to the opportunities our customers present us with to deliver both truck and trailing capacity solutions to serve their needs. These capacity solutions were enabled by our multimodal digital freight platform J.B. Hunt 360 and complemented by our drop trailer pools with 360box. Additionally, these capacity solutions across Highway Services continues to provide value for our customers, as evidenced by this most recent performance being the third quarter in a row in which both ICS and JBT delivered the strongest growth within our organization. This continues to support our decisions to focus our investments on our people and technology, which is driving further scale across the platform and our organization. I'll start with my comments on JBT or Truck segment. Revenue grew 70% to $184 million. This is the highest revenue this segment has delivered since the second quarter of 2008. Operating income was $14 million, which was the highest second quarter level achieved by the segment since 2007. Our growth and performance continue to -- continues to be driven by our ability to provide capacity solutions with or without our physical trucking assets, but with our trailing assets. Our ability to solve for the most efficient way a load should move by finding the right carrier, at the right time and at the right price is what continued to drive strong demand for our 360box product. More importantly, our ability to access capacity quickly has allowed us to be able to tell our customers yes. As we had discussed in prior calls, we continue to see the business shifting to a more asset-light model and we'll remain focused on investing and scaling our service offering, while staying focused on generating adequate returns on our investment. This will require a focus on balancing our growth with network efficiencies as we scale in the future. Next on ICS, the segment delivered $608 million of revenue, which broke our previous record set in the fourth quarter just last year. Revenue grew 100% versus the prior year period. Segment volumes grew 20% within the quarter, whilst specifically truckload volume growth was up 30%. Market dynamics remained challenged as freight demand strengthened from already elevated levels. While capacity remained constrained across the country, the result of which puts seasonal pressure on net revenue margins, which was consistent with our expectation. We continue to see solid trends with our carrier and shipper engagement on the 360 platform and remain encouraged by the productivity we are seeing with our people, all of which is enabled by our investments in both our people and technology. We continue to see opportunities to invest in our three critical areas, our people, our technology and scale in the platform, and remain committed to these investments. In closing, our performance this quarter in ICS and JBT align with one of our key objectives, which is to grow volume and gain market share by leveraging our platform and using data to help our customers make the best decisions and deliver value to their supply chains. We do this by eliminating waste in the system and creating a frictionless way to access vast amounts of capacity across a multimodal digital freight platform. We remain excited about our opportunity to deliver our capacity solutions to our customers across our Highway Service businesses well into the future. That concludes my comments. I'll pass it over to Darren. Hi, Amit. This is Brad. I'll take the first part of that. I think Darren did a really good job of giving a lot of details on expectations for box turns and containers, and clearly, where demand is. So I don't think we need to address anything more in terms of expectations for volume. I'll let Darren provide comments on the rail service and maybe the UMP stuff, but I just wanted to get that point across. So Darren? Hi, Scott. This is going to be Brad again. I mean, I think, Shelley, in her prepared remarks talked about volume will be influenced by three main factors, rail fluidity, the tension at customer locations, as well as the onboarding of our new containers. And we -- some of those are out of our control. We talked to you and Darren gave you specific guidance on what we think containers will do in the quarter. So other than that it's going to be hard to give you anything more specific than what we have. So I'll just respond to that part of the question. And then to your second part, I'll turn it over to Darren. Scott, refresh us on the second part of your question. Yeah. I'd say we're clearly moving in that direction. There is a lot of things going on. One, there is a lot of cost pressure that you alluded to inside the warehouse of loading of our box trucks, second seat only, even our contractors, so contractor labor rates are going up. So we're facing some headwinds there. But the other part of it is just the supply chain. We're at the very end of the supply chain. So we got to make sure that the product is there. The furniture industry, if you look at that, there's a lot of long lead times, chips are affecting a lot of the appliance folks. So there's just a lot of things going on in that, but our plan is to stay in that target range, but there is a lot of headwinds towards you. So it's hard to clearly say right now. We are very agnostic with our customers. We present both pricings. And so it just depends on which customer is buying at the time. Right now it seems to be the non-asset was -- what was being bought recently. But I would just tell you a couple of deals on the asset side right now. So it moves around, but what I see in the pipeline, I would say is more on the non-asset side for the most part. There is still an asset play that moves in there every once in a while and so it moves around. It's hard to predict. We're pricing all of them. And so we just adjust our ROIC based on the amount of capital we have to put in there. So, but the pipeline, I would say, is more on the non-asset side right now."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start with providing a couple of comments on our second quarter just from a consolidated perspective. As John noted, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for the quarter with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue, as both ICS and JBT, they were certainly over prior-year quarter, but more importantly, they are carrying the momentum from their first quarter results into the second. Current quarter was significantly impacted by labor shortages, putting a strain on our ability to serve -- to service demand and effectively use our assets. Cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher purchase transportation costs, salaries and wages, and other costs across our networks and operations. And Todd, apologize, but I probably have to shoot down your second question that don't really know how I can answer that without giving you guidance on our margins for the second half.

I'm going to spend my time giving a brief operational update focused on the current driver market and some other processes we are reviewing, in addition to providing some greater detail on the performance of DCS and Final Mile Services in the quarter. I'll start with some quick thoughts from our operational perspective focused on the current state of the driver market in addition to our current review of some of our processes. Consistent with my comments from last quarter, the driver market remains as challenged that I have seen in my 37-year career. As you will hear from Darren's comments in a few moments, we believe the availability of labor is having a meaningful impact across almost every part of the supply chain, ranging from the ports to rail terminal operations, warehouse operations, and certainly, over the road driver market. While we continue to believe we are in a relatively solid position with some of the best paying and highest-quality jobs in the market with over 90% of our jobs being either local or regional in our Dedicated, intermodal dray, Truck and Final Mile operations. I would just say from a labor standpoint, I would say, as I said in my comments, very, very tight. I think we do a very good job responding to that. Our model is pretty agile, very site specific on how we can address individual labor concerns whether it's in some of our fulfillment warehouses, Final Mile or whether it's Intermodal rail ramp specifically. So I think we have a very solid approach and then we got a very robust corporate driver personnel team that helps us in the labor market. So it's challenging. And then I would just say the other side of it is, we have very good, as Shelley alluded to relationships with our customer. We're very open. We try to stay ahead of that, show them metrics in those areas and try to get ahead of that with them. So I think it's an advantage to us, personally in the tight market. Now does that mean we don't have pain? No, we have pain, but probably not as much as others. And then on your question about unemployment, it's too early to say. We've been having some conversations about can we measure in the states that's rolled back the unemployment benefits? Have we been able to recruit more there? It's too early for us to tell. I think by the end of Q3, we'll have a better feel for that. I know at the end of September, supposedly the rest of the country will roll back on that. So I think it will just kind of become very clear at that time. But it's too early right now to tell. Most of that's in the South and if I was going to say any area was a little less pressured than the other it would be in the South a little less pressured, they're all pressured, but a little less pressure there in general, so.."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions, our expectations and plan for our customer's peak season capacity needs, as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our J.B. Hunt 360 multimodal digital freight platform. As we discussed last quarter, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities the market could present to us during the year. Now that the year is just halfway over, clearly the opportunities are bountiful, but so too are the challenges. Demand for our capacity solutions across the scroll of services remains at elevated levels. Capacity across the supply chain remains tight, and challenges around velocity and fluidity are still very present and likely to persist, at least through the end of the year. Yeah. Yeah. From a bid season perspective, we're slightly behind in ICS from where we are in JBI, what is implemented. JBI is further along. I think that's because of the volatility that's happening in the brokerage market in general. Just under 60% has been implemented. I would also say that our revenue per load changed inside ICS as a result of moving more business in near-term to contract versus contract with carriers. And so that business and a higher revenue per load did yield a lower gross margin percentage, but our gross margin dollars per load was still up. So it's a little bit apples and oranges compared to what we have historically done just because the revenue per load has changed so dramatically. Hey, Scott. If I could add to that. We are working on -- at a very tactical level with our customers on a regular basis, probably, the most detailed plans that I have seen is work with our customers to try to avoid those charges. So we're doing a lot on the front end to try to identify where the bottlenecks are. Our intent is to move more volume. We do have to have these three things come in line, but we really haven't thought about it. Our accessorials are not there for us to gain incremental or even more margin dollars to our bottom line. Our accessorials are there. So that if we can't anticipate what's happening as those containers and 360boxes are dwelling that we can be properly rewarded for that box sitting. And I might just finally add. One of the things with our customers we certainly talk to them about where our pain points are at. But it is much easier today for us to say, yes, and to make a pickup on behalf of a customer. It really comes down to costs. So when we take our more than 20,000 drivers and extend that to our platform reaching nearly 1 million trucks, our ability to source on behalf of our customers is significantly different than what it would have been maybe in the last cycle. So we can always say, yes. It's just down to cost and what that means from a pressure perspective, helping us meet with our customers and helping make sure that their budgets are intact. Yeah. I might just add that as we are looking at our five-year modeling that we've put in place when we very first rolled out 360, we have made good improvements across the Board. We still do see -- I mentioned this, I believe at the end of last year that we did have some internal work happening in 360 with our internal systems called Match that will help us connect our people with what's happening in the marketplace. And so really allowing us to use that frictionless digital platform externally and connecting that with people when we really need to be problem solvers on behalf of our customers and our carriers and so we've made improvements there. We do still have improvements left that need to occur in our five-year modeling. And then certainly in the scaling piece, our gross margins as a percentage, those numbers we still believe that we will continue to find the right truck at the right time, at the right price that will allow us to continue to expand margins inside that overall. Thank you, Todd. I'll take the customer side and then I'll turn it over to John on the last part of the question. The disruption that occurred in 2020 has continued all the way through today and we believe will continue through the rest of this year and into next year. Our customers do have a displacement happening from an inventory perspective and we have heard our customers say they moved from being ordering from a need by date to a when can you get it to me date. And so there is inventory in the supply chain today that has already been delivered that typically would not be there. So there has been some pull-forward. I think it's just been based on a lot of the disruption that's happened particularly in the global supply chain. So that has caused kind of the upstream issues that are now hitting in the U.S. as well and it's certainly we know the problems there occurring across every parts of the supply chain in delivering goods for our customers. I would say our customers from a demand perspective believe that the rest of this year will be strong into next year as well. And finally, I would say, peak season, we are doing a ton of peak planning. I talked about that on the last earnings call. We are doing that again now and we're really doing that comprehensively across all of our five segments. And so, how can we help understand the needs of our customers, what that will look like and then what will we do when more disruption occurs in locations that are outside of what we are focusing on from a peak perspective? The sooner we can do that the more success we will have together with our customers. Well, I can't speak specific at the customer level. Obviously, I have some of those anecdotal stories. But I think it's, what I said earlier which is, they don't have the inventory exactly where they wanted or at the timing that they wanted, either.

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon everyone listening to today's call. My comments this afternoon will focus on Intermodal's performance during the quarter. I will also provide some additional details on network operations including the onboarding of new containers and how we are working to improve velocity and in turn capacity in our network for and on behalf of our customers as we approach peak season. Demand for our Intermodal capacity remains robust. In fact, demand continues to significantly outpace our available capacity, which remains constrained by rail performance and restrictions in addition to customer detention of our trailing equipment. We continue to believe that the origin of these challenges center on the availability of labor for both the railroads, particularly in their terminals and our customers in their warehouse operations. Volumes in the quarter increased 6%, broken down by month as plus 17% in April, plus 8% in May and minus 6% in June. As we discussed a year ago, June 2020 was a particularly strong month for us as we had equipment properly positioned for the surge in net -- in demand as the activity across the supply chain restarted. Network velocity continues to be well below our expectations as evidenced by our box turns, which were approximately 1.65 turns per month during the quarter. We are working very closely with our rail providers and customers to improve our capacity across the network by focusing on reducing the detention of equipment and helping our rail providers reduce congestion across their terminal infrastructure. Going forward, the onboarding of our new equipment will also assist us in serving our customer's capacity needs, particularly as we approach peak season. On that front we began taking delivery of our new equipment in the last few weeks and have even more on the water as we speak. We expect a steady flow of equipment into the West Coast at this point moving forward, which is now likely to stretch into early 2022. At this time we are through the majority of re-pricing efforts for this latest bid season and rates came in at the higher end of our earlier expectation, which our original expectations were for high-single to low double-digit increases. By the end of the quarter, about 70% of the volume had current bid cycle rates and we expect the remaining 30% of the business yet to re-price to implement in Q3. Inflationary cost pressures continue to present themselves in the way of driver wages and recruitment costs in addition to the cost of equipment ownership, particularly as utilization levels remain challenged by both the rail and customer activity previously discussed. We believe we have put in place the right pricing structure and programs that protect our necessity to generate an adequate return on our significant investment in our people and our equipment even if box turns remain challenged due to events outside of our control. As we approach peak season, it is clear that our customers continue to want to lean in more capacity and we feel very confident in our ability to execute our plan. Customers value our Intermodal service offering as it continues to be a very cost effective alternative to truck and even more so now due to rapidly rising driver wages and fuel prices, but also because of the environmental benefits of Intermodal as its carbon intensity is 60% lower than the Truck alternative. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize delivering value to our customers, generating appropriate returns in our business reinvesting to meet their future capacity needs and keeping us on a path toward long-term sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments. Hey, Justin. I think the key to this is certainly customer demand has been very, very strong and velocity has been the bottleneck. We highlighted that we have new containers on the water today. We have strong confidence in our ability to receive between 3,000 and 4,000 during the third quarter. We also highlighted that we feel like of the 12,000 we announced at the first quarter earnings call, some of those will certainly filter into the early stages of 2022. The team is working every day to continue to receive more containers as we move into the fourth quarter, but for now we can highlight 3,000 to 4,000 in Q3. I think that on the velocity front, we're working with customers to find ways to free up the equipment faster. That's certainly an ongoing effort. And then the railroads, the key there is getting faster velocity out of the rail system. And we're aligned with all of our rail providers on their mission to improve their velocity. And so that is an expectation of ours during the quarter. If you're asking for specifics, we highlighted 1.65 turns in the second quarter. We think that can improve somewhat to slightly in the third quarter, but not yet ready to believe it's going to be a real material impact at this. Sure. So, Amit, appreciate the questions. The thing on the restrictions that you've heard from UMP is those are, well, we don't operate on Union Pacific, but it's largely understood to be international only. So there is not a lot of impact to us on domestic volumes. And BNSF and J.B. Hunt are working really well together every day in an effort to expand our capacity and improve velocity, and everything we can do to create fluidity at the terminals in order to help provide that we are doing that and working with our customers on scheduling, we're draying loads out of the terminals. We're doing a tremendous amount of work in order to improve fluidity. So when you're hearing some of that restriction information, sometimes it's more international focus than it is domestic. We have some energy from that as, I think, the international supply chain has been one of the more significant drags on productivity for the various rail terminals. And certainly, if they can be focused on eliminating some of the congestion from international in order to free up capacity for domestic, we would certainly stand to have some benefit from that. I'm not saying that's what they're doing, but certainly the announcement from UMP was focused on international only. Oh! The margin. I think we said that, on the last call, we restated our long-term margin target of 10% to 12%. We said, we thought we would make some improvement as 2021 went on and as we implemented prices and that continues to be true. We're inside that range and feel good moving forward that we will stay inside that range. I'm going to need a quick refresh on the second part. Okay. Well, I'll just hit on that real quick and then we will hopefully move on from the volume stuff. So we depleted our stored containers in -- at the -- during June of 2020, which largely created a lot of very fast fluidity for us, because we had gone into storage during the really weakened part of the second quarter last year. So during the third quarter demand was so strong? No, we didn't have equipment really positioned strongly. So that was back to the need to really reposition the equipment, which drove a lot of the velocity challenges that we certainly had a year ago. On the margin front, it's a range, because a lot of factors influence that. Certainly, can we achieve it? It really depends on some of the cost challenges, and at this point, there is not let up on challenges for recruiting and hiring and retaining drivers, there is no let up on the cost to outsource capacity, our need to secure capacity in order to dray loads out of the terminal. So all of those cost challenges are real, so we just got to stick within the, say that, it's going to be within the range and I think that's really all I can comment on the margin. So is there a concern of a meltdown, I think, that the railroads have all shown a fairly quick step in to slow volume down if heading towards that kind of a challenge. 2021 has been certainly an unusual year. So, but, no, I don't expect any kind of meltdown from the railroads. I do think that when we talk about labor challenges with the rail system, I mean, I really do think it's -- we're talking about locations that need to find 4% or 5% more employees in order to be fully staffed and overcome kind of a challenge that they're in now. These aren't just massive, massive amounts of people that they need to hire. So it feels like that would be highly unusual and I think all of the railroads are very focused on these challenges and they are out addressing them. And I don't feel like we're -- that some sort of a significant meltdown is a very significant risk at this point."

As we open our earnings call for the second quarter 2021, it makes sense to consider our comparison data with recognition for where we all were this time last year with the onset of the COVID virus. That said, we will continue our discussion on our views of our progress across the enterprise. A general term we believe fits our current position is momentum. We noted for you during our last call that we have meaningfully increased our equipment orders for containers in Intermodal and trailers for the J.B. Hunt 360box program. Through the quarter we gained confidence in these decisions and are working with our vendors to accommodate delivery of this equipment throughout the balance of the year with a keen focus on being able to meet the needs of our customers as we approach the traditional peak seasons. This is a fluid situation and we are deploying some new and creative ideas for ongoing equipment delivery. Shelley will add color for us on how we plan to work with our customers heading into the second half of 2021 and 2022. Allison, I don't -- we've been talking to our customer base about the impact it's had on our capacity for really several months and even into last year we've really been highlighting this challenge. I don't know that we had significant changes in the revenue cycle during the quarter as we've always talked about that. I think that when we've -- what we've been doing more recently with our customer base is trying to highlight and incentivize faster unloading. But that was probably towards the end of the second quarter, so beyond that I probably don't know how to highlight the impact of that during the second quarter. Yeah. I just don't think we can break out accessorial conversation as it relates to the margin. But no, I wouldn't say, that there was anything material in the quarter related to that. Sure. Just to start and I think Shelley might join with a comment or two. But we definitely anticipated that seasonal margin pressure. We highlighted that in our Q1 call and so we were not surprised by the second quarter performance with respect to where we landed. And I think that, historically, the second quarter was always the more pressured gross margin quarter that we experienced. So we would anticipate seeing lift as we move into Q3 and Q4 away from that based on historical norms. Shelley... ... on the bid data? All right. Well, based on our pipeline, we think that, well, you saw Q2 was very strong. We think Q3 will be strong as well and it's hard to tell on Q4. We got -- make sure we got equipment. We got to make sure we got drivers. So, there's just a lot of unknowns that far out. I will say that the pipeline is full, but there is a lot of things that go into metering how fast we can start those up, drivers, equipment and even some on the management side. So, but I would say Q3 is looking very strong as well. Yeah. Ken, let me have Darren respond to that. I think he'll have a better look at it. I'd just add to that, Nick, on your first part of your question, you use the term or we have good agility and I think that that's very well represented in the pivot that we've made in our strategy in JBT moving more towards an asset-light. And I think that that's facilitated the growth that we've experienced over the last several quarters that we've been talking about records since 2007 and 2008 by going to that asset-light model and tapping into the carrier base that we've had access to via ICS. And so 360 platform has certainly enabled us to be more flexible for our customers and be able to do more for them in that environment is just another good example of that. Yeah. Thanks, Brian. A lot inside of that question. Yeah. We're definitely satisfied with the progress that we've made. Appreciate you gravitating towards our three critical areas of our people, our technology and scale. I think that that has been demonstrated over the last several quarters and as we continue to grow on the scale, we've gotten back to profitability, which we've talked about for the last eight quarters that investment window. Investments will continue on. Obviously, with the work that we're doing with Google and the co-innovation that will come from that will allow us to make good decisions around how we continue to invest to enhance 360 platform and how we can make sure that we're providing value for our customers and for carriers. I think it's clear that our goals are to create the most efficient transportation network in North America and we feel real good about where we sit with respect to that. I would say that, the things that are most important to our customer is really cost, service and capacity, and our investments continue to focus around visibility, transparency and access, and that's where we'll continue to make decisions on how we move forward. Shelley, I don't know if you want to add anything to that."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. \nBrad Delco: Good afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

For information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I would like to introduce the speakers on today\u2019s call. This afternoon I am joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, our Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services; and Darren Field, President of Intermodal. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad. As we discussed during our last call, we entered 2021 with a cautious, but informed positive outlook on what we could expect in terms of demand and inventory replenishment needs from our customers. Aside from the temporary disruptions presented by weather events in February, most of the data supports are generally optimistic view of those expectations and encourages our direction going forward. As we evaluate current market conditions and the needs of our customers, we have determined that an increase in our capital investment plan is warranted. Accordingly, we are announcing a 40% increase in our originally stated plans to enable the procurement of incremental containers, trailers, and the needed supporting equipment such as chassis and tractors for JBI. The new projection for our capital investments now reached $1.25 billion for this year, a clear milestone for our company. We have secured contracts to increase our container fleet by another 6,000 units in 2021 for Intermodal, bringing our net addition target to approximately 12,000 units for 2021, a little over a 1,000 of which are temperature controlled containers. \nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019d like to start by providing a couple of comments on our first quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Given the weather and other constraints, facing the industry, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for this quarter, with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue as both ICS and JBT were up significantly over the prior-year quarter. With respect to weather, we previously guided to a $15 million to $20 million estimated operating income impact from the February winter storms. In closing the quarter, we determined this impact to be approximately $17 million, which primarily includes lost opportunities within our Intermodal segment of approximately 25,000 loads. Other cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers and higher costs across our various networks and operations due to congestion and the overall labor tightness from increased freight demand and capacity constraints. You will know, we ended the quarter with approximately $550 million in cash, with this being driven in part by our review of the capital investments that John had highlighted. We had previously guided CapEx to be between $850 million and $900 million for 2021 and we are now updating that to $1.25 billion, primarily driven by the Intermodal container adds and the trailers for our 360box program.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market conditions and our expectations for the year, as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our 360 platform. As John alluded to earlier, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities presented to us. These opportunities include a means to recover from the cost incurred last year as we honored our commitments to customers, but equally as important the opportunities to solve capacity challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Those capacity challenges for our customers remain very present in the current landscape and will likely persist throughout 2021 highlighted by a tight labor market, elevated cost to procure capacity, and overall lack of supply chain fluidity.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley. Good afternoon. I am going to spend a few minutes today giving out several areas and topics including the current driver environment, the results and performance of Dedicated with some additional context for the updated margin target range that John mentioned earlier, and finally, I\u2019ll review the results and performance of our Final Mile Services segment. I\u2019ll start with some quick thoughts and comments around the driver market. In my opinion, the industry is facing the most challenged driver market that I\u2019ve seen in my 37-year career at J.B. Hunt. We estimate that the decrease of the driving school applicants and graduates, the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse and the impact presented by the pandemic combined have resulted in approximately 220,000 fewer drivers available to meet industry capacity needs. As a result, we are taking a comprehensive approach to attract and retain our professional driving workforce, including adjustments to our wages and benefits while also focusing on the quality of the job. We believe we have some of the best wages for professional drivers \u2013 professional driving jobs in industry across our portfolio of services, including Intermodal dray, Dedicated, Truck and Final Mile Services. Over 90% of our driving jobs are local and regional providing consistent routes and opportunities for more home time. On Dedicated results. Dedicated continues to perform and respond in an agile fashion to the challenges thrown at it. Despite several weather-related disruptions in the quarter, DCS delivered its highest first quarter revenue and operating income in our company\u2019s history. I believe that it is a testament to our operations team and professional drivers who responded and worked to recover for our customers, all while staying focused on safe execution and the efficient utilization of our assets. As a result, customers continue to see value in the quality and flexibility of our professional outsourced private fleet solution as also evidenced by our strong pipeline. We ended the first quarter selling approximately 380 trucks in DCS as we are off to a strong start in 2021, all while customer retention rates remain above 98%. Regarding everyone\u2019s favorite topic about margin, we believe it is prudent to update the market on our targeted margin range, which now stands at 12% to 14% for the DCS segment from the previous range of 11% to 13%. Informing us of this decision is the following: Our value proposition, scale, efficiency, as well as the capital intensity of our business. More importantly it is worth noting that nothing in our pricing model has changed, but rather what it has revealed itself is the realization that the current scale of our operations presents us an opportunity to grow the business, while experiencing less drag and start-up cost associated with customer growth. Said it different way, we see the same opportunity presented to us today to balance our desire to grow well into the future while maintaining discipline around our returns on capital. I\u2019ll wrap up my comments on Final Mile Services. Final Mile Services was able to deliver a strong performance in the quarter as the continuation of fourth quarter peak season like strength in our business rolled into Q1, which has not been the seasonal norm. While weather did disrupt the business temporarily, we were able to recover and get our customers\u2019 goods delivered and only experienced a modest impact to overall performance and results. We remain active in conversations to grow and scale with our current and new customers across our footprint and plan to capitalize on these opportunities throughout the year. Additionally, we will continue to invest to ensure we deliver a differentiated product focused on the high standards of service, safety, and customer satisfaction. With regards to margins, we are maintaining our targeted range of 4% to 8%. Our growth trajectory of our asset and non-asset Final Mile Services offerings will continue to influence where we fall within that range as we gain greater scale with our value-added services. That concludes my remarks. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Nick. The organization\u2019s excitement and enthusiasm for our Highway Services business continues to be evidenced by the progress in our results and further supported by the opportunities our customers present us with to provide needed capacity solutions. My comments today will briefly touch on some of the highlights of our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions or APS and Truck or JBT. In short, the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 continues to provide our customers capacity solutions utilizing a combination of our multimodal digital freight platform, while complemented with our drop trailer pools powered by J.B. Hunt 360. I\u2019ll start with ICS. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $525 million or 56% growth over the prior year and deliver operating income of $7 million, which is now the second consecutive quarter of profitability since our journey along our digital transformation. Similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, the quarter presented us with opportunities to help customer\u2019s source capacity effectively and efficiently on our platform in an otherwise constrained market environment. Segment volumes were down 1% year-over-year driven by a decline of LTL volumes, offset, however, by truckload volumes, which were up 10% in the quarter. Higher spot market opportunities, higher contractual rates, and the previously-mentioned mix change contributed to the 58% increase in gross revenue per load. Going forward, we will remain focused on balancing the right mix of volume growth opportunities presented to us as we remain committed to our investments in three key areas, our people, our technology, and scaling the platform. As John alluded to earlier, our margin target remains 4% to 6% in this segment, which we believe is achievable as we move beyond our heavy investment cycle, achieve scale, and as the business model matures. In JBT or Truck, the segment was able to deliver 43% year-over-year growth in first quarter revenue following just shy of $150 million. Operating income was $10 million, which is the highest for a first quarter since 2007. Growth in this segment continues to be driven by non-asset and asset light service offerings powered and supported by the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by either J.B. Hunt own equipment or independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360box offering. Demand for this service is strong and supports the previously disclosed 100% increase to our prior trailer fleet investment for 2021. Our margin targets in JBT are now 8% to 10% from the prior 8% to 12%, which recognizes the shift to a more asset-light model. That said and similar to Final Mile Services, our performance relative to those targets will be dependent on the asset, intensity of the business as it evolves, but as always our returns on capital remain the core focus of our investments to grow this business. In closing, I would just like to reiterate the excitement and growth opportunities we see across our Highway Services portfolio to solve for our customers\u2019 needs in an efficient, and as Shelley alluded to earlier, more frictionless way. We remain committed to our investments and our people, technology and scaling the platform, which includes our investments to expand our 360box program. That concludes my comments and I\u2019ll pass it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Brad. Hello to everyone. Today, I will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance, give you some thoughts about network fluidity and balance, provide some perspective on the demand and pricing environment and cap it off with comments on our updated capital investment and target margin range that John highlighted earlier. Volumes declined 3% in the quarter, broken down by month, plus 3% in January, a 16% decline in February, and plus 4% in March. As we called out in the earnings release, the weather challenges in the quarter are estimated to have impacted us by 25,000 Intermodal loads primarily in February, but the effects did carry over into March. The rail network has shown signs of improvement so far in April although we are not fully back to pre-weather service levels we have and continue to expect to see improvements as we move through the second quarter. While rail challenges are well known, another challenge we face is what we refer to as customer street time, which has increased as our customers are falling behind on unloading inbound delivered units in a timely manner. We believe both the rail terminal congestion and the customer unloading challenges are direct results of labor challenges. Inside our operation driver hiring continues to be a significant challenge and the industry will take on higher wages in order to attract and retain new drivers. We fully expect the same is true for the rail terminal contractors and customer warehouse labor. Demand for our Intermodal service remains at incredibly strong levels. The pricing market is performing at a level to cover our cost increases from last year as we honored our commitments, as well as the inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing this year related to driver hiring. Certainly the increasing driver wage and rail costs are topics with our customers, but we are also highlighting the velocity challenges and the cost of equipment ownership. As you should be able to conclude, the pricing environment supports our decision to add additional capacity to our fleet as John highlighted earlier and as we discussed last quarter. During the last call, we said we expected pricing to come in at high-single to low double-digit increases. And at this point, we feel more optimistic about things trending towards the higher end of that range adjusting for mix. As we entered the quarter, just over 10% of our business had implemented 2021 bid cycle rates. By the end of the quarter just over 40% of the volume had current bid cycle rates. We will expect that to climb to 70% by the end of Q2 and the remainder to finalize during Q3. As John covered in his opening comments, we have adjusted the margin target range to 10% to 12%. We have highlighted many times that we remain focused on generating the appropriate return on our invested capital in the business and while margins are an output of achieving our targeted returns, returns are also influenced by other factors, including asset turns, capital intensity, and consideration of contribution per load.  We believe this new target range strikes the right balance between generating appropriate returns that support reinvestment to capitalize on what we believe is a long sustainable growth opportunity presented by the market. The future of Intermodal remains bright as it provides an economically attractive alternative to some of the challenges our industry is facing, including the driver market, higher fuel cost capacity, the carbon intensity of the supply chain and the need for investment in public infrastructure. Also as John highlighted, we have expanded our container order in 2021 to approximately 12,000 new containers, including both dry and temp-controlled that will begin to arrive in Q2 and continues through the end of the year. As we have moved through the current bid cycle, it is clear that our customers want more capacity from us and we are responding. The commitments from our customers thus far during bid season fully support this additional investment in capacity. We are confident that focusing and delivering value to our customers will support the appropriate returns needed to invest to meet their needs and put us on a strong path toward long sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments.\nOperator:  While we compile the Q&A roster, I will turn the floor over to Brad Delco.\nBrad Delco: Yeah, thank you. And just \u2013 we presented a lot to you guys there. We know our prepared comments went long, so we are going to cut you off with one question, just this one quarter. So, appreciate you guys following those instructions.\nOperator: And you first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good afternoon. So, I just wanted to see how we could think through the ROIC on Intermodal, I mean obviously you talked about the lower margin target, which you alluded to on Q4, but it sounds like what you are saying is that, the returns on invested capital are not going to change the shelf, maybe if you could help us think through that? And then, you know just maybe more broadly, you know, you moved the business towards or moving the business towards a more asset light model and just curious on your thoughts or expectations for longer-term consolidated ROIC? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Well, let me first touch on Intermodal Allison, appreciate the question. At the end of the day, at times in the past, we know it's been a while since we ran in the 11 to 13. At times in the past, since that time, our revenue per load has increased substantially 2018. And again, this year, prices are increasing pretty rapidly. So have cost, leaving us at a profitability level on a per load basis that is still similar to even better than it used to be when we were in the 11 to 13 range, which translates to returns on invested capital in Intermodal, even at a slightly weaker margin that are still as good as they used to be. And that's really what's driving some of that conversation. And I'll let Kuhlow probably speak to more on the enterprise side. \nJohn Kuhlow: So, I, you know, Allison, we look at really ROI see from \u2013 we manage it from a consolidated basis. And so we obviously have investments in the individual segments, different times, for example, we announced the increase in the container order, that's a huge capital investment in the current year. But we look at that overall investment over the 20 year life with us. And so we manage the balance of the segments on a consolidated basis. And those are going to increase and decrease just depending on the level of investment that we have at that time.\nOperator: Thank you and your next question comes from a line of Chris with - Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to stay on Intermodal if I could and ask about the 12,000 containers. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, when you look at the market today, I think you said your customers want more capacity from you. Can you talk a little bit about these containers and sort of how well they're already spoken for? And I think taking maybe into account just sort of the core demand that's in the market, but also maybe the sort of under utilization that's been caused by this congestion? So, I guess in other words, how long do you think it takes to deploy those sort of actively in the market or do you think this actually creates a little bit more supply relative to what demand is today?\nJohn Roberts: So, I would say our customer demand is significant. And the 6,000 containers we plan to order when we announced that in the fourth quarter earnings call back in January. And the current velocity environment just wasn't given us as much capacity as our customers clearly wanted from us. I'm not of the opinion that adding these containers puts an oversupply in any way into the market. I still believe that the market will be under supported with capacity based on velocity in some challenges there. We've made this decision knowing that we could fully utilize those containers that we announced, we've expanded the order on.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from a line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Question for Brad Hicks, and maybe Shelley. You know, six months ago, you guys expected ICS to turn a profit in the back half of 2021. Then you went on and did a nice profit and 4Q 2020, said you expected profitability in second half 2021, did an even better profit in 1Q 2021. So the question is, are we looking at still achieving the scale that you were hoping to attain in the second half of 2021? And if that's the case, is there an even greater step change in the profitability and the gross margin potential of this business, especially when you layer in this collaboration that you're hoping to achieve with Google?\nBrad Hicks: Good afternoon, Jon. I'll take a stab and maybe send it over to Shelly to add any other further comments. You know, we may have been too cautious when we spoke at the end of Q4 about what the first part of this year held. We're still are in heavy investment window as we clarified, I think eight quarters ago. But the market conditions really are very favorable as we think about revenue quality, and our overall ability to get the rate at a level that accounts for the increase in PTE that we have seen. The revenue per load levels are amongst the highest we've seen in our history, but also too is PTE. And so, the combination of those two with where we're at in our platform development, which we feel very encouraged by, as we turn into Q2 is very favorable for us. And so, you know, did that allow us to get further ahead than we had anticipated? Certainly the outcome and output of Q1 would reinforce that to it to some degree. But we still have work to do. We still have heavy investments, but we are at a place that we are very satisfied with on our journey. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: So to add, we are still very focused on scaling our business. When we started our bid season really across all of our segments, our customer alignment on cost and capacity was it necessarily reflective in the feedback we were getting, versus what the competitive market looked like. So, if you look at what happened in first quarter, we moved a disproportionate amount of spot shipments versus what we had historically moved and published volumes were lower than we expected at the beginning of the first quarter. As we have progressed through that quarter, and even moving here into April, we have seen our customers lean into us significantly, and really giving us larger bid awards, across our segments, and particularly inside highway. So, we'd say our beat in Q1 was a more reverse environment, more spot price in general. And as we move into Q2, I think that there will be seasonal margin pressure, and in particular, having published pricing that should be more on an annual basis. But having said that, more specific to the work that we are working on with Google in our alliance, we still are very focused on our co-innovation together to solve industry challenges focused primarily right now on transparency and visibility. We do think that that will help connect to our bottom line, which is why Brad reaffirmed our margin targets. In ICS, we are encouraged with our results. We are laser focused on getting to scale, very critical to have a great platform to create that most efficient transportation network in North America.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from a line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just a clarification on the margin targets. I mean it looks like you guys are obviously in  and also a little bit in DCS, kind of keeping your margin targets flat to slightly down as a trade off for higher top line growth, which seems like a very, very reasonable approach. But what level of revenue growth roughly are you underwriting to get to those margin targets?\nBrad Hicks: Hey Ravi, this is Brad. You know, we don't typically give guidance, but you know, in terms of other things we've said publicly, particularly around Intermodal, you know, we believe we should be over a long period of time growing at a faster rate than the market. And the reason for that is because we feel like we have some advantages. And so that's kind of what we've talked about in Intermodal. And then with dedicated I think Nick's provided comments about what we target to sell each year, but we're not going to give you specific revenue growth targets. We've obviously worked hard to get you guys more transparency on what we feel like is the right margin target range that generates the appropriate returns on our capital, and allows us to continue to grow well into the future as the market presents us those opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, afternoon, guys. So, you guys have been at a \u2013 call it a 10% Intermodal margin the last three years. As the rates reset higher, do you think you'll be closer to that 12% margin on an annualized basis? And then this 1.25 billion of CapEx should we think about this as a one-off or a new normal?\nDarren Field: Scott, this is Darren. I'll take the margin question. You know, we just don't \u2013 we've given you a long-term target. And so to say we expect anything, we expect to land inside that target and that's certainly our goal. And that's what we come into work every day and focus on.\nJohn Kuhlow: Hey, Scott, this is John. From a CapEx standpoint, we've obviously elevated this, there was a little bit of a carryover from last year that we paused, it\u2019s going through the pandemic and there might be a little bit of pull forward. But this I wouldn't use this as a run rate specifically, it's elevated from, a little bit from where our normal run rate will be going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Hi, I'm just sort of curious on the Final Mile business, which was pretty strong from a profit standpoint. Maybe give some thoughts around that. And specifically, the pace has been really strong. And obviously, there's a lot of trends, fitting that and just sort of curious, you know, how long do you think we could extend that outlook? I mean, would you say it's going to be fairly robust this year and beyond in the Final Mile ? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah, I would just , I would say that we saw a lot of fourth quarter pushing into Q1, because of the supply chain disruption. And so that trade forward, won't normally very slow, and are at least profitable. But really, we got a big boost. And it was almost like Q4 and Q1. And so we expect everything to go back to normal in Final Mile Q2, Q3 and we'll hit our target range is what we think would be for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line and Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nTom Wadewitz: Yeah. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Intermodal contract rates, and I guess you could talk about contract rates overall, if you want. You know, clearly point to some strength, is this, it seems like a big step-up after the February weather impact. Should we be thinking about potentially 15% contract rates or are you saying instead of kind of 9 or 10, we ought to be thinking about like 11. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of a large step-up in the expectation for contract rates would be?\nJohn Roberts: Well, Tom, I appreciate the attempt. You know, we highlighted high-single to low-double, and we reiterated in earlier comments that we're feeling more confident about the higher end of that. As outside of that statement, I really don't think it's, I don't even know enough yet to say anything beyond that. So, I don't know how to guide you to anything beyond double-digits.\nJohn Kuhlow: Tom we\u2019ll update you, if we think it goes triple digits. How about that?\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from a line of Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and congrats on the quarter. On intermodal margins, I know, John, you called out $17 million weather impact on a consolidated basis. I was wondering if you could quantify what the impact was in intermodal to \u2013 and if you could share what intermodal margins would have looked like ex-weather? And then thinking about the longer-term Intermodal margin guidance, can you go into a little bit more detail on what that assumes for the progression of rail service versus where we are today?\nJohn Roberts: Yeah, sorry, Justin, I can \u2013 as far as the weather impacts on Intermodal, we really look at it from a load standpoint. You know, what we said was the 25,000 loads. To translate that into margin, it takes a lot of speculation, calculating snow removal, insurance and claims. And so what we have good insight is the impact on the loads and the volumes. And I think that's the best way. I don't know how to translate that into what would margins have looked like had we not had the weather ban. There's just too many subjective things in there. And I apologize, I forgot your second part of the question.\nJohn Kuhlow: I'll probably take that one. I think he was asking, do we, you know, how much does it play into our ability in the new margin range to get either an improvement or in rail service or the expectation that it will remain somewhat stuck or slower or challenged velocity? I think more than anything, we have probably some belief that rail velocity has slowed down since the days of our 11 to 13 margins, and I'm not \u2013 I'm not ready to tell you that I have an expectation that it's going to get back to those levels. Do I think that rail velocity will improve in 2021 and beyond? I do. I mean, I think that has a lot to do with this labor supply challenge that we've highlighted many times and I don't think the railroads are \u2013 they're impacted by that as well, particularly at the terminal level. So, I would expect some improvement, which can help us, but I don't know that I can see rail velocity, getting back to the levels that was, you know, two or three years ago.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good afternoon. If we can just talk a little bit about the congestion and tightness, maybe your thoughts on how long this lasts, given the low inventories and the benefits of the tightness that you're seeing now versus then contrasting that with the fear of over ordering equipment. So, as congestion clears, do you see in the near term and you're stuck with some excess equipment or impacting rates?\nDarren Field: Yeah. I think from Intermodal\u2019s perspective, you know, there is such a strong demand for Intermodal services for highway conversion in the eastern part of the country that isn't necessarily attached to congestion at ports or particularly difficult congestion along the West Coast. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to grow Intermodal, will there be a blips in quarter somewhere? I guess that's possible. But I think we feel very good about the long-term projection of the equipment adds that's frankly why we did it.\nJohn Roberts: I would just add to that Darren, you know, we see congestion also on the highway services side, predominantly with our box program, and not so much from a rail congestion or port congestion, but in terms of our customers unload behavior. And so those labor challenges that Darren mentioned that we can see the impacts at ports and ramps, we also see on the customer behavior side. And so, we're paying very close attention to that. We would hope and expect to see a lift from where we are at today. And we really saw that deteriorate, beginning to middle of COVID last year. And so you know that that equipment velocity and availability is being negatively impacted by our customer\u2019s ability to unload the equipment. And we're working very closely with them to try and solve for that.\nShelley Simpson: And I would say maybe just from a customer view as well, inventory, I think will continue to be an issue and will persist through the second half of this year. I think that is newer news, and particularly what's happening on the Import side really trying to replenish if you just see how consumers are spending that is continuing from 2020. I would say, the challenges that we're experiencing, whether it's at the port or the rail, and in particular the labor side for professional drivers, that is a major issue that is very different this time that will take us more time to work through and we are very focused with our customers on cross selling and coming up with better peak planning. We do have across all services, good line of sight as to how we'll help our customers be right and have a successful peak season, whether that's in Q2, or happening in the back half of the year, I feel really confident about the work we're doing together.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from a line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to see in terms of the ICS and 360, you announced the Google Alliance, you announced another partnership with KeepTruckin, where do you feel like you are in terms of partnerships as you're trying to build out skill in the network? And clearly you're benefiting from a bit of spot market strength, as you mentioned, but how far do you think you are from really getting to scale? What sort of measures should we look for? And how are you tracking against them?\nShelley Simpson: Well, thank you for that, Brian. We are \u2013 have three key areas that we\u2019re focused on in J.B. Hunt 360, really access transparency and visibility. And that directly relates for our customer and costs, service and capacity. We do have multiple, as you call them partnerships across each one of those as our strategy and our work continues. We don't announce every piece of that because we don't see the advantage in the market to openly discuss that. But we do have specific work that is happening inside that. From a skill perspective, we will continue to work on removing friction. We want to make it simple for a shipper or a carrier to be able to connect quickly and efficiently and so any of the connections that we can make, and leverage other people's expertise, and really bring that or solve for that through J.B. Hunt 360, we will review and implement. So, I would say our scale, our ability to scale, we'll be continuing to solve for our customers number one from a full scale, or from a full scroll perspective, but also making sure that we highlight the technology so that they can get access to the right mode, the right truck at the right time. Pricing then will be reflective and transparency. And then ultimately, customers want to be able to track their shipments the same way we track a Domino\u2019s Pizza from the time we call it in to the time it gets to our home. And that's what we're focused on.\nJohn Roberts: I would just add to that, Shelley that from an execution standpoint, as we establish those key partnerships, we're constantly focused on how it can improve productivity and efficiency so that we can provide for our customers that cost benefit, that service benefit, that visibility benefit. And so we pay very close attention to the internal aspect of those capabilities as we move on down the road as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hey, Darren, just wondering if you can give us some color on those 12,000 new boxes, specifically, when it's coming, where it's going? My guess is it's mostly earmarked for the East, but if you can just talk about that, and also just related to that, one thing that, you know, I'm trying to understand is, how the KPIs and the business and the Intermodal business kind of evolve as that new capacity comes online, it's obviously a lot of capacity 12% new capacity.  I assume it's good for growth, because of the improvement in turns and maybe dilutive to length of haul and yield, maybe even slightly dilutive to margins, but not dilutive to ROIC. I'm just trying to think through that. So, if you can just talk about, there's probably like five questions in there. But you know, when it's coming, where it's going, and how does the KPIs kind of evolve as that new capacity comes online?\nDarren Field: Sure. So, you know, we announced 6,000 earlier in our fourth quarter earnings call, and today we're updating that up to 12. There are some temp control equipment in there. Roughly a 1,000 temp control boxes that will come in that have been in our plan for some time, and so those will all flow into the West Coast. Now the dry box is the logistics plan to get those boxes into our system continues to evolve. In some ways, we're securing capacity to bring that equipment predominantly to the West Coast, and predominantly to Southern California, so that it enters our market at the right time.  Those boxes begin to deliver during Q2, and really are spread throughout the rest of the year with and there's probably a little bit extra during Q3, where you'll be you'll be receiving a little bit heavier flow of that equipment in to help us for peak season. Certainly for the longer-term life of that equipment, we would expect it to be diversified into the Eastern network, but in 2021, it's really going to help us a lot out west for sure.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to turn back to Final Mile, can you talk a little bit about your contract structure with local carriers in terms of your visibility into cost inflation and, you know, you talked about your long-term margin target and reiterated it 4 to 8, a couple of years ago, you talked kind of 2 to 4 in the early stages. Are we sustainably based on how you see this business trending in that longer-term range at this point? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah, thank you for the question. I think we are trending that way. From what we're seeing with contract rates, they are going up with our contractors. The market is very tight, particularly with the amount of background checks we do for security, safety protocols. We try to hold ourselves to the highest standard and in our contract is that way to the cost will go up. Or we're able to pass that along to our customers. They're not structured yet the way dedicated contracts are. But we have very good relationships with our customers with the top performing metrics on service all the way around.  So, we think we'll be able to go back to our customers if the market demands it to get there. So yes, I think we're in the right market range. You\u2019re going to see us, our work to improve the margins. And we've done some of that with REITs with existing customers. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward. So, we feel comfortable with the 4 to 8 more volume there.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from a line of Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good evening. Just for clarification, you know, with the margin targets, what you're laying out and what you're updating is really, is it fair to say, is this the normalized range? And that's how you're pricing business? And should we think about that there could be cyclical factors where you could be above or below those ranges for a period of time? And then secondly, it certainly feels like with ICS and dedicated you can be in those ranges, but in the other segments, are there any investments or changes that you need to make to be within those margin ranges, you know, within a near term basis?\nNick Hobbs: I'll just say, I'll start with dedicated first. And we feel very comfortable. We're not changing our pricing model as we said in our comments. We think we got to the scale now. With the growth that we're seeing this year, we've had a very good Q1. We've signed 380 trucks already. And we're off to a really good start. Just last week, we signed 133 trucks. So, we think that we've got the scale that we're going to be able to absorb that without impacting our margins. And then also, we just have the density of the marketplace. We got 360 marketplace to help us be more efficient. Again, we saw our productivity as well increased very nicely, this quarter. And all that's about efficiency and density that really allows us to work on that margin, without increasing our cost to our customers.\nJohn Kuhlow: I'll add to that, Nick, from a highway services perspective. You know, we did adjust slightly our truck targets, but mostly just a pure reflection, as John alluded to of a movement towards more of an asset light position where we're growing our box program without having to make the historical heavy investment of the tractor. And so that really just helped us kind of shore up where we think that will be. We are still on that journey, our box initiative, really just launched less than 18 months ago. And as we've also stated, today, we've increased the investment for incremental boxes just this year. And so, you know, we're tracking along per our expectations, and we see the ability to get back to that expectation. Switching gears over to ICS, similarly, we're at the end of our heavy investment period. But again, characteristics, productivity gains, the advantages that we're seeing and capitalizing on because of the platform, where we're able to just be more efficient, and make better decisions. And really eliminate ways.  We see those things that reinforce the affirmation of the range that John reiterated. And so, those are the things that drove us, but again, I think it's important for all of our . Fundamentally, it's about return on invested capital for us. And if things change in the model, you know, whether that be a further movement to asset light in our truck model, then that could influence things down the road. But at this point, those are the targets that we think are extremely realistic and achievable. \nJohn Kuhlow: I'll just quickly on Intermodal, certainly I would expect that, you know, we're kind of through that noisy period of time, what related to arbitration and underlying real cost, we have what we feel like is a very good understanding of that role in our cost, and felt like this margin adjustment was appropriate, as well as sustainable for growth. Do I think there is the opportunity to live at the high-end of it? I guess at times, that's certainly possible. You know, I don't know how to predict that, but I certainly would expect to be within that zone is certainly a sustainable plan for us to continue to grow Intermodal.\nShelley Simpson: I would just add maybe to wrap-up as an organization. I think the cyclicality will come when we have underestimated or missed our cost basis for our customers. We will continue to honor our commitments and anytime we've made a commitment to a customer based on a fixed price in that assumption changes up or down, you could see us move in the margin target range and even outside of that either direction that over the longer-term, we think that those margin targets are appropriate based on what we know today and based on our growth plan with our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, operator. And good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Shelley, can I follow up with you here on ICS volumes, because I do think it was down about 1% this quarter, you know, you did get a lot of price, obviously, we're profitable again, which is better than expectations. But is there anything to read through on market share of competitiveness? You know, because I think it's scale, and number of transactions that you really want to get towards the back half of the year. So, can you talk to whether or not that was a setback this quarter?\nShelley Simpson: Yeah, great question. So, our overall includes what's happening. From an LTL perspective, we really have a key customer that we have been overcoming that comp. Inside our LTL sector, we're starting to see growth, particularly in our 360 platforms. So, feel confident about our plan around the LTL side. In general, if you just looked at truckload volumes, particularly in ICS, those volumes were at a 10% growth plan. But I did talk about this earlier in this call that the very first part of bid season, although we had been educating and talking through what we believed the cost base would be to serve our customers in all of our services that didn't directly align to the competitive pressure we were feeling from our customers in bid season. I will say, we held our ground on price, in really all of our segments overall. And as our customers implemented those bids in first quarter, many of those bids were not working, they were falling apart, because the price was not commensurate to the cost that the carriers and the brokers were giving to customers. So, as we progress through first quarter, we started picking up volume, again, very much in-line with what our strategy was as an organization, in total, and have a lot of confidence in our scaling and gaining more market share in Q2 and beyond, not just in ICS, but also in JBT. Remember, the platform is not just an ICS product, it is across our entire enterprise, how we can leverage that for our customers to really allow them to have the right cost service and capacity. We saw scaling inside JBT as well in the first quarter and we will continue to gain and take market share in both JBT and ICS from a 360 platform and then certainly in the Intermodal space as well.\nBrad Delco: Hey, , we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And your last question comes from a line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me in here. Just a question for you on the contour of the Intermodal volume trends in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about what the exit rate was in March and how we should be thinking about the build over the COVID disruption volumes that we saw in 2Q last year?\nJohn Roberts: Well, so certainly, we highlighted earlier that, you know, February was just very difficult as you're all aware of weather related impacts, and that that did bleed into the first part of March. We did highlight that March overall grew at 4%, but remember, last year, March probably had a little bit of COVID impact. There was some disruption in Intermodal at that time. So to say that volumes in March reached pre-weather disruption levels, you know, we were continuing to work hard to rebuild the network, get the capacity in all the markets where it needs to be, and get back on a better velocity front with our container equipment.\nBrad Hicks: Hey, David, this is Brad. The only thing I'll follow up with, you know, we did provide and Darren did provide monthly, so monthly, March was up 4%. That's probably the best data point we can give you in terms of what the expectation should be in 2Q. You know, all I just remind you, we did start to feel COVID late last March and then comps do get a little easier. But we're not going to try to predict what our volumes will look like in Q2 because there's a lot different variables that will ultimately play into how we perform.\nBrad Delco: I think John, you're going to close this out.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. I'll close this out. I'll start with a thanks to everybody for joining us today. I'll say that I am extremely proud of this team of leaders here that not only navigated us through a very challenging 2020, but hit the ground as we can see running hard in the first quarter. I'm also very proud of this organization for hearing our customers need and presenting discussion that was very consumable. These are big changes for us to make this early in the year. But please rest assure that there's been a lot of modeling, a lot of debating and a lot of conviction to making investments like these, to better serve our customers.  That's why we're here. And it's what we do. And I love it when we hear that, and lean in and invest. I'd like to reiterate this driver availability challenge again. I think it's a meaningful part of our mid-term and potentially long-term future. And I think we'll be hearing and discussing more and more about that. And then the last thing, just love seeing the results from years ago are prioritizing the need to invest in technology to bring the company forward. And really, I think, at this point, the industry forward. I think 360, as Shelley just said, is a very comprehensive approach. It started out as, you know, kind of a migration from legacy to what could it be to, you know, what you're seeing and hearing today, and we have a really good hope in that effort and investment going forward. So, I hope this call has provided some clarity on the questions around margin. We spent a lot of time talking about that as appropriate. Hopefully brought that to close now and we can continue to give you helpful updates. Thanks for the time today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Nick. The organization's excitement and enthusiasm for our Highway Services business continues to be evidenced by the progress in our results and further supported by the opportunities our customers present us with to provide needed capacity solutions. My comments today will briefly touch on some of the highlights of our Highway Services businesses, which includes both Integrated Capacity Solutions or APS and Truck or JBT. In short, the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 continues to provide our customers capacity solutions utilizing a combination of our multimodal digital freight platform, while complemented with our drop trailer pools powered by J.B. Hunt 360. I'll start with ICS. ICS was able to deliver revenue of $525 million or 56% growth over the prior year and deliver operating income of $7 million, which is now the second consecutive quarter of profitability since our journey along our digital transformation. Similar to the fourth quarter of 2020, the quarter presented us with opportunities to help customer's source capacity effectively and efficiently on our platform in an otherwise constrained market environment. Segment volumes were down 1% year-over-year driven by a decline of LTL volumes, offset, however, by truckload volumes, which were up 10% in the quarter. Higher spot market opportunities, higher contractual rates, and the previously-mentioned mix change contributed to the 58% increase in gross revenue per load. Going forward, we will remain focused on balancing the right mix of volume growth opportunities presented to us as we remain committed to our investments in three key areas, our people, our technology, and scaling the platform. As John alluded to earlier, our margin target remains 4% to 6% in this segment, which we believe is achievable as we move beyond our heavy investment cycle, achieve scale, and as the business model matures. In JBT or Truck, the segment was able to deliver 43% year-over-year growth in first quarter revenue following just shy of $150 million. Operating income was $10 million, which is the highest for a first quarter since 2007. Growth in this segment continues to be driven by non-asset and asset light service offerings powered and supported by the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. As JBT has shifted to more of an asset-light model, we have an ability to provide trailing capacity to customers that may be hauled by either J.B. Hunt own equipment or independent contractors or power-only capacity sourced through the platform. This is our 360box offering. Demand for this service is strong and supports the previously disclosed 100% increase to our prior trailer fleet investment for 2021. Our margin targets in JBT are now 8% to 10% from the prior 8% to 12%, which recognizes the shift to a more asset-light model. That said and similar to Final Mile Services, our performance relative to those targets will be dependent on the asset, intensity of the business as it evolves, but as always our returns on capital remain the core focus of our investments to grow this business. In closing, I would just like to reiterate the excitement and growth opportunities we see across our Highway Services portfolio to solve for our customers' needs in an efficient, and as Shelley alluded to earlier, more frictionless way. We remain committed to our investments and our people, technology and scaling the platform, which includes our investments to expand our 360box program. That concludes my comments and I'll pass it over to Darren. Good afternoon, Jon. I'll take a stab and maybe send it over to Shelly to add any other further comments. You know, we may have been too cautious when we spoke at the end of Q4 about what the first part of this year held. We're still are in heavy investment window as we clarified, I think eight quarters ago. But the market conditions really are very favorable as we think about revenue quality, and our overall ability to get the rate at a level that accounts for the increase in PTE that we have seen. The revenue per load levels are amongst the highest we've seen in our history, but also too is PTE. And so, the combination of those two with where we're at in our platform development, which we feel very encouraged by, as we turn into Q2 is very favorable for us. And so, you know, did that allow us to get further ahead than we had anticipated? Certainly the outcome and output of Q1 would reinforce that to it to some degree. But we still have work to do. We still have heavy investments, but we are at a place that we are very satisfied with on our journey. Shelley? Hey Ravi, this is Brad. You know, we don't typically give guidance, but you know, in terms of other things we've said publicly, particularly around Intermodal, you know, we believe we should be over a long period of time growing at a faster rate than the market. And the reason for that is because we feel like we have some advantages. And so that's kind of what we've talked about in Intermodal. And then with dedicated I think Nick's provided comments about what we target to sell each year, but we're not going to give you specific revenue growth targets. We've obviously worked hard to get you guys more transparency on what we feel like is the right margin target range that generates the appropriate returns on our capital, and allows us to continue to grow well into the future as the market presents us those opportunities. Hey, David, this is Brad. The only thing I'll follow up with, you know, we did provide and Darren did provide monthly, so monthly, March was up 4%. That's probably the best data point we can give you in terms of what the expectation should be in 2Q. You know, all I just remind you, we did start to feel COVID late last March and then comps do get a little easier. But we're not going to try to predict what our volumes will look like in Q2 because there's a lot different variables that will ultimately play into how we perform."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good afternoon everyone. I'd like to start by providing a couple of comments on our first quarter of 2021 from a consolidated perspective. Given the weather and other constraints, facing the industry, we are pleased with our revenue, operating income and EPS growth for this quarter, with notable achievements in our Highway Services revenue as both ICS and JBT were up significantly over the prior-year quarter. With respect to weather, we previously guided to a $15 million to $20 million estimated operating income impact from the February winter storms. In closing the quarter, we determined this impact to be approximately $17 million, which primarily includes lost opportunities within our Intermodal segment of approximately 25,000 loads. Other cost pressures in the quarter were primarily related to higher driver costs to attract and retain drivers and higher costs across our various networks and operations due to congestion and the overall labor tightness from increased freight demand and capacity constraints. You will know, we ended the quarter with approximately $550 million in cash, with this being driven in part by our review of the capital investments that John had highlighted. We had previously guided CapEx to be between $850 million and $900 million for 2021 and we are now updating that to $1.25 billion, primarily driven by the Intermodal container adds and the trailers for our 360box program. So, I, you know, Allison, we look at really ROI see from \u2013 we manage it from a consolidated basis. And so we obviously have investments in the individual segments, different times, for example, we announced the increase in the container order, that's a huge capital investment in the current year. But we look at that overall investment over the 20 year life with us. And so we manage the balance of the segments on a consolidated basis. And those are going to increase and decrease just depending on the level of investment that we have at that time. Hey, Scott, this is John. From a CapEx standpoint, we've obviously elevated this, there was a little bit of a carryover from last year that we paused, it's going through the pandemic and there might be a little bit of pull forward. But this I wouldn't use this as a run rate specifically, it's elevated from, a little bit from where our normal run rate will be going forward. Tom we'll update you, if we think it goes triple digits. How about that? I'll probably take that one. I think he was asking, do we, you know, how much does it play into our ability in the new margin range to get either an improvement or in rail service or the expectation that it will remain somewhat stuck or slower or challenged velocity? I think more than anything, we have probably some belief that rail velocity has slowed down since the days of our 11 to 13 margins, and I'm not \u2013 I'm not ready to tell you that I have an expectation that it's going to get back to those levels. Do I think that rail velocity will improve in 2021 and beyond? I do. I mean, I think that has a lot to do with this labor supply challenge that we've highlighted many times and I don't think the railroads are \u2013 they're impacted by that as well, particularly at the terminal level. So, I would expect some improvement, which can help us, but I don't know that I can see rail velocity, getting back to the levels that was, you know, two or three years ago. I'll add to that, Nick, from a highway services perspective. You know, we did adjust slightly our truck targets, but mostly just a pure reflection, as John alluded to of a movement towards more of an asset light position where we're growing our box program without having to make the historical heavy investment of the tractor. And so that really just helped us kind of shore up where we think that will be. We are still on that journey, our box initiative, really just launched less than 18 months ago.

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley. Good afternoon. I am going to spend a few minutes today giving out several areas and topics including the current driver environment, the results and performance of Dedicated with some additional context for the updated margin target range that John mentioned earlier, and finally, I'll review the results and performance of our Final Mile Services segment. I'll start with some quick thoughts and comments around the driver market. In my opinion, the industry is facing the most challenged driver market that I've seen in my 37-year career at J.B. Hunt. We estimate that the decrease of the driving school applicants and graduates, the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse and the impact presented by the pandemic combined have resulted in approximately 220,000 fewer drivers available to meet industry capacity needs. As a result, we are taking a comprehensive approach to attract and retain our professional driving workforce, including adjustments to our wages and benefits while also focusing on the quality of the job. We believe we have some of the best wages for professional drivers \u2013 professional driving jobs in industry across our portfolio of services, including Intermodal dray, Dedicated, Truck and Final Mile Services. Over 90% of our driving jobs are local and regional providing consistent routes and opportunities for more home time. On Dedicated results. Dedicated continues to perform and respond in an agile fashion to the challenges thrown at it. Despite several weather-related disruptions in the quarter, DCS delivered its highest first quarter revenue and operating income in our company's history. I believe that it is a testament to our operations team and professional drivers who responded and worked to recover for our customers, all while staying focused on safe execution and the efficient utilization of our assets. As a result, customers continue to see value in the quality and flexibility of our professional outsourced private fleet solution as also evidenced by our strong pipeline. We ended the first quarter selling approximately 380 trucks in DCS as we are off to a strong start in 2021, all while customer retention rates remain above 98%. Regarding everyone's favorite topic about margin, we believe it is prudent to update the market on our targeted margin range, which now stands at 12% to 14% for the DCS segment from the previous range of 11% to 13%. Informing us of this decision is the following: Our value proposition, scale, efficiency, as well as the capital intensity of our business. More importantly it is worth noting that nothing in our pricing model has changed, but rather what it has revealed itself is the realization that the current scale of our operations presents us an opportunity to grow the business, while experiencing less drag and start-up cost associated with customer growth. Said it different way, we see the same opportunity presented to us today to balance our desire to grow well into the future while maintaining discipline around our returns on capital. I'll wrap up my comments on Final Mile Services. Final Mile Services was able to deliver a strong performance in the quarter as the continuation of fourth quarter peak season like strength in our business rolled into Q1, which has not been the seasonal norm. While weather did disrupt the business temporarily, we were able to recover and get our customers' goods delivered and only experienced a modest impact to overall performance and results. We remain active in conversations to grow and scale with our current and new customers across our footprint and plan to capitalize on these opportunities throughout the year. Additionally, we will continue to invest to ensure we deliver a differentiated product focused on the high standards of service, safety, and customer satisfaction. With regards to margins, we are maintaining our targeted range of 4% to 8%. Our growth trajectory of our asset and non-asset Final Mile Services offerings will continue to influence where we fall within that range as we gain greater scale with our value-added services. That concludes my remarks. So I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. I'll just say, I'll start with dedicated first. And we feel very comfortable. We're not changing our pricing model as we said in our comments. We think we got to the scale now. With the growth that we're seeing this year, we've had a very good Q1. We've signed 380 trucks already. And we're off to a really good start. Just last week, we signed 133 trucks. So, we think that we've got the scale that we're going to be able to absorb that without impacting our margins. And then also, we just have the density of the marketplace. We got 360 marketplace to help us be more efficient. Again, we saw our productivity as well increased very nicely, this quarter. And all that's about efficiency and density that really allows us to work on that margin, without increasing our cost to our customers."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update this afternoon will focus on general market conditions and our expectations for the year, as well as an update on the progress we are making as an organization with our 360 platform. As John alluded to earlier, we entered 2021 with cautious optimism about the opportunities presented to us. These opportunities include a means to recover from the cost incurred last year as we honored our commitments to customers, but equally as important the opportunities to solve capacity challenges for and on behalf of our customers. Those capacity challenges for our customers remain very present in the current landscape and will likely persist throughout 2021 highlighted by a tight labor market, elevated cost to procure capacity, and overall lack of supply chain fluidity. So to add, we are still very focused on scaling our business. When we started our bid season really across all of our segments, our customer alignment on cost and capacity was it necessarily reflective in the feedback we were getting, versus what the competitive market looked like. So, if you look at what happened in first quarter, we moved a disproportionate amount of spot shipments versus what we had historically moved and published volumes were lower than we expected at the beginning of the first quarter. As we have progressed through that quarter, and even moving here into April, we have seen our customers lean into us significantly, and really giving us larger bid awards, across our segments, and particularly inside highway. So, we'd say our beat in Q1 was a more reverse environment, more spot price in general. And as we move into Q2, I think that there will be seasonal margin pressure, and in particular, having published pricing that should be more on an annual basis. But having said that, more specific to the work that we are working on with Google in our alliance, we still are very focused on our co-innovation together to solve industry challenges focused primarily right now on transparency and visibility. We do think that that will help connect to our bottom line, which is why Brad reaffirmed our margin targets. In ICS, we are encouraged with our results. We are laser focused on getting to scale, very critical to have a great platform to create that most efficient transportation network in North America. And I would say maybe just from a customer view as well, inventory, I think will continue to be an issue and will persist through the second half of this year. I think that is newer news, and particularly what's happening on the Import side really trying to replenish if you just see how consumers are spending that is continuing from 2020. I would say, the challenges that we're experiencing, whether it's at the port or the rail, and in particular the labor side for professional drivers, that is a major issue that is very different this time that will take us more time to work through and we are very focused with our customers on cross selling and coming up with better peak planning. We do have across all services, good line of sight as to how we'll help our customers be right and have a successful peak season, whether that's in Q2, or happening in the back half of the year, I feel really confident about the work we're doing together. Well, thank you for that, Brian. We are \u2013 have three key areas that we're focused on in J.B. Hunt 360, really access transparency and visibility. And that directly relates for our customer and costs, service and capacity. We do have multiple, as you call them partnerships across each one of those as our strategy and our work continues. We don't announce every piece of that because we don't see the advantage in the market to openly discuss that. But we do have specific work that is happening inside that. From a skill perspective, we will continue to work on removing friction. We want to make it simple for a shipper or a carrier to be able to connect quickly and efficiently and so any of the connections that we can make, and leverage other people's expertise, and really bring that or solve for that through J.B. Hunt 360, we will review and implement. So, I would say our scale, our ability to scale, we'll be continuing to solve for our customers number one from a full scale, or from a full scroll perspective, but also making sure that we highlight the technology so that they can get access to the right mode, the right truck at the right time. Pricing then will be reflective and transparency. And then ultimately, customers want to be able to track their shipments the same way we track a Domino's Pizza from the time we call it in to the time it gets to our home. And that's what we're focused on. I would just add maybe to wrap-up as an organization. I think the cyclicality will come when we have underestimated or missed our cost basis for our customers. We will continue to honor our commitments and anytime we've made a commitment to a customer based on a fixed price in that assumption changes up or down, you could see us move in the margin target range and even outside of that either direction that over the longer-term, we think that those margin targets are appropriate based on what we know today and based on our growth plan with our customers. Yeah, great question. So, our overall includes what's happening. From an LTL perspective, we really have a key customer that we have been overcoming that comp. Inside our LTL sector, we're starting to see growth, particularly in our 360 platforms. So, feel confident about our plan around the LTL side. In general, if you just looked at truckload volumes, particularly in ICS, those volumes were at a 10% growth plan. But I did talk about this earlier in this call that the very first part of bid season, although we had been educating and talking through what we believed the cost base would be to serve our customers in all of our services that didn't directly align to the competitive pressure we were feeling from our customers in bid season. I will say, we held our ground on price, in really all of our segments overall. And as our customers implemented those bids in first quarter, many of those bids were not working, they were falling apart, because the price was not commensurate to the cost that the carriers and the brokers were giving to customers. So, as we progress through first quarter, we started picking up volume, again, very much in-line with what our strategy was as an organization, in total, and have a lot of confidence in our scaling and gaining more market share in Q2 and beyond, not just in ICS, but also in JBT. Remember, the platform is not just an ICS product, it is across our entire enterprise, how we can leverage that for our customers to really allow them to have the right cost service and capacity. We saw scaling inside JBT as well in the first quarter and we will continue to gain and take market share in both JBT and ICS from a 360 platform and then certainly in the Intermodal space as well."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. Hello to everyone. Today, I will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance, give you some thoughts about network fluidity and balance, provide some perspective on the demand and pricing environment and cap it off with comments on our updated capital investment and target margin range that John highlighted earlier. Volumes declined 3% in the quarter, broken down by month, plus 3% in January, a 16% decline in February, and plus 4% in March. As we called out in the earnings release, the weather challenges in the quarter are estimated to have impacted us by 25,000 Intermodal loads primarily in February, but the effects did carry over into March. The rail network has shown signs of improvement so far in April although we are not fully back to pre-weather service levels we have and continue to expect to see improvements as we move through the second quarter. While rail challenges are well known, another challenge we face is what we refer to as customer street time, which has increased as our customers are falling behind on unloading inbound delivered units in a timely manner. We believe both the rail terminal congestion and the customer unloading challenges are direct results of labor challenges. Inside our operation driver hiring continues to be a significant challenge and the industry will take on higher wages in order to attract and retain new drivers. We fully expect the same is true for the rail terminal contractors and customer warehouse labor. Demand for our Intermodal service remains at incredibly strong levels. The pricing market is performing at a level to cover our cost increases from last year as we honored our commitments, as well as the inflationary cost pressures we are experiencing this year related to driver hiring. Certainly the increasing driver wage and rail costs are topics with our customers, but we are also highlighting the velocity challenges and the cost of equipment ownership. As you should be able to conclude, the pricing environment supports our decision to add additional capacity to our fleet as John highlighted earlier and as we discussed last quarter. During the last call, we said we expected pricing to come in at high-single to low double-digit increases. And at this point, we feel more optimistic about things trending towards the higher end of that range adjusting for mix. As we entered the quarter, just over 10% of our business had implemented 2021 bid cycle rates. By the end of the quarter just over 40% of the volume had current bid cycle rates. We will expect that to climb to 70% by the end of Q2 and the remainder to finalize during Q3. As John covered in his opening comments, we have adjusted the margin target range to 10% to 12%. We have highlighted many times that we remain focused on generating the appropriate return on our invested capital in the business and while margins are an output of achieving our targeted returns, returns are also influenced by other factors, including asset turns, capital intensity, and consideration of contribution per load.  We believe this new target range strikes the right balance between generating appropriate returns that support reinvestment to capitalize on what we believe is a long sustainable growth opportunity presented by the market. The future of Intermodal remains bright as it provides an economically attractive alternative to some of the challenges our industry is facing, including the driver market, higher fuel cost capacity, the carbon intensity of the supply chain and the need for investment in public infrastructure. Also as John highlighted, we have expanded our container order in 2021 to approximately 12,000 new containers, including both dry and temp-controlled that will begin to arrive in Q2 and continues through the end of the year. As we have moved through the current bid cycle, it is clear that our customers want more capacity from us and we are responding. The commitments from our customers thus far during bid season fully support this additional investment in capacity. We are confident that focusing and delivering value to our customers will support the appropriate returns needed to invest to meet their needs and put us on a strong path toward long sustainable growth. That concludes my prepared comments. Scott, this is Darren. I'll take the margin question. You know, we just don't \u2013 we've given you a long-term target. And so to say we expect anything, we expect to land inside that target and that's certainly our goal. And that's what we come into work every day and focus on. Yeah. I think from Intermodal's perspective, you know, there is such a strong demand for Intermodal services for highway conversion in the eastern part of the country that isn't necessarily attached to congestion at ports or particularly difficult congestion along the West Coast. We have a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to grow Intermodal, will there be a blips in quarter somewhere? I guess that's possible. But I think we feel very good about the long-term projection of the equipment adds that's frankly why we did it. Sure. So, you know, we announced 6,000 earlier in our fourth quarter earnings call, and today we're updating that up to 12. There are some temp control equipment in there. Roughly a 1,000 temp control boxes that will come in that have been in our plan for some time, and so those will all flow into the West Coast. Now the dry box is the logistics plan to get those boxes into our system continues to evolve. In some ways, we're securing capacity to bring that equipment predominantly to the West Coast, and predominantly to Southern California, so that it enters our market at the right time.  Those boxes begin to deliver during Q2, and really are spread throughout the rest of the year with and there's probably a little bit extra during Q3, where you'll be you'll be receiving a little bit heavier flow of that equipment in to help us for peak season. Certainly for the longer-term life of that equipment, we would expect it to be diversified into the Eastern network, but in 2021, it's really going to help us a lot out west for sure."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad. As we discussed during our last call, we entered 2021 with a cautious, but informed positive outlook on what we could expect in terms of demand and inventory replenishment needs from our customers. Aside from the temporary disruptions presented by weather events in February, most of the data supports are generally optimistic view of those expectations and encourages our direction going forward. As we evaluate current market conditions and the needs of our customers, we have determined that an increase in our capital investment plan is warranted. Accordingly, we are announcing a 40% increase in our originally stated plans to enable the procurement of incremental containers, trailers, and the needed supporting equipment such as chassis and tractors for JBI. The new projection for our capital investments now reached $1.25 billion for this year, a clear milestone for our company. We have secured contracts to increase our container fleet by another 6,000 units in 2021 for Intermodal, bringing our net addition target to approximately 12,000 units for 2021, a little over a 1,000 of which are temperature controlled containers. Well, let me first touch on Intermodal Allison, appreciate the question. At the end of the day, at times in the past, we know it's been a while since we ran in the 11 to 13. At times in the past, since that time, our revenue per load has increased substantially 2018. And again, this year, prices are increasing pretty rapidly. So have cost, leaving us at a profitability level on a per load basis that is still similar to even better than it used to be when we were in the 11 to 13 range, which translates to returns on invested capital in Intermodal, even at a slightly weaker margin that are still as good as they used to be. And that's really what's driving some of that conversation. And I'll let Kuhlow probably speak to more on the enterprise side. So, I would say our customer demand is significant. And the 6,000 containers we plan to order when we announced that in the fourth quarter earnings call back in January. And the current velocity environment just wasn't given us as much capacity as our customers clearly wanted from us. I'm not of the opinion that adding these containers puts an oversupply in any way into the market. I still believe that the market will be under supported with capacity based on velocity in some challenges there. We've made this decision knowing that we could fully utilize those containers that we announced, we've expanded the order on. Yeah, I would just , I would say that we saw a lot of fourth quarter pushing into Q1, because of the supply chain disruption. And so that trade forward, won't normally very slow, and are at least profitable. But really, we got a big boost. And it was almost like Q4 and Q1. And so we expect everything to go back to normal in Final Mile Q2, Q3 and we'll hit our target range is what we think would be for the year. Well, Tom, I appreciate the attempt. You know, we highlighted high-single to low-double, and we reiterated in earlier comments that we're feeling more confident about the higher end of that. As outside of that statement, I really don't think it's, I don't even know enough yet to say anything beyond that. So, I don't know how to guide you to anything beyond double-digits. Yeah, sorry, Justin, I can \u2013 as far as the weather impacts on Intermodal, we really look at it from a load standpoint. You know, what we said was the 25,000 loads. To translate that into margin, it takes a lot of speculation, calculating snow removal, insurance and claims. And so what we have good insight is the impact on the loads and the volumes. And I think that's the best way. I don't know how to translate that into what would margins have looked like had we not had the weather ban. There's just too many subjective things in there. And I apologize, I forgot your second part of the question. I would just add to that Darren, you know, we see congestion also on the highway services side, predominantly with our box program, and not so much from a rail congestion or port congestion, but in terms of our customers unload behavior. And so those labor challenges that Darren mentioned that we can see the impacts at ports and ramps, we also see on the customer behavior side. And so, we're paying very close attention to that. We would hope and expect to see a lift from where we are at today. And we really saw that deteriorate, beginning to middle of COVID last year. And so you know that that equipment velocity and availability is being negatively impacted by our customer's ability to unload the equipment. And we're working very closely with them to try and solve for that. I would just add to that, Shelley that from an execution standpoint, as we establish those key partnerships, we're constantly focused on how it can improve productivity and efficiency so that we can provide for our customers that cost benefit, that service benefit, that visibility benefit. And so we pay very close attention to the internal aspect of those capabilities as we move on down the road as well. Yeah, thank you for the question. I think we are trending that way. From what we're seeing with contract rates, they are going up with our contractors. The market is very tight, particularly with the amount of background checks we do for security, safety protocols. We try to hold ourselves to the highest standard and in our contract is that way to the cost will go up. Or we're able to pass that along to our customers. They're not structured yet the way dedicated contracts are. But we have very good relationships with our customers with the top performing metrics on service all the way around.  So, we think we'll be able to go back to our customers if the market demands it to get there. So yes, I think we're in the right market range. You're going to see us, our work to improve the margins. And we've done some of that with REITs with existing customers. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward. So, we feel comfortable with the 4 to 8 more volume there. Well, so certainly, we highlighted earlier that, you know, February was just very difficult as you're all aware of weather related impacts, and that that did bleed into the first part of March. We did highlight that March overall grew at 4%, but remember, last year, March probably had a little bit of COVID impact. There was some disruption in Intermodal at that time. So to say that volumes in March reached pre-weather disruption levels, you know, we were continuing to work hard to rebuild the network, get the capacity in all the markets where it needs to be, and get back on a better velocity front with our container equipment. Yeah. I'll close this out. I'll start with a thanks to everybody for joining us today. I'll say that I am extremely proud of this team of leaders here that not only navigated us through a very challenging 2020, but hit the ground as we can see running hard in the first quarter. I'm also very proud of this organization for hearing our customers need and presenting discussion that was very consumable. These are big changes for us to make this early in the year. But please rest assure that there's been a lot of modeling, a lot of debating and a lot of conviction to making investments like these, to better serve our customers.  That's why we're here. And it's what we do. And I love it when we hear that, and lean in and invest. I'd like to reiterate this driver availability challenge again. I think it's a meaningful part of our mid-term and potentially long-term future. And I think we'll be hearing and discussing more and more about that. And then the last thing, just love seeing the results from years ago are prioritizing the need to invest in technology to bring the company forward. And really, I think, at this point, the industry forward. I think 360, as Shelley just said, is a very comprehensive approach. It started out as, you know, kind of a migration from legacy to what could it be to, you know, what you're seeing and hearing today, and we have a really good hope in that effort and investment going forward. So, I hope this call has provided some clarity on the questions around margin. We spent a lot of time talking about that as appropriate. Hopefully brought that to close now and we can continue to give you helpful updates. Thanks for the time today and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand over to Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. The floor is yours. Please go ahead.\nBrad Delco: Good morning. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

For information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's annual report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This morning I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, Executive Vice President of People and President of Highway Services. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad, and good morning. My comments will be brief today as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business with more detail. As we reflect on the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2022, we have seen and experienced a cyclical shift in market dynamics that will present both challenges and opportunities as we navigate through the upcoming year. That said, we remain encouraged by trends from our real providers that present opportunities for faster transit times and in-turn greater service quality and value for our customers. We also see some loosening in the labor market and some modest improvements in equipment availability. Conversely, demand for transportation service in the fourth quarter was seasonally weak as customers manage through levels of elevated inventories. As we've discussed in the past, we have confidence in the collective and complementary nature of our distinct businesses that are built to be resilient and durable through market cycles. I have a tremendous amount of confidence in our people led by the 14 officers of our company that have a combined 340 years of experience here at J.B. Hunt. In closing, our team will remain disciplined and focused on charting our course to compound returns on the capital we've deployed to support our long-term growth for the benefit of our stakeholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good morning. My comments today will mirror many of the things I shared last quarter and will focus on our priorities for 2023 and beyond. If you recall, we discussed three priorities as an organization. First, to remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; second, to deliver exceptional value to our customers across our entire organization; and third, to deliver long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As we have discussed, the last two quarters and as John mentioned, we've seen a shift in our market dynamics, but our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. We believe first and foremost, that it starts with our people who are responsible for delivering exceptional value and service to our customers, who in-turn trust us to meet their growing transportation needs. We believe our suite of services across the J.B. Hunt scroll provides customers exceptional value from a company they have learned to trust over the many years and cycles. Our challenge for 2023 is to deliver exceptional value for and on behalf of customers in this market. In the past, we talked about what customers value from their trusted transportation providers, which is cost, service, and capacity. During the pandemic, customers value capacity most with less weight on cost and service. We see the shift occurring now where customers are putting more value on cost or how to save the money and on service quality as capacity is less difficult to source. We believe our suite of services can and will present our customers opportunities to save money with our industry leading intermodal franchise, highly engineered dedicated capacity, a scaled asset light highway services offering, and one of the largest Final Mile Services in North America.  In closing, I want to say that we're approaching 2023 with some caution around recent demand trends, but remain highly confident in our ability to thrive in any environment. We will focus on controlling what we can control, managing our business with a focus on long-term growth while remaining nimble. We will compete in the market to earn, reinforce, and gain our customers' trust, and their freight. We are excited about the many ways and opportunities we have to deliver value to our customers, which we believe will reveal itself over the course of 2023 and well into our future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will cover our recent performance in the quarter and for the fiscal year 2022. I will also provide you a preliminary view on our capital plan for 2023. Overall, results for the quarter were mixed. As freight volumes were pressured by unseasonably soft demand as compared to prior quarters of the year. That said, operating results were fairly resilient in spite of an unusual item that I'll touch on later. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter grew 4% year-over-year, but operating income declined 13% and GAAP earnings per share declined 16%. We incurred a rather large income statement item in the quarter for approximately $64 million or $0.46 per diluted share for an incremental pretax increase in casualty claims expense. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the second quarter of this year as certain claims from prior year incidents continue to settle at much larger amounts than what we have historically experienced. For the full fiscal year 2022 on a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue grew 22%, operating income grew 27%, and earnings per share grew 29% versus 2021. Based on the solid performance for the year, we voluntarily paid out an 8.8 million appreciation bonus in the fourth quarter to our frontline employees in recognition of their contribution to a fantastic and record year for our company. Of note, we paid a similar appreciation bonus a year ago, so the year-over-year impact was not significant, but worth calling out when looking at sequential performance. We continue to focus on and maintain a strong balance sheet providing us with ample liquidity to deploy capital to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital plan for 2023 contemplates between 1.5 billion and 2 billion of capital for business needs. This includes elevated levels of replacement demand as a result of equipment challenges experienced over the last two years; growth CapEx to support investments, primarily in JBI and DCS; and investments in real estate. Importantly to note, a large portion of our growth CapEx is success-driven based on our ability to secure long-term dedicated contracts. This growth component and the timing uncertainty is the reason for this range. Our capital allocation plan for 2023 also contemplates supporting our dividend consistent with our long-term practice, as well as taking advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares. We will continue to monitor and manage our leverage target to around 1x EBITDA, but are comfortable going above this level if investment opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remain strong as we sold approximately 330 trucks in the fourth quarter, which was greater than the trucks sold in the third quarter. This brought our full-year truck sales number to just over 2,000 trucks, which compares to our stated target range of 1,000 to 1,200 per year. Our backlog also remains strong with more opportunities in the pipeline today versus the same time a year ago, but we have seen some moderation in the breadth of the backlog. Our net truck adds in the quarter declined 187 units as compared to the third quarter, largely as a result of us making progress on our equipment trades as new equipment availability improved, but also because some of our downsizing of fleets to match our customers' business levels. As we've discussed before through our CVD process or Customer Value Delivery, we optimize and re optimize our fleets to present value savings opportunities for our customers. This ultimately supports our 98% retention rate of our customers, as well as supports future growth opportunities with these same customers. Going forward, we will remain confident in our ability to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of this business as we deliver superior value for our customers with our highly engineered outsourced solution. Shifting to Final Mile. We remain focused on improving profitability in this business by working through contracts and making sure we are fairly compensated for the value we deliver, achieving the appropriate level of profitability will support further investment needed to meet the growing needs of our customers and the [actually growing] [ph] segment of the market. We will continue to be disciplined on our commitments and remain willing to put business at risk to achieve the appropriate levels of profitability, which could ultimately influence our top line performance in the segment. Demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment has moderated some as the headlines might suggest, but we have seen strength in our fulfillment business with off price retailers seeing lots of opportunities with discounted inventory in the channel. Closing with some general comments on operations. Similar to my update last quarter, we continue to see improvements in areas around professional driver recruitment and retention, but at elevated cost. We are a touch more optimistic about equipment availability in 2023, largely as a result of bringing in a third OEM into our mix, but maintenance cost remains elevated across the company. We remain focused on our safety performance, but are doubling down on strategic initiatives across the company to improve performance in this area given the elevated cost the industry is experiencing. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and talk about our opportunity to deliver exceptional value and capacity to our customers in 2023 and beyond. I'll start by reviewing the performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was seasonally weaker than normal as PCs and activity leading up to the holidays was absent this year. Volumes for the quarter declined 1% year-over-year and by month were up 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 5% in December. We experienced improvements in rail velocity in the quarter and also saw some modest improvements in customer detention of equipment on a sequential basis. That said, we still believe we can see further progress on both fronts, which will further improve velocity and decrease transit times in our system. We believe that current trends around velocity present opportunities for us to sell a higher valued and reliable service product in the market. As we think about 2023, we see a lot of opportunities to deliver value to our customers with our industry leading Intermodal service product. As Shelley discussed, customers have shifted their focus more on costs and service versus capacity. We believe our intermodal service product presents our customers with opportunities to save money by converting highway freight back to intermodal, which reduces their costs and is further supported by fuel cost and carbon emissions savings, while [import volumes] [ph] have been weak, we still see opportunities to gain customers wallet share by converting highway freight and transloading more international freight into our domestic containers.  Additionally, we are in the best position to commit more intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress through the current bid season based on solid improvement in rail service levels and our investment to expand our capacity. Finally, because I anticipate this being a question, I thought I'd address it here. As you are aware, we have more capacity and better alignment with our Western Rail provider, BNSF, and we have both committed to the long-term growth of our collective intermodal service offering. We will compete in the market on the basis of cost capacity and service and we feel confident in our ability to earn our customers' business and grow our wallet share. We are not approaching 2023 with a volume versus price mentality, but how do we set-up our business to drive the greatest shareholder value over the long-term. This was my eloquent way of saying, we historically have not given any guidance on price, volume or margins and we will continue that streak, but also the streak of managing our business to compounding our growth and returns over the long-term. That concludes my prepared remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360 and how we continue to see the platform bringing together our scroll, but specifically Highway Solutions to drive value for and on-behalf of our customers, whether with or without a drop trailer solution. I'll start off with ICS. ICS top line revenue was down 33% comprised of a 27% decline in volume and a 9% decline in revenue per load. Our truckload volume in the quarter was down 21%. Transactional or spot truckload volume was down year-over-year, but contractual volume was up slightly year-over-year. We experienced additional pressure on our transactional and contractual business in the fourth quarter as demand and volume were unusually soft during what is normally considered peak season. Maybe said differently, there was no peak and demand was actually weaker in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, which is atypical. As we've discussed in the past, our goal remains to leverage our platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. Despite the poor performance on our top line, which did influence our profitability, we do remain in our people and our platform J.B. Hunt 360 to deliver exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders over the long-term. Shifting to truckload, while the freight environment was challenging in the quarter, we continue see evidence of demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better relative to the overall market, which we believe was demonstrated in the quarter. Volume in JBT increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. We believe customers continue to see value in the blending of their live and drop trailer capacity needs that we can provide by leveraging our platform powered by J.B. Hunt 360. As we move into 2023, we will remain focused on leveraging our investments and our people, technology, and capacity to further scale the business. We see a long runway of opportunity for future growth in 360box supported by disciplined investments, solid execution, and earning appropriate return on our capital. Wrapping up on J.B. Hunt 360, I wanted to take the last minute here to make sure the investment community understands that our digital freight marketplace is a tool that drives value across our entire enterprise. For example, it allows us to source third party intermodal dray capacity. It provides us backhaul freight opportunities in DCS, and allows us to prop-up a startup fleet as we hire drivers or source equipment. I believe more obvious, you see the results in ICS and JBT as we are able to run non-asset or an asset-light business leveraging our data and systems to provide almost unlimited capacity for and on-behalf of our customers. ICS and JBT collectively is our highway solution for our customers, representing the largest segment of the North American transportation market. Whether the customer needs drop trailers that historically could only be provided by large asset truckload carriers or a [spot load] [ph] and a live load, live unload network, we are one solution on one system backed by the J.B. Hunt brand. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thanks Brad. And operator, in the interest of the number of people we have in queue. Can we do just one question per caller? Thanks, Elliot.\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe a question for you, Darren. I know you don't want to talk a lot about sort of the pricing volume outlook for intermodal, but maybe I could ask the question this way as you, [sitting here] [ph] in the beginning of the year and as you noted, you have a different setup with your major rail partner in the West, wanted to get a sense of sort of what customer receptivity has been to that increased capacity and the opportunity to potentially convert loads back onto the intermodal network? I guess maybe the, sort of finer point on that as you think about, sort of the historical relationship with intermodal versus, sort of say macro or truckload, do you think that 2023 can be a year of relative outperformance for intermodal just given some of the macro stuff that we're seeing right now?\nDarren Field: Sure, Chris. Appreciate the question. I think universally our customers are positive towards re-converting highway business that should be intermodal. I think they are appropriately cautious in saying, hey, J.B. Hunt and BNSF, I need you to prove it to me that you're going to get your service and velocity quality back. And I think we're aligned like we continue to say every quarter more than ever with BNSF on that mission. I have talked to my team at length four months now about rebuilding confidence in our customers. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and intermodal is a way for them to save money. And as velocity improves, it even helps in inventory carrying costs. And so, there's a lot of opportunities for us to continue to talk about growing intermodal and certainly, I don't know of a customer telling us, I'm not interested in converting business to intermodal. I think across the board, our customer base is very receptive, but I do want to at least acknowledge there's a bit of a lag in that process and I think we are busy proving to the customers that the service quality of velocity has improved and will continue to improve as the year goes on. \nChris Wetherbee: And just one point of clarification, just the BNSF for rail service where it needs to be to make that value proposition to the customer?\nDarren Field: Yeah, I would say, it's early, but so far in January, our rail service is the best it's been since the first quarter of 2020. And so, that's a really positive sign. We're not quite to where we want to be fully, but there is massive improvement in the rail service today.\nChris Wetherbee: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We now turn to Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Darren, sticking with you, obviously, you're investing on your own in your own capacity, but there's no, kind of commentary on box turns. How you get into what you just said about service being the best since 1Q 2020, can you give us an update on where box turn stand today? Where do you think it\u2019ll be in the next kind of 3 to 6 months? And probably more importantly, outside of your own investments, just when the box turns the velocity, the productivity, the fluidity is alone, how much capacity you think that adds to your network over the next 12 months?\nDarren Field: Yes. So, it's a topic for us daily. Our box turns in the fourth quarter were 1.44, nowhere near where we expect them to be. The realities are, we're in a bit of transition period when velocity, customer unloading, a host of challenges, created weakness in our turn ratio. As we come out of that scenario and get back into a more normalized velocity process, gain productivity with our dray fleet, look for productivity in the container fleet, we have lots and lots of capacity to grow into. That's an opportunity for us. I mean in the fourth quarter, in the second half of the year, we're extremely confident in our ability to serve our customers' needs as there will be a return to a peak season shipping. I don't have a number to give you in terms of how many containers come out of the improvement in velocity.  What I would say is, we're probably on a long march and I'm not sure we can accomplish it in 2023, but we anticipate getting back to a turn ratio in the [175 to 180] [ph] in the future. And that will be very direct effort on our part and we'll be cautious with our container purchases, but we have to keep that supply chain open and moving and we need to be onboarding equipment at least some, but we'll be looking to grow our volumes as fast as we can for sure.\nOperator: We now turn to Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, stick with intermodal. So, you guys have more containers parked in 4Q than I think we've ever seen in a Q4 and it sounds like you're expecting box turns to improve. So, I guess why aren't you dialing back on some of the container adds for this year? And then Darren, I know you don't want to give specific guidance, but maybe just directionally, do you think you're going to grow intermodal volume this year? And how do you think about overall revenue segment earnings? Do you think positive negative just directionally any thoughts? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Well, I appreciate your attempts, Scott, to get me to give guidance. We're not going to be able to do that. Certainly, I do expect intermodal to grow this year on all fronts, on revenue, on earnings, certainly on volume. I think that as we come out of the first quarter, there is a lag. You can see it in the import economy. I mean, there is a significant lag in demand at the moment. Most of our customers, if not all, are optimistic about summer and the rest of the year. There's an inventory correction going on. We have real opportunities to grow our intermodal business and we're working on that every day. Certainly, we're not going to ignore the fact that right now the market is soft in Q1 and inventory is trying to correct. As far as boxes, we really haven't made any announcement about how much equipment we're onboarding this year. What I would say is, it's more than zero, but certainly we're going to meter back a little bit over where we have been as velocity has really, really brought a lot of capacity to our market.\nOperator: We now turn to Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Good morning. I'll shift to a question on dedicated. So, Nick, maybe you could talk about how much of a headwind you saw in the fourth quarter from fleets reducing the size of their fleets? And then looking into 2023, we've got some moving pieces with new business you've won, but also cyclical pressure, how are you thinking about a reasonable target for both gross fleet additions and net fleet additions this year?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. So, as we look back at Q4, we felt some pressure, I would say, modest, not a lot, but there were some accounts that were given early signals of reduction and we did reduce just a handful of fleets at this point. The primary thing I would say that we addressed was really we've been carrying a lot of older trucks and so we're starting to pick up a few more new trucks and making some headway in reducing that. So, that was the primary, but there was some fleet reduction. Then we're going to stick with our guidance on what we've said on sales in the 800 to 1,000 range. Our pipeline is still full. We feel good. We are experiencing what I would call just some hesitation from deals that are in there that the customers trying to figure out what's going to happen in the first part of the year, but we are still signing deals.  So, we, yes, 1,000 to 1,200 correction, not 800 to 1,000, so 1,000 to 1,200 that we would sell. Also, we have 500 trucks already sold that we will be adding as we get the equipment available. So, we have some momentum on that side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Darren, I just wanted to ask about how do you think cost can trend in the intermodal business as yield continue to moderate? I'm just trying to understand if you think there's enough cost and efficiency opportunity to offset more pressure on the revenue side from yield? And then John Kuhlow, I just wanted to ask about 8.8 million bonus payment. That's great to see for the whole team. Just wondering if you can talk about, is it pro-rata across segments or is there one segment that's taking the lion's share of that? Thanks.\nDarren Field: So, I'll start Amit. Appreciate the question. I think that we have long said that there's real cost to exit our system in the form of velocity and improvements in driver productivity. Box turns gets most of the focus because it's an easy metric to see and calculate. Our driver productivity is a significant element inside our cost that can also improve as we grow our volumes and get more normalized into our system. Our customers are beginning to unload our equipment faster. The railroads are operating faster, all of which creates some cost takeout. So, as we grow our business, we really feel strongly that we can overcome any, kind of pricing pressure. We're not looking for any, kind of change to our long-term margin guidance and feel confident that we can deliver in that area in 2023 for sure. We said, we expected to grow volume, expect to grow revenue and expect to grow earnings in 2023. Kuhlow?\nJohn Kuhlow: Hey, Amit. It feels like a second question, but it's a good topic, so we'll grant it to you. On the appreciation bonus, that was for all frontline employees. That's predominantly drivers, but also includes technicians and then some of our office. So, it's primarily in the JBI and the dedicated segments. That's where we have most of our drivers. I'll give you of the [8.8, 3 million] [ph] was in Intermodal and Dedicated was another 5 million and the rest is spread throughout the other segments.\nOperator: We'll now turn to Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe an ICS question. I think you guys were very clear in the 3Q to 4Q walk not playing out as expected because of the lack of peak season. How do we think about that going to 2023? What's the [4Q to 1Q] [ph] walk looking like? Is that demand weakness continuing or do you not see as much of a step down sequentially into 1Q?\nDarren Field: Yes. Good morning and thank you for the question. I started to talk about that pivot at the end of Q3 and we certainly saw that play out. And in my prepared comments, I used the word atypical. We certainly saw that throughout the fourth quarter, a continued weakening from October into December. As we sit here right now just through 15, 16 days in January. I would say, we're consistent with what we saw end of December. However, as Darren mentioned, we do expect sometime maybe second quarter going into third quarter with inventory resets. We would fully expect to see the freight market rebound, but I do feel like this is the area of our company that will most feel the volatility we've long discussed and documented what happened in the spot market and that still sits about where it was. And so, until we see some of that freight demand rebound imports start flowing, I think we'll be in a comparable environment to what we saw in the fourth quarter in brokerage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Shelley, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on some of the caution you're seeing on the demand side and we've touched on it a little bit, but it seems like the general view is that you expect a tough first quarter and then some improvements, sort of towards the middle part of the year.  So, Darren, does that give you enough confidence from the demand side and also from the service side, both from the West and the East to really lean in and commit that capacity that you think your customers are going to be there and waiting for? Because it does seem like the timing of the recovery on the service side and demand is going to be a key factor here. So, curious on your thoughts there. Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: Good morning, Brian. We did use the theme word and we have through the whole pandemic and that was being fluid, with our customers and just helping them understand where they're at and where we're at from a transportation perspective. We also talked a lot about being cautious in the last discussion. And I think those were some of the demand trends we were starting to see. If you look in the fourth quarter, you saw port activity continue to decline all the way into December. And certainly, we're feeling the impact from that. As we have talked to customers, they have shared with us that there is an inventory correction happening that you've heard both Brad and Darren talk about. And that's really we expect to continue to occur all through the first quarter. We have had good signals from our customers about Q2 starting up back to a more normalized or having a more normal environment. We're not sure at what point that is in Q2, but we do feel like the back half of the year, we have confidence from what our customers are giving us and the data points that they have, what they're going to be doing from an ordering perspective. The freight recession that we see right now is largely inventory driven. We don't see anything else from our customers in total. And then last thing I would say, Brian, if you think about bid season for our company in the one-way part of the business, so this should be all of intermodal and all of highway services. Those really occur in the back half of the year fully loaded. So, if you think about a July 1, if you will, that's really when bid season is complete and we know the results of what's happening in bid season. And that's what really drives what we're going to do from a capital planning. So, you heard Darren say, we're going to be fluid in that part of the process. We have flexibility so that we know how much equipment we can onboard, but I would say, we feel confident in our bid season strategy, our ability to win highway share converted to intermodal and then continuing to grow inside our highway services. And you heard Nick talk about our confidence around dedicated and what our customers are saying there. And I would add, I feel confident about what's happening in the Final Mile space as well.\nDarren Field: I just want to jump in, Brian. You asked a little bit of \u2013 you hinted at Eastern rail providers, and in both Eastern railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX are also performing better than they have in 2022 and we're confident in their plans and continue to see really significant opportunities in that part of our network to grow highway share conversion back to intermodal as this year goes on.\nOperator: We now turn to Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. I wanted to ask you a bit about just beyond supply chain, if you think that there's going to be improvement in fluidity, I mean, it sounds like you're seeing that. Do you think that that happens fairly quickly? And how does that impact the storage revenues? Is that something we should see storage revenues go down a lot in 2023 or do you think it's more, kind of a gradual thing that there's a bit of stickiness in what happens with storage revenues? And I'm thinking in particular storage, container storage revenues in intermodal? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Sure. I'll take that. I mean, do I think that fluidity in the supply chain will get better with weaker demand and allow the system to kind of reset itself? Absolutely. We're experiencing that today. Our customers are better set up for their supply chains and the port infrastructure is accommodating imports today. And so system is moving more fluidly. As that relates to storage revenues, the only way to answer that is it depends. As long as our customers are unloading faster, then there will be a decline in those revenue streams, but that frees up capacity to operate more shipments on that container every month and that's our focus today.  That's why you'll continue to hear us talk about real cost can come out of our system that can translate into savings for our customers, which just allows us to provide value faster and grow our intermodal business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, morning. I was wondering if you could give us some little more color on this casualty claim expense, sort of the nature of it. I mean, is this like a one-time cleanup through the various business segments or is this \u2013 how do we think about, sort of a run rate on an ongoing basis? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow : Yeah, Jordan, this is John Kuhlow. I'll address that. We've seen similar to others in the industry over the last 12 months to 18 months a dramatic change in our settlement experience on our claims. All of our claims, but most importantly, our more severe claims are settling at much higher levels than our historical experience. Sometimes to 5x to 10x what they were five years ago. And so, our insurance coverage consists of layers and there are certain layers in there that have caps. And when we exceed those caps, the claims expense reverts to us. And the 30 million that we recorded in the second quarter and the 64 million that recorded in the fourth quarter for a total of 94 million in the current year represents our reserve adjustments on previously incurred claims. So, these are all prior period claims that we've increased our reserves based on our experience. With that, I will tell you that the reason why we've done this is because our insurance claims costs for the claims experience is dramatically going up. And it's a highly unpredictable environment. We are not planning in 2023 for another one-time charge. But as I said, it's highly unpredictable and we're continuing to watch our claims. Now, I will tell you that we have made some changes to our structure going into 2023. And so, we are going to be taking on more coverage and to contemplate this. And I'll go even a little bit deeper than we normally do just because this is a significant area that we're focused on. I think on a rate basis, our premiums are going to be up around 15% just on the core premiums. But as I mentioned, we're adding in new layers of insurance and so our premium base will also increase.  That said, we're expecting our incurred losses to increase as much as 30% to 35% in the next year because of what we're seeing on these, just the movement today on how these claims are being settled. So, a little bit more insight than we would normally give, but wanted to give you a little bit deeper information on what we're seeing in the insurance area.\nOperator: We now turn to Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning and thanks for the question. Darren, I think you spoke a couple of times about earnings growth in Intermodal this year, can you just reconcile that with tougher pricing in the truckload market and how that dynamic could impact your yield generation this year? [Now looking] [ph] for specific items there either.\nDarren Field: Well, I mean at the end of the day, we understand pricing pressure out there. Customers want to save money, but again, there is real cost to come out of our system and there's real efficiency for us to gain with growth. And so, as we grow our intermodal business, there is the opportunity to continue to do more loads with the assets that we have. It may not translate into the same income per shipment, but if we're executing more shipments as we move forward and find a way to drive some cost out, then we're going to be able to grow our income really strongly as we grow volume. And that's the mission, is to get out as this bid season goes and as we're out communicating and displaying to our customers that velocity has improved and the intermodal service product has really improved a ton and can get closer in transit to what truck transit is. We feel like we can really grow our business significantly, which will turn into income growth as the year goes on.\nOperator: We now turn to Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. Just want to get back to dedicating, I think this is probably applicable to the Final Mile as well. On the maintenance cost side, new equipment coming in, maybe less consumer demand need, should we think of that accelerating down pretty quickly this year or is it the customer needs are going to keep some of that aging equipment still in service? Just any kind of thoughts there.\nJohn Kuhlow : Yes. Well, it kind of goes through all fleets, Intermodal, Dedicated and Final Mile. Talking to our OEMs, they're still going to be constrained, they think this year. And so, we've publicly announced that we're going to a third OEM that will help us alleviate some of those constraints, but based on our forecast, we will still be handling a few hundred trucks that are past due at the end of this year that could move forward if the OEMs numbers come up. But we will have some trades that we're going to carry with us the most part of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Shelley, just can we revisit some of the comments there on bid season? I think you noted that bid season was fully loaded by July 1. So, are we still looking at a March through May industry bid season for part of the business? And if it is then coming up, I guess Brad and Darren, you've each talked about maybe fourth quarter demand weakness and outlook into the New Year. Maybe can you talk about how you're thinking about where contract stands versus spot levels?\nShelley Simpson: Hey, good morning Ken. I would say our customers in general are going to be implementing between now and July 1. We still have a smaller portion of our business that we'll implement from July 1 all the way through the end of the year, but the bulk of the business, we tend to look at our business in that July 1 through the next year as how we think about revenue quality, our growth plans. Although we budget for a full-year at the calendar year, we actually review what's happened from a bid season at mid-year. And I would say our customers are largely in-line. We do have a few customers that might have changed some of their bids start, but for the most part, they're in-line with what we've historically seen, and I'll let Darren and Brad comment if there's anything else there.\nDarren Field: Well, I'm going to ask Brad to comment on the spot versus [Multiple Speakers].\nBrad Hicks: Ken, I'll make a few comments here. We're still very early in bid season, but our strategy is clearly focused on winning contracted business. The spot market and what we've seen in that over the last several months and we can't necessarily count on when or if that may return or if and when it does, does it get back to what it used to be? Is it something less? And so, we are optimistic about our early feedback in bids and what we're seeing there, meeting our expectations in terms of volume growth of contracted business. So, from a \u2013 on the transactional side, on highway, that's our predominant focus. I think in years past, we will move around the percentages of what's published versus spot and I would anticipate us being on the highest end of that from a contract standpoint versus spot in highway. Intermodal certainly a little different. They don't play the spot market nearly as much. And so, I'll let maybe Darren comment what he's seen.\nDarren Field: Well, I think Intermodal contract prices should continue to provide in most corridors a significant saving against highway contract rates, fuel inclusive. And that's been the case forever and there'll be no difference this year. Certainly, there's a handful of markets out there where I think truck spot prices may be applying some pressure at the customer level around their mix of highway and intermodal and we'll watch that and we'll try to adapt and we'll talk to our rail providers and look for ways to take cost out of our systems so that we can be competitive, but at the same time, we're going to be disciplined about our returns and our margin profiles and everything about our business that has been the case forever at J.B. Hunt.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. I think this has been touched on a couple of different ways throughout the call, but maybe just bringing it together. How do we think about the shape of the quarters and earnings as we move through 2023? It seems like that the volume environment is going to start-off weak in first quarter, but there's an expectation for some inflection mid-year, but at the same time, contract pricing is going to come in. So, how do we think about seasonality? And then if the demand environment doesn't inflect up, what are some of the cost levers that you have that can offset weaker demand? Thanks.\nBrad Delco: Hey, Todd. It's Brad Delco. You hit the fortunate pleasure of me responding to that question. One, we don't provide guidance, but I think maybe one general statement I would say and we've talked about this before, we haven't really seen seasonality over the better part of the last two or three years just based on elevated demand levels that we've seen. Clearly seasonality is come back in to play. You saw that in the fourth quarter. In fact, I think Brad Hicks\u2019 comments and Darren\u2019s comments suggested that we actually saw atypical seasonality where fourth quarter was overall from a demand perspective weaker than Q3. I'd also just say, I think you heard there probably isn't a lot of expectations from the demand environment changing much at least in terms of what visibility we have here in first quarter. What happens after that, we really \u2013 we don't have any crystal ball than anybody else. So, I think giving you any more detail on guidance and how the year plays out would probably not be in our best interest.\nOperator: We now turn to Ari Rosa from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Rosa: Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask, John Kuhlow mentioned that you guys might be willing to take up leverage for the right opportunities. I just wanted to press a little bit more on that comment and understand if that was a reference to M&A or if it was a reference to something else and if it was a reference to M&A, what are the types of opportunities that you would be thinking about that would justify that, sort of taking up of leverage?\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes, there wasn't anything in specifically that I was referring to. It was just more commenting on the strength of our balance sheet, our liquidity position, and the ability to take advantage of opportunities that exist. We still continue to look at buyback or excuse me, at M&A as it becomes available we'll continue to do so. But buybacks and dividends are also a core piece of our capital allocation process and we'll evaluate that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: As you went through the competitive bids with Schneider leaving your rail partner and moving over to the [UP] [ph], can you tell us what you learned about your customers desire to perhaps stay with the BN versus create some competitive or maintain some competitive tension in their intermodal suppliers and how that's inflecting your strategy long-term to grow the business? Thanks.\nDarren Field: So, I don't know that we have enough details yet to really have a strong position on that. We universally hear from our customers that they want to maintain a significant share on BNSF. They have confidence in our ability to talk them through the service improvements and our ability to provide the capacity that Schneider has taken with them. So, I think there's no doubt out of our customer base that we have the capacity to backfill anything Schneider was operating on BMSF. It's also not the top of mind topic when we're talking to our customers, the first subject is not, hey, can you take on Schneider's business? Our process is to go into a customer and talk about their network and look for solutions with intermodal where it's the right solution regardless of who the competitor might be handling that business. So, we're just out trying to solve for our customers and we think they have real confidence in us. I think that the Schneider exit means a ton in the way we talk to BNSF, how we collaborate together, how we're talking about operations in the terminals, how we're going to market together. So, the Schneider exit from BNSF to me is significantly valuable in the way we're communicating with BNSF. And I'd like to believe our customers will get a benefit out of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. One quick one from me. You talked a little bit about expectations for growing intermodal this year. I guess how do you think about contract rates on the truckload side and where they might put some pressure on that. They've held up largely, but we're starting here from some private carriers that expectations are anywhere between let's call it 3% and 8% down?\nBrad Hicks: I'll start, Jason. And I think maybe you're asking about what we might see on the truckload side and then how we think about that impacting in any way, shape, or form, Intermodal contract rates, if I understood the question correctly. We certainly have seen and expect to see downward rate pressure on the highway side.  The good news is from where we sit in the evolution of our truck line and now with the combination of ICS and JBT, we are for the most part variable on our power and so we're able to ebb and flow with that fluctuation in a much more favorable light than perhaps we were when we were an asset provider. But we do fully expect, you know I'm not going to give guidance on what we anticipate or what we're planning for on the overall rate movement, but we certainly expect it to be down somewhat substantially just as we saw it go up somewhat substantially or abnormally two to three years ago. We are seeing that kind of correction back downward. I think on the intermodal front, the only thing I would say is, historically and then I don't think it'll be any different today. Intermodal will outperform a downturn in truckload rates. I'm not going to ignore that certainly becomes a dialogue and a talking point for our customers, but the savings Intermodal offers against a truckload price continues to be significant and whatever is happening in the truckload contract pricing, Intermodal will continue to be advantageous for our customers for now and for the long-term, particularly when you add the cost of fuel in there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bruce Chan from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBruce Chan: Hey, good morning everyone. Appreciate the time. Maybe another one for you, Brad Hicks on ICS. You talked a bit in the release about a pickup in [tech costs] [ph] in 2022. And I just wanted to get maybe a little bit more color on whether that was tied directly to volumes in that business, you know whether that was a structural investment in the platform or whether that was more inflationary? And then as you think about some of your comments around volumes this year, how much of an opportunity do you have to get more leverage on those costs? Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Bruce. Part of that was by design, it was just making the point that it was a step-up from prior year as we look to continue to finish out some of the tech investments that we've made both at ICS and for JBT in Highway. Really focused on our ability to get productivity gains both from our people and also better transparency and visibility of our platform for both our carriers and our shippers. And so, do we feel like there's upside as we continue to move forward? Absolutely. We've started to realize the benefit of those tech investments as we've talked about for the last few quarters, but there's still work to be done. Even inside of 2023, we expect further build out of those technologies that will help us on productivity and overall execution of the business. All focused on really if you think about the platform, it has enabled us to really think about how we would blend what's historically been our live freight business, which is ICS versus our [drop freight] [ph] business in JBT.  And through that blending, we're able to make better decisions. The drive efficiencies help improve service and then ultimately can be a benefit to our customers through a low cost. So, that's what our focus is going into 2023 and we expect to make continuous improvements throughout.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in. Shelley, I want to go back to a comment you were talking about how the weakness is mostly related to a big inventory correction by customers and likely to get better starting in 2Q, I guess really, how do we know this is not something more [nefarious] [ph] going on beneath these weak inventory driven numbers in terms of the economy weakening or consumer weakening? And then, in terms of the inventory reductions, I know a lot of customers have built these inventory buffers last year because of the supply chain issues as we went from, kind of JIT to just in case. Is your sense that the customers are bringing inventories back to where they used to be or is there still going to be a buffer when this inventory adjustment is set and done? I apologize for the two prongs on this, but it's all related.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Jack. And I like to start with what Brad Delco said, which is our crystal ball is not very good and really not like anybody else's. It's hard and difficult, but we do talk to our customers. And what they're telling us is it's largely an inventory correction happening. I will say, I think they're evaluating part of the flip that Brad Hicks talked about last quarter was really around the capacity side, but also the flip is occurring from an inventory side as we're coming on that back end of COVID, what consumers were buying and what they're purchasing moving into the future. That's part of what's happening from an inventory correction perspective. But I would say, I don't know that we have a great crystal ball, but this is what our customers are telling us. We feel confident, but we're going to be fluid in making sure that we have good conversation around that and apologize, Jeff. It's Jeff, not Jack.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand over to Shelley Simpson, President for any final remarks.\nShelley Simpson: Great. Thank you so much. And I'll also hand it back to John here at the end, but I think you heard us open and talk a lot about the challenges that are being presented, but also the opportunities that we think exist for our customers and also for J.B. Hunt. We're going to continue to be fluid and we are cautious based on what we're seeing on the demand side, but we're very confident in our ability to really thrive in this environment and in any environment. And talking about our three priorities, and those really don't change whether that's this year, the next year, or years after. We're going to stay disciplined with our long-term investment around our people, our technology, and capacity, being fluid in those decisions and making sure we stay close with our customers. We will be very focused on creating more customer value. And this year, we are helping our customers with cost savings. You heard Darren talk about we're going to do that through efficiency. We are talking to them about mode conversion, to the most efficient lane transportation available into Intermodal. We're going to continue to build great fleets for them and create a more efficient fleet. We're going to differentiate our customers' experience in the Final Mile segment and we're also going to leverage J.B. Hunt 360 to bring a flexible cost and capacity solution. Finally, we are going to continue to have long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. Those are our three priorities, but before I turn it over to John, I want to make sure that I say, we are so proud of that over 37,000 employees that have delivered really over the last three years, but even in the fourth quarter, a little bit of noise there, but I'll tell you the effort that our people have made through 2022, our customers notice, our customers trust us, and every day we work very hard to be their trusted provider. We want to continue to accelerate with our customers, but without our people, technology and capacity really would be irrelevant. And so, I just can't emphasize enough the great work our teams have done. We're proud of the teams and we're looking forward to 2023. John?\nJohn Roberts: Good, Shelley. Thank you. Great comment there. I want to go back to the noisy fourth and just say that this claims event has gotten all of our attention. It's a little bit like a [indiscernible]. We wanted to understand our current position and lean into 2023. I'm confident in John's approach here with the changes that he is making and plan to continue to stay very close to that. And keep an eye on it to be sure we're tracking and adjust maybe more affluently, if that's a good way to think about even this part of the business, because none of us like that kind of surprise or [no worries] [ph]. I want to mention that the OEM position that we're in right now, I'm super confident in. I have worked with Nick and the OEMs to help better position the company as a very strategic buyer. We are a very different types of Class 8 and Class 6 buyer. And our [indiscernible] management and our providers are really understanding that. I think that's got a really good long-term positioning value for us. I would also say that very, very closely aligned with our rail providers like I've never seen. And I have either in this job or my prior job have been able to really see how those relationships work. And being close to them, I'm very confident questions about our equipment additions and those ideas in the near-term are appropriate, but I like what Darren said, this is a long march and we are positioned and as good as I've ever seen us. And so, we will be taking advantage of those corrections. And I think we're going to just kind of coin the term leaning forward into 2023, 2024, 2025. My closing word is the same as Shelley\u2019s. I'm really, really proud of all of our people, but I'm also particularly proud of our leadership. It has not been easy. No one thinks it has and no one has claimed that in any part of the industry, but I am particularly proud of what happened in 2020, what happened in 2021, and what has happened so far as we close out 2022 that gives me great confidence when we look forward as to our ability to go capitalize on the opportunities here. So, we appreciate you being on the call and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This call is now completed. We like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360 and how we continue to see the platform bringing together our scroll, but specifically Highway Solutions to drive value for and on-behalf of our customers, whether with or without a drop trailer solution. I'll start off with ICS. ICS top line revenue was down 33% comprised of a 27% decline in volume and a 9% decline in revenue per load. Our truckload volume in the quarter was down 21%. Transactional or spot truckload volume was down year-over-year, but contractual volume was up slightly year-over-year. We experienced additional pressure on our transactional and contractual business in the fourth quarter as demand and volume were unusually soft during what is normally considered peak season. Maybe said differently, there was no peak and demand was actually weaker in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, which is atypical. As we've discussed in the past, our goal remains to leverage our platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. Despite the poor performance on our top line, which did influence our profitability, we do remain in our people and our platform J.B. Hunt 360 to deliver exceptional value for our customers and our shareholders over the long-term. Shifting to truckload, while the freight environment was challenging in the quarter, we continue see evidence of demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better relative to the overall market, which we believe was demonstrated in the quarter. Volume in JBT increased 6% versus the prior year quarter. We believe customers continue to see value in the blending of their live and drop trailer capacity needs that we can provide by leveraging our platform powered by J.B. Hunt 360. As we move into 2023, we will remain focused on leveraging our investments and our people, technology, and capacity to further scale the business. We see a long runway of opportunity for future growth in 360box supported by disciplined investments, solid execution, and earning appropriate return on our capital. Wrapping up on J.B. Hunt 360, I wanted to take the last minute here to make sure the investment community understands that our digital freight marketplace is a tool that drives value across our entire enterprise. For example, it allows us to source third party intermodal dray capacity. It provides us backhaul freight opportunities in DCS, and allows us to prop-up a startup fleet as we hire drivers or source equipment. I believe more obvious, you see the results in ICS and JBT as we are able to run non-asset or an asset-light business leveraging our data and systems to provide almost unlimited capacity for and on-behalf of our customers. ICS and JBT collectively is our highway solution for our customers, representing the largest segment of the North American transportation market. Whether the customer needs drop trailers that historically could only be provided by large asset truckload carriers or a [spot load] [ph] and a live load, live unload network, we are one solution on one system backed by the J.B. Hunt brand. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Ken, I'll make a few comments here. We're still very early in bid season, but our strategy is clearly focused on winning contracted business. The spot market and what we've seen in that over the last several months and we can't necessarily count on when or if that may return or if and when it does, does it get back to what it used to be? Is it something less? And so, we are optimistic about our early feedback in bids and what we're seeing there, meeting our expectations in terms of volume growth of contracted business. So, from a \u2013 on the transactional side, on highway, that's our predominant focus. I think in years past, we will move around the percentages of what's published versus spot and I would anticipate us being on the highest end of that from a contract standpoint versus spot in highway. Intermodal certainly a little different. They don't play the spot market nearly as much. And so, I'll let maybe Darren comment what he's seen. I'll start, Jason. And I think maybe you're asking about what we might see on the truckload side and then how we think about that impacting in any way, shape, or form, Intermodal contract rates, if I understood the question correctly. We certainly have seen and expect to see downward rate pressure on the highway side.  The good news is from where we sit in the evolution of our truck line and now with the combination of ICS and JBT, we are for the most part variable on our power and so we're able to ebb and flow with that fluctuation in a much more favorable light than perhaps we were when we were an asset provider. But we do fully expect, you know I'm not going to give guidance on what we anticipate or what we're planning for on the overall rate movement, but we certainly expect it to be down somewhat substantially just as we saw it go up somewhat substantially or abnormally two to three years ago. We are seeing that kind of correction back downward. I think on the intermodal front, the only thing I would say is, historically and then I don't think it'll be any different today. Intermodal will outperform a downturn in truckload rates. I'm not going to ignore that certainly becomes a dialogue and a talking point for our customers, but the savings Intermodal offers against a truckload price continues to be significant and whatever is happening in the truckload contract pricing, Intermodal will continue to be advantageous for our customers for now and for the long-term, particularly when you add the cost of fuel in there. Thank you, Bruce. Part of that was by design, it was just making the point that it was a step-up from prior year as we look to continue to finish out some of the tech investments that we've made both at ICS and for JBT in Highway. Really focused on our ability to get productivity gains both from our people and also better transparency and visibility of our platform for both our carriers and our shippers.

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good morning, everyone. My comments today will cover our recent performance in the quarter and for the fiscal year 2022. I will also provide you a preliminary view on our capital plan for 2023. Overall, results for the quarter were mixed. As freight volumes were pressured by unseasonably soft demand as compared to prior quarters of the year. That said, operating results were fairly resilient in spite of an unusual item that I'll touch on later. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter grew 4% year-over-year, but operating income declined 13% and GAAP earnings per share declined 16%. We incurred a rather large income statement item in the quarter for approximately $64 million or $0.46 per diluted share for an incremental pretax increase in casualty claims expense. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the second quarter of this year as certain claims from prior year incidents continue to settle at much larger amounts than what we have historically experienced. For the full fiscal year 2022 on a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue grew 22%, operating income grew 27%, and earnings per share grew 29% versus 2021. Based on the solid performance for the year, we voluntarily paid out an 8.8 million appreciation bonus in the fourth quarter to our frontline employees in recognition of their contribution to a fantastic and record year for our company. Of note, we paid a similar appreciation bonus a year ago, so the year-over-year impact was not significant, but worth calling out when looking at sequential performance. We continue to focus on and maintain a strong balance sheet providing us with ample liquidity to deploy capital to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital plan for 2023 contemplates between 1.5 billion and 2 billion of capital for business needs. This includes elevated levels of replacement demand as a result of equipment challenges experienced over the last two years; growth CapEx to support investments, primarily in JBI and DCS; and investments in real estate. Importantly to note, a large portion of our growth CapEx is success-driven based on our ability to secure long-term dedicated contracts. This growth component and the timing uncertainty is the reason for this range. Our capital allocation plan for 2023 also contemplates supporting our dividend consistent with our long-term practice, as well as taking advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares. We will continue to monitor and manage our leverage target to around 1x EBITDA, but are comfortable going above this level if investment opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Nick. Hey, Amit. It feels like a second question, but it's a good topic, so we'll grant it to you. On the appreciation bonus, that was for all frontline employees. That's predominantly drivers, but also includes technicians and then some of our office. So, it's primarily in the JBI and the dedicated segments. That's where we have most of our drivers. I'll give you of the [8.8, 3 million] [ph] was in Intermodal and Dedicated was another 5 million and the rest is spread throughout the other segments. Yeah, Jordan, this is John Kuhlow. I'll address that. We've seen similar to others in the industry over the last 12 months to 18 months a dramatic change in our settlement experience on our claims. All of our claims, but most importantly, our more severe claims are settling at much higher levels than our historical experience. Sometimes to 5x to 10x what they were five years ago. And so, our insurance coverage consists of layers and there are certain layers in there that have caps. And when we exceed those caps, the claims expense reverts to us. And the 30 million that we recorded in the second quarter and the 64 million that recorded in the fourth quarter for a total of 94 million in the current year represents our reserve adjustments on previously incurred claims. So, these are all prior period claims that we've increased our reserves based on our experience. With that, I will tell you that the reason why we've done this is because our insurance claims costs for the claims experience is dramatically going up. And it's a highly unpredictable environment. We are not planning in 2023 for another one-time charge. But as I said, it's highly unpredictable and we're continuing to watch our claims. Now, I will tell you that we have made some changes to our structure going into 2023. And so, we are going to be taking on more coverage and to contemplate this. And I'll go even a little bit deeper than we normally do just because this is a significant area that we're focused on. I think on a rate basis, our premiums are going to be up around 15% just on the core premiums. But as I mentioned, we're adding in new layers of insurance and so our premium base will also increase.  That said, we're expecting our incurred losses to increase as much as 30% to 35% in the next year because of what we're seeing on these, just the movement today on how these claims are being settled. So, a little bit more insight than we would normally give, but wanted to give you a little bit deeper information on what we're seeing in the insurance area. Yes. Well, it kind of goes through all fleets, Intermodal, Dedicated and Final Mile. Talking to our OEMs, they're still going to be constrained, they think this year. And so, we've publicly announced that we're going to a third OEM that will help us alleviate some of those constraints, but based on our forecast, we will still be handling a few hundred trucks that are past due at the end of this year that could move forward if the OEMs numbers come up. But we will have some trades that we're going to carry with us the most part of the year. Yes, there wasn't anything in specifically that I was referring to. It was just more commenting on the strength of our balance sheet, our liquidity position, and the ability to take advantage of opportunities that exist. We still continue to look at buyback or excuse me, at M&A as it becomes available we'll continue to do so. But buybacks and dividends are also a core piece of our capital allocation process and we'll evaluate that as well."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remain strong as we sold approximately 330 trucks in the fourth quarter, which was greater than the trucks sold in the third quarter. This brought our full-year truck sales number to just over 2,000 trucks, which compares to our stated target range of 1,000 to 1,200 per year. Our backlog also remains strong with more opportunities in the pipeline today versus the same time a year ago, but we have seen some moderation in the breadth of the backlog. Our net truck adds in the quarter declined 187 units as compared to the third quarter, largely as a result of us making progress on our equipment trades as new equipment availability improved, but also because some of our downsizing of fleets to match our customers' business levels. As we've discussed before through our CVD process or Customer Value Delivery, we optimize and re optimize our fleets to present value savings opportunities for our customers. This ultimately supports our 98% retention rate of our customers, as well as supports future growth opportunities with these same customers. Going forward, we will remain confident in our ability to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of this business as we deliver superior value for our customers with our highly engineered outsourced solution. Shifting to Final Mile. We remain focused on improving profitability in this business by working through contracts and making sure we are fairly compensated for the value we deliver, achieving the appropriate level of profitability will support further investment needed to meet the growing needs of our customers and the [actually growing] [ph] segment of the market. We will continue to be disciplined on our commitments and remain willing to put business at risk to achieve the appropriate levels of profitability, which could ultimately influence our top line performance in the segment. Demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment has moderated some as the headlines might suggest, but we have seen strength in our fulfillment business with off price retailers seeing lots of opportunities with discounted inventory in the channel. Closing with some general comments on operations. Similar to my update last quarter, we continue to see improvements in areas around professional driver recruitment and retention, but at elevated cost. We are a touch more optimistic about equipment availability in 2023, largely as a result of bringing in a third OEM into our mix, but maintenance cost remains elevated across the company. We remain focused on our safety performance, but are doubling down on strategic initiatives across the company to improve performance in this area given the elevated cost the industry is experiencing. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren. Yes. So, as we look back at Q4, we felt some pressure, I would say, modest, not a lot, but there were some accounts that were given early signals of reduction and we did reduce just a handful of fleets at this point. The primary thing I would say that we addressed was really we've been carrying a lot of older trucks and so we're starting to pick up a few more new trucks and making some headway in reducing that. So, that was the primary, but there was some fleet reduction. Then we're going to stick with our guidance on what we've said on sales in the 800 to 1,000 range. Our pipeline is still full. We feel good. We are experiencing what I would call just some hesitation from deals that are in there that the customers trying to figure out what's going to happen in the first part of the year, but we are still signing deals.  So, we, yes, 1,000 to 1,200 correction, not 800 to 1,000, so 1,000 to 1,200 that we would sell. Also, we have 500 trucks already sold that we will be adding as we get the equipment available. So, we have some momentum on that side."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. My comments today will mirror many of the things I shared last quarter and will focus on our priorities for 2023 and beyond. If you recall, we discussed three priorities as an organization. First, to remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; second, to deliver exceptional value to our customers across our entire organization; and third, to deliver long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As we have discussed, the last two quarters and as John mentioned, we've seen a shift in our market dynamics, but our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. We believe first and foremost, that it starts with our people who are responsible for delivering exceptional value and service to our customers, who in-turn trust us to meet their growing transportation needs. We believe our suite of services across the J.B. Hunt scroll provides customers exceptional value from a company they have learned to trust over the many years and cycles. Our challenge for 2023 is to deliver exceptional value for and on behalf of customers in this market. In the past, we talked about what customers value from their trusted transportation providers, which is cost, service, and capacity. During the pandemic, customers value capacity most with less weight on cost and service. We see the shift occurring now where customers are putting more value on cost or how to save the money and on service quality as capacity is less difficult to source. We believe our suite of services can and will present our customers opportunities to save money with our industry leading intermodal franchise, highly engineered dedicated capacity, a scaled asset light highway services offering, and one of the largest Final Mile Services in North America.  In closing, I want to say that we're approaching 2023 with some caution around recent demand trends, but remain highly confident in our ability to thrive in any environment. We will focus on controlling what we can control, managing our business with a focus on long-term growth while remaining nimble. We will compete in the market to earn, reinforce, and gain our customers' trust, and their freight. We are excited about the many ways and opportunities we have to deliver value to our customers, which we believe will reveal itself over the course of 2023 and well into our future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Good morning, Brian. We did use the theme word and we have through the whole pandemic and that was being fluid, with our customers and just helping them understand where they're at and where we're at from a transportation perspective. We also talked a lot about being cautious in the last discussion. And I think those were some of the demand trends we were starting to see. If you look in the fourth quarter, you saw port activity continue to decline all the way into December. And certainly, we're feeling the impact from that. As we have talked to customers, they have shared with us that there is an inventory correction happening that you've heard both Brad and Darren talk about. And that's really we expect to continue to occur all through the first quarter. We have had good signals from our customers about Q2 starting up back to a more normalized or having a more normal environment. We're not sure at what point that is in Q2, but we do feel like the back half of the year, we have confidence from what our customers are giving us and the data points that they have, what they're going to be doing from an ordering perspective. The freight recession that we see right now is largely inventory driven. We don't see anything else from our customers in total. And then last thing I would say, Brian, if you think about bid season for our company in the one-way part of the business, so this should be all of intermodal and all of highway services. Those really occur in the back half of the year fully loaded. So, if you think about a July 1, if you will, that's really when bid season is complete and we know the results of what's happening in bid season. And that's what really drives what we're going to do from a capital planning. So, you heard Darren say, we're going to be fluid in that part of the process. We have flexibility so that we know how much equipment we can onboard, but I would say, we feel confident in our bid season strategy, our ability to win highway share converted to intermodal and then continuing to grow inside our highway services. And you heard Nick talk about our confidence around dedicated and what our customers are saying there. And I would add, I feel confident about what's happening in the Final Mile space as well. Hey, good morning Ken. I would say our customers in general are going to be implementing between now and July 1. We still have a smaller portion of our business that we'll implement from July 1 all the way through the end of the year, but the bulk of the business, we tend to look at our business in that July 1 through the next year as how we think about revenue quality, our growth plans. Although we budget for a full-year at the calendar year, we actually review what's happened from a bid season at mid-year. And I would say our customers are largely in-line. We do have a few customers that might have changed some of their bids start, but for the most part, they're in-line with what we've historically seen, and I'll let Darren and Brad comment if there's anything else there. Thank you, Jack. And I like to start with what Brad Delco said, which is our crystal ball is not very good and really not like anybody else's. It's hard and difficult, but we do talk to our customers. And what they're telling us is it's largely an inventory correction happening. I will say, I think they're evaluating part of the flip that Brad Hicks talked about last quarter was really around the capacity side, but also the flip is occurring from an inventory side as we're coming on that back end of COVID, what consumers were buying and what they're purchasing moving into the future. That's part of what's happening from an inventory correction perspective. But I would say, I don't know that we have a great crystal ball, but this is what our customers are telling us. We feel confident, but we're going to be fluid in making sure that we have good conversation around that and apologize, Jeff. It's Jeff, not Jack. Great. Thank you so much. And I'll also hand it back to John here at the end, but I think you heard us open and talk a lot about the challenges that are being presented, but also the opportunities that we think exist for our customers and also for J.B. Hunt. We're going to continue to be fluid and we are cautious based on what we're seeing on the demand side, but we're very confident in our ability to really thrive in this environment and in any environment. And talking about our three priorities, and those really don't change whether that's this year, the next year, or years after. We're going to stay disciplined with our long-term investment around our people, our technology, and capacity, being fluid in those decisions and making sure we stay close with our customers. We will be very focused on creating more customer value. And this year, we are helping our customers with cost savings. You heard Darren talk about we're going to do that through efficiency. We are talking to them about mode conversion, to the most efficient lane transportation available into Intermodal. We're going to continue to build great fleets for them and create a more efficient fleet. We're going to differentiate our customers' experience in the Final Mile segment and we're also going to leverage J.B. Hunt 360 to bring a flexible cost and capacity solution. Finally, we are going to continue to have long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. Those are our three priorities, but before I turn it over to John, I want to make sure that I say, we are so proud of that over 37,000 employees that have delivered really over the last three years, but even in the fourth quarter, a little bit of noise there, but I'll tell you the effort that our people have made through 2022, our customers notice, our customers trust us, and every day we work very hard to be their trusted provider. We want to continue to accelerate with our customers, but without our people, technology and capacity really would be irrelevant. And so, I just can't emphasize enough the great work our teams have done. We're proud of the teams and we're looking forward to 2023. John?"

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and talk about our opportunity to deliver exceptional value and capacity to our customers in 2023 and beyond. I'll start by reviewing the performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was seasonally weaker than normal as PCs and activity leading up to the holidays was absent this year. Volumes for the quarter declined 1% year-over-year and by month were up 4% in October, down 3% in November and down 5% in December. We experienced improvements in rail velocity in the quarter and also saw some modest improvements in customer detention of equipment on a sequential basis. That said, we still believe we can see further progress on both fronts, which will further improve velocity and decrease transit times in our system. We believe that current trends around velocity present opportunities for us to sell a higher valued and reliable service product in the market. As we think about 2023, we see a lot of opportunities to deliver value to our customers with our industry leading Intermodal service product. As Shelley discussed, customers have shifted their focus more on costs and service versus capacity. We believe our intermodal service product presents our customers with opportunities to save money by converting highway freight back to intermodal, which reduces their costs and is further supported by fuel cost and carbon emissions savings, while [import volumes] [ph] have been weak, we still see opportunities to gain customers wallet share by converting highway freight and transloading more international freight into our domestic containers.  Additionally, we are in the best position to commit more intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress through the current bid season based on solid improvement in rail service levels and our investment to expand our capacity. Finally, because I anticipate this being a question, I thought I'd address it here. As you are aware, we have more capacity and better alignment with our Western Rail provider, BNSF, and we have both committed to the long-term growth of our collective intermodal service offering. We will compete in the market on the basis of cost capacity and service and we feel confident in our ability to earn our customers' business and grow our wallet share. We are not approaching 2023 with a volume versus price mentality, but how do we set-up our business to drive the greatest shareholder value over the long-term. This was my eloquent way of saying, we historically have not given any guidance on price, volume or margins and we will continue that streak, but also the streak of managing our business to compounding our growth and returns over the long-term. That concludes my prepared remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Sure, Chris. Appreciate the question. I think universally our customers are positive towards re-converting highway business that should be intermodal. I think they are appropriately cautious in saying, hey, J.B. Hunt and BNSF, I need you to prove it to me that you're going to get your service and velocity quality back. And I think we're aligned like we continue to say every quarter more than ever with BNSF on that mission. I have talked to my team at length four months now about rebuilding confidence in our customers. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and intermodal is a way for them to save money. And as velocity improves, it even helps in inventory carrying costs. And so, there's a lot of opportunities for us to continue to talk about growing intermodal and certainly, I don't know of a customer telling us, I'm not interested in converting business to intermodal. I think across the board, our customer base is very receptive, but I do want to at least acknowledge there's a bit of a lag in that process and I think we are busy proving to the customers that the service quality of velocity has improved and will continue to improve as the year goes on. Yeah, I would say, it's early, but so far in January, our rail service is the best it's been since the first quarter of 2020. And so, that's a really positive sign. We're not quite to where we want to be fully, but there is massive improvement in the rail service today. Yes. So, it's a topic for us daily. Our box turns in the fourth quarter were 1.44, nowhere near where we expect them to be. The realities are, we're in a bit of transition period when velocity, customer unloading, a host of challenges, created weakness in our turn ratio. As we come out of that scenario and get back into a more normalized velocity process, gain productivity with our dray fleet, look for productivity in the container fleet, we have lots and lots of capacity to grow into. That's an opportunity for us. I mean in the fourth quarter, in the second half of the year, we're extremely confident in our ability to serve our customers' needs as there will be a return to a peak season shipping. I don't have a number to give you in terms of how many containers come out of the improvement in velocity.  What I would say is, we're probably on a long march and I'm not sure we can accomplish it in 2023, but we anticipate getting back to a turn ratio in the [175 to 180] [ph] in the future. And that will be very direct effort on our part and we'll be cautious with our container purchases, but we have to keep that supply chain open and moving and we need to be onboarding equipment at least some, but we'll be looking to grow our volumes as fast as we can for sure. Well, I appreciate your attempts, Scott, to get me to give guidance. We're not going to be able to do that. Certainly, I do expect intermodal to grow this year on all fronts, on revenue, on earnings, certainly on volume. I think that as we come out of the first quarter, there is a lag. You can see it in the import economy. I mean, there is a significant lag in demand at the moment. Most of our customers, if not all, are optimistic about summer and the rest of the year. There's an inventory correction going on. We have real opportunities to grow our intermodal business and we're working on that every day. Certainly, we're not going to ignore the fact that right now the market is soft in Q1 and inventory is trying to correct. As far as boxes, we really haven't made any announcement about how much equipment we're onboarding this year. What I would say is, it's more than zero, but certainly we're going to meter back a little bit over where we have been as velocity has really, really brought a lot of capacity to our market. So, I'll start Amit. Appreciate the question. I think that we have long said that there's real cost to exit our system in the form of velocity and improvements in driver productivity. Box turns gets most of the focus because it's an easy metric to see and calculate. Our driver productivity is a significant element inside our cost that can also improve as we grow our volumes and get more normalized into our system. Our customers are beginning to unload our equipment faster. The railroads are operating faster, all of which creates some cost takeout. So, as we grow our business, we really feel strongly that we can overcome any, kind of pricing pressure. We're not looking for any, kind of change to our long-term margin guidance and feel confident that we can deliver in that area in 2023 for sure. We said, we expected to grow volume, expect to grow revenue and expect to grow earnings in 2023. Kuhlow? Yes. Good morning and thank you for the question. I started to talk about that pivot at the end of Q3 and we certainly saw that play out. And in my prepared comments, I used the word atypical. We certainly saw that throughout the fourth quarter, a continued weakening from October into December. As we sit here right now just through 15, 16 days in January. I would say, we're consistent with what we saw end of December. However, as Darren mentioned, we do expect sometime maybe second quarter going into third quarter with inventory resets. We would fully expect to see the freight market rebound, but I do feel like this is the area of our company that will most feel the volatility we've long discussed and documented what happened in the spot market and that still sits about where it was. And so, until we see some of that freight demand rebound imports start flowing, I think we'll be in a comparable environment to what we saw in the fourth quarter in brokerage. I just want to jump in, Brian. You asked a little bit of \u2013 you hinted at Eastern rail providers, and in both Eastern railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX are also performing better than they have in 2022 and we're confident in their plans and continue to see really significant opportunities in that part of our network to grow highway share conversion back to intermodal as this year goes on. Sure. I'll take that. I mean, do I think that fluidity in the supply chain will get better with weaker demand and allow the system to kind of reset itself? Absolutely. We're experiencing that today. Our customers are better set up for their supply chains and the port infrastructure is accommodating imports today. And so system is moving more fluidly. As that relates to storage revenues, the only way to answer that is it depends. As long as our customers are unloading faster, then there will be a decline in those revenue streams, but that frees up capacity to operate more shipments on that container every month and that's our focus today.  That's why you'll continue to hear us talk about real cost can come out of our system that can translate into savings for our customers, which just allows us to provide value faster and grow our intermodal business. Well, I mean at the end of the day, we understand pricing pressure out there. Customers want to save money, but again, there is real cost to come out of our system and there's real efficiency for us to gain with growth. And so, as we grow our intermodal business, there is the opportunity to continue to do more loads with the assets that we have. It may not translate into the same income per shipment, but if we're executing more shipments as we move forward and find a way to drive some cost out, then we're going to be able to grow our income really strongly as we grow volume. And that's the mission, is to get out as this bid season goes and as we're out communicating and displaying to our customers that velocity has improved and the intermodal service product has really improved a ton and can get closer in transit to what truck transit is. We feel like we can really grow our business significantly, which will turn into income growth as the year goes on. Well, I'm going to ask Brad to comment on the spot versus [Multiple Speakers]. Well, I think Intermodal contract prices should continue to provide in most corridors a significant saving against highway contract rates, fuel inclusive. And that's been the case forever and there'll be no difference this year. Certainly, there's a handful of markets out there where I think truck spot prices may be applying some pressure at the customer level around their mix of highway and intermodal and we'll watch that and we'll try to adapt and we'll talk to our rail providers and look for ways to take cost out of our systems so that we can be competitive, but at the same time, we're going to be disciplined about our returns and our margin profiles and everything about our business that has been the case forever at J.B. Hunt. So, I don't know that we have enough details yet to really have a strong position on that. We universally hear from our customers that they want to maintain a significant share on BNSF. They have confidence in our ability to talk them through the service improvements and our ability to provide the capacity that Schneider has taken with them. So, I think there's no doubt out of our customer base that we have the capacity to backfill anything Schneider was operating on BMSF. It's also not the top of mind topic when we're talking to our customers, the first subject is not, hey, can you take on Schneider's business? Our process is to go into a customer and talk about their network and look for solutions with intermodal where it's the right solution regardless of who the competitor might be handling that business. So, we're just out trying to solve for our customers and we think they have real confidence in us. I think that the Schneider exit means a ton in the way we talk to BNSF, how we collaborate together, how we're talking about operations in the terminals, how we're going to market together. So, the Schneider exit from BNSF to me is significantly valuable in the way we're communicating with BNSF. And I'd like to believe our customers will get a benefit out of that."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning. My comments will be brief today as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business with more detail. As we reflect on the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2022, we have seen and experienced a cyclical shift in market dynamics that will present both challenges and opportunities as we navigate through the upcoming year. That said, we remain encouraged by trends from our real providers that present opportunities for faster transit times and in-turn greater service quality and value for our customers. We also see some loosening in the labor market and some modest improvements in equipment availability. Conversely, demand for transportation service in the fourth quarter was seasonally weak as customers manage through levels of elevated inventories. As we've discussed in the past, we have confidence in the collective and complementary nature of our distinct businesses that are built to be resilient and durable through market cycles. I have a tremendous amount of confidence in our people led by the 14 officers of our company that have a combined 340 years of experience here at J.B. Hunt. In closing, our team will remain disciplined and focused on charting our course to compound returns on the capital we've deployed to support our long-term growth for the benefit of our stakeholders. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley? Good, Shelley. Thank you. Great comment there. I want to go back to the noisy fourth and just say that this claims event has gotten all of our attention. It's a little bit like a [indiscernible]. We wanted to understand our current position and lean into 2023. I'm confident in John's approach here with the changes that he is making and plan to continue to stay very close to that. And keep an eye on it to be sure we're tracking and adjust maybe more affluently, if that's a good way to think about even this part of the business, because none of us like that kind of surprise or [no worries] [ph]. I want to mention that the OEM position that we're in right now, I'm super confident in. I have worked with Nick and the OEMs to help better position the company as a very strategic buyer. We are a very different types of Class 8 and Class 6 buyer. And our [indiscernible] management and our providers are really understanding that. I think that's got a really good long-term positioning value for us. I would also say that very, very closely aligned with our rail providers like I've never seen. And I have either in this job or my prior job have been able to really see how those relationships work. And being close to them, I'm very confident questions about our equipment additions and those ideas in the near-term are appropriate, but I like what Darren said, this is a long march and we are positioned and as good as I've ever seen us. And so, we will be taking advantage of those corrections. And I think we're going to just kind of coin the term leaning forward into 2023, 2024, 2025. My closing word is the same as Shelley's. I'm really, really proud of all of our people, but I'm also particularly proud of our leadership. It has not been easy. No one thinks it has and no one has claimed that in any part of the industry, but I am particularly proud of what happened in 2020, what happened in 2021, and what has happened so far as we close out 2022 that gives me great confidence when we look forward as to our ability to go capitalize on the opportunities here. So, we appreciate you being on the call and we'll talk to you next quarter."

My name is Tia, and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may proceed.\nBrad Delco: Good afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to take some time to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements.

At this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. As we reflect on the performance of the overall business in the third quarter, we echo many of the same themes discussed on our last call with an intense focus on changes in the freight markets we serve. The results in many areas of our business achieved appropriate targets in light of the cyclical shift in market balance I've referenced last quarter. While some improvement has been seen in rail service and company hiring challenges in particular with our driver force, we continue to face difficulties in equipment availability for growth and replacement, along with the uncertainty of the direction of macro conditions. Clearly, there are also areas of our business with opportunity for correction. That said, let me be clear, the businesses we've built, the changes we've implemented and the team's collective experience have and will continue to reveal themselves as value-enhancing catalysts for our customers, our company and our shareholders. Let me address some of the points around the market dynamics referenced. Further evidence has presented itself over the course of the quarter that requires an increased level of caution and awareness on broader demand trends and economic activity. Data, experience and frequent dialogue with our customers will continue to guide us in this area. The complementary nature and diversification of our businesses will continue to serve us well in this changing market. As mentioned earlier, rail service has shown real signs of improvement in both velocity and reliability during the quarter with positive momentum building, the most notable increase coming from our friends at the BNSF. We are encouraged by the trends and Darren will expand on this area in his remarks. I remain in active and regular dialogue with the senior leaders of our primary rail channels on opportunities and investments required to fully restore service levels needed to capture the opportunities presented with Intermodal. We are optimistic about the path forward with Intermodal and with all aspects of our collective services. Members of our leadership team are here and will cover areas of our business more specifically for you. But at this point, I would like to turn the call over for the first time to our new President, Ms. Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. First off, I'd like to start by saying how humbled and excited I am to be stepping into this new role at J.B. Hunt. Over the years, you've heard me talk about various areas of the business that I've had the honor to lead. I approach this new position with the same passion for our people, all nearly 38,000 employees at J.B. Hunt, and for delivering exceptional service and value to our customers. As John spoke about some of the current indicators that are present in our industry, I want to remind everyone of our say/do culture. And with that, let me share with you what our go-does or priorities are right now for us as an organization. Over my 28 years at the company, I've been fortunate to have worked with some great leaders. As I sit here today, I'm reminded of a saying our Chairman would say and that is, don't starve your opportunities. As an organization, we recognize unique and significant opportunities in the marketplace that have been and are being presented to us. As a result, we will remain committed to disciplined investments in our company foundations, which I spoke to last quarter. That is our people you trust, technology that empowers and capacity to deliver. When we make the right investments in the right people, give them the proper tools to equip and empower them to deliver value and exceptional service to our customers, all of our stakeholders should reap the benefit. So priority one: remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in and for our future growth, and that starts first and foremost with our people. Over the last two months or so, I've traveled and met with our people in the field and across the organization, and I asked each of them the same question, how can you, in your role, drive more value for our customers? I'm encouraged by the feedback I received, the energy of our people and the rallying around just that simple question. As an organization, we need to deliver the greatest value to our customers by providing unmatched service at a fair and equitable return. So much across our organization goes into that equation from being cost competitive, being quick to adapt, making the customer experience exceptional and making sure we are in a position to say yes to our customers' growing needs. So priority number two: deliver exceptional value for our customers across the entire organization. Finally, I believe in something John has always shared with us, and that is growth is oxygen. It provides opportunities for our people in the organization to also grow, develop and build meaningful and lasting careers. We have a deep and tenured bench of talent across our organization who are leading and developing our future leaders. Having a disciplined approach to our capital allocation process supports and funds the investments we make in our people, technology and capacity to better serve our customers. This recipe should continue to support our future growth and value we create for our shareholders. So I'll leave you with one last priority to deliver strong value for our shareholders. As John alluded to in his comments, we see further evidence of a shift in marketplace dynamics that will require us to remain fluid in our approach to managing our business. We often reference that word throughout the pandemic as challenges and uncertainties were present, which feels appropriate at this time as well. Our business leaders will cover our plans with you in more detail. And that concludes my comments, so I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow.\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will be brief and will cover our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis. I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the quarter on a consolidated basis. As John remarked, we hit targets in areas of our business and fell short in others, but that highlights the benefits of our diversified and complementary model. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 22% year-over-year, operating income grew 32% and GAAP earnings per share grew 37%. From a cost perspective, we continue to experience inflationary pressures across most areas of our business but primarily around labor, equipment, including both parts and labor and in the area of claims. We are keeping a close eye on receivables, credit and bad debt as economic conditions change and we'll continue to monitor the environment and manage accordingly. We purchased just shy of 350,000 shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date spend on repurchases to approximately $300 million. We will continue to explore share repurchases going forward as opportunities are presented, and we remain committed to buybacks as a capital management tool with support from our Board. Our balance sheet remains strong with net leverage moderately below our target of 1x trailing 12 months EBITDA. During the quarter, we paid off $350 million of senior notes and entered into a new $1.5 billion credit facility, increasing our flexibility and overall liquidity for future needs. On net CapEx, we spent just over $1 billion year-to-date and expect to fall short about $1.5 billion plan for the year. Our capital expenditures in the future will largely be dependent upon business needs, but levels may remain elevated as our replacement needs are high, given equipment delivery delays and supply chain constraints experienced over the last two years. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, John. Good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as we added more than 450 trucks to the fleet during the quarter. While our backlog remains strong, we have some moderation to more normalized levels after two years of significantly above-normal trends. We sold approximately 280 trucks' worth of new business during the course of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total just shy of 1,700 trucks. As a reminder, this is well above our long-term guidance of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks per year through just the first three quarters of the year. The performance of the business continues to meet expectations as mature accounts are managed diligently and start-up accounts are progressing as expected. We continue to see pressure on equipment and maintenance-related expenses and that remains an area of focus. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and remain excited about executing our plan to grow the business as we deliver exceptional value to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile. As we've discussed for the last several quarters, our focus has been on delivering exceptional service but ensuring the quality revenue aligned with the value we deliver to customers. While much work has been done, I am pleased with the progress. Much work remains though. Overall, we saw good demand for Final Mile Services in the quarter in our off-price retail channel with fulfillment as well as the appliance and furniture delivery market. Similar to DCS, the sales activity is moderating some and we will manage accordingly. Going forward, we remain focused on our profit improvement initiatives while investing in a differentiated service experience for our customers to deliver value to each of them. Closing with some general comments on operations. We have seen improvements in the areas around professional driver recruiting and retention, although at elevated cost. That said, we have not seen much improvement in equipment availability, which continues to put pressure on our maintenance costs. We are still holding trades on several thousand trucks, which were required to support our growth over the last two years. We will make progress in this area over the next year, but we will be dependent upon how much equipment is needed to support our growth. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review performance of our Intermodal business, including an update on network fluidity and the opportunities we have to deliver exceptional capacity and value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing the performance from the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity continued to support growth in our business despite challenges related to rail velocity, customer unloading activity and overall supply chain uncertainties facing our customers. Volumes for the quarter were up 4% year-over-year and by month were plus 4% in July, plus 6% in August and down 2% in September. Today, so far in October, volumes have rebounded from weaker demand in September. Last quarter, we discussed the challenges we were facing from a rail network velocity perspective, and I expressed confidence and a bit of optimism that it would get better. While we are not back to where we need to be, I am pleased to say that we saw a meaningful improvement in velocity and performance from BNSF as the quarter progressed, but in particular in mid-August and throughout the remainder of the quarter. We continue to work with our primary channel providers at the most senior levels to improve our service quality and reliability, which presents our organization significant opportunities that I will address next. Recognizing John's comments about the shift in market balance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers with our Intermodal service offering. With greater velocity in our network, we are presented with an opportunity to remove meaningful costs in our business due to lack of productivity. As I've said before, our customers will participate in those savings while also benefiting from faster and more reliable service. We think this puts us in a position to be able to deliver meaningful value for our customers as they look for cheaper, more efficient and the most sustainable way of moving their freight. As we stand here today, I'm confident that customers have greater demand for our capacity as speed and reliability improve. And I believe we have a greater line of sight to that now than at any other point over the last two years. In closing, I would like to drive home the point that our business and our rail channel providers all benefit from service quality improvements, and we remain motivated and incentivized to deliver it. We have significant productivity and cost saving opportunities that will present themselves in our dray operations as rail service quality makes further improvements. I look forward to discussing our progress in this area in the quarters ahead. That concludes my prepared remarks so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Starting off with ICS, top line revenue was down 11% comprised of an 8% decline in volume and a 4% decline in revenue per load. Diving into those numbers a little deeper, truckload volume in the quarter was down only 1%. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see pressure in the spot or transactional market and volume but also in rate and margin. Similar to last quarter, our published or contractual volume was up double digits on a percentage basis year-over-year in the quarter, offset by our spot or transactional business down double digits. We continue to manage the business to outperform the market, and we accomplished that against our benchmarks during the quarter. As John discussed, we are seeing a shift in balance in the market or a pivot, as I like to say, and we are navigating through that, but remain focused on our long-term goals and targets. I remain confident in our people and our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, to deliver an efficient and valued service offering to our customers. Shifting over to Truckload. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see steady and solid demand for our drop trailer network service offering we call J.B. Hunt 360box. Volume grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to believe customers are finding value in the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs, essentially offering customers the flexibility and ease of use of a drop trailer for use in less dense freight lanes while also offering access to the vast amount of capacity available on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform for freight that would typically be handled by large asset-based carriers. One simple and seamless solution provided by experienced managers of trailing assets and powered by one of the largest capacity sourcing platforms, J.B. Hunt 360, which I'll touch on next. We continue to see the strong usage and activity on our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. As we've entered this new market paradigm, we are seeing the expected shifts in usage, including increased offers per load, but also carrier stickiness and measurable data on our ability to buy capacity against the market. Being a little more transparent, over the last two years, our customers relied on our platform to find capacity when it was extremely difficult and challenging to source. We were the go-to, and in this market pivot, admittedly, we may have had too much exposure to spot and project-related business. We will make adjustments and pivot ourselves where needed, but remain confident to investments in our people, technology and assets to support our long-term growth. That concludes my comments so I'll turn it back to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thanks, Brad. I'd just like to remind all the participants on the call that we're going to do one question and then move on to the next, since we have such a long list of folks. So with that, Tia, we're ready to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Afternoon guys. Darren, just wanted to talk on the Intermodal side. Do you think -- was September impacted by rail strike noise or demand? And then maybe any color on how you think about fourth quarter volume? And then just a big picture question. It does feel like Intermodal pricing for now is holding up a lot better than Truckload but maybe that's impacting -- having some negative impact on demand. So I guess my real question is, how are you approaching bid season? Are you more focused on market share? And if volumes are up and fluid is up but rates are down next year, do you think you can grow Intermodal EBIT next year? I know there's a bunch but whatever you could take. Thank you.\nBrad Delco: Scott, this is Brad. I think I counted five questions there, and I'll just -- we'll turn it over to Darren and let him start talking.\nDarren Field: Okay. First of all, I don't want to spend all afternoon talking about potential rail labor situation. Look, September was obviously impacted by rail labor or the threat of that. Every year, we have network challenges that we don't always call out in these sorts of calls. And in some ways, the results in September was similar to a bad weather event. It was short term in nature. Volumes were improving coming out of August. The rail labor situation was probably one of a couple of several things that might have influenced customers. And that came and went, and volumes recovered back to where they were prior to that. So I do think that customer demand right now is -- was showing improvement in August and it continues to today. As far as pricing goes, I think we're just way too early in the bid cycle to kind of know what to predict there. Obviously, the bid cycle is important to us. We continue to dialogue with our customers about ways that we can take cost out of our system together. And as we have that dialogue, we fully anticipate the customer to get a benefit when we work together to do that. I've said that for the better part of the year now and still believe that strongly. I don't know where to even go next. I'm just going to stop there.\nJohn Roberts: Balance over there.\nBrad Delco: Thanks, Scott. We'll try to get -- I bet you we'll get some of those other questions from some next callers. Tia, next question, please.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi, great. Thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe sticking on Intermodal, maybe want to sort of understand the comments around the cost sharing and savings that could happen in sort of a more fluid rail environment. So I guess maybe the specific question is, do you think about this more on a profit per load basis where maybe you can maintain profit per load as your costs come down, some of that share? Or is it more on a margin basis? I guess I just want to make sure I'm sort of understanding how you guys are thinking about that. And certainly, probably growth comes into effect, to some extent, next year as well leaning into that to some extent. So I know it's a little bit sort of a loose question but I'm kind of curious how you guys are thinking about profit per load relative to margin growth next year.\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, we contemplate the productivity we can generate on a container in a month. That certainly drives some of our thought process. So as we can move more loads on a container in a month as velocity improves, there's some benefit there that we would anticipate sharing with our customers. We're very focused on ROIC-only margin as an output. And as we layer on more volume and look for ways to grow, we would anticipate that there's a benefit in our underlying cost from that. And I would just highlight and tried to in some of the prepared comments, our drayage activity can also get a productivity benefit out of improved rail service. We would anticipate an improvement in the productivity of our drivers and our tractor resources as well as rail service improves. And that, too, is something that we would anticipate our customers can benefit from.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra for Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks operator. Hi, everyone. Darren, can you just talk about how bid compliance maybe has trended over the course of this year? I mean, obviously, truck spot rates have declined significantly, but the spread between Intermodal Contract and Truckload Contract is still pretty wide. But the spot market is a lot looser but rail service has gotten better. I'm just trying to understand if there's anything that you could observe in terms of bid compliance and maybe give us a sense of the psychology of kind of the -- what the customer shippers are thinking. And then just related, piggybacking on Chris' question a little bit around, I want to understand what the cyclicality of Intermodal profits are on your view. I mean, I would say that there are a lot of investors out there that look at Intermodal profits up 65%, 70% versus 2019. I think what you guys did this quarter was an all-time record. How do you answer some of the investor concerns that, hey, a lot of this is attributable to a pricing cycle, and when that's over, we're going back to a profit per load in the 200s instead of the 400s where you are today. If you can just answer those couple of questions, that would be great.\nDarren Field: Well, I'll start on the bid compliance. I think that somewhere in 2020 and '21, we've highlighted that bid compliance deteriorated from our previous marks and somewhere in the 60% to 70% range of an award. And maybe in prior terms, it would hover between 70% and 80%. I think that your question around spot capacity influencing that, we've been in this 60% to 70% range for the better part of two years. And I would not say that anything this summer or more recent with truckload spot prices falling, impacting customer bid compliance in our Intermodal business. I don't believe we're actually seeing that, so I don't know how much of an influencer that is. Certainly, truckload pricing will always be an influencer to some degree at Intermodal, but it's not the only influencer of it. And to investors concerned about or that to your second question, I would just say, historically, Intermodal prices haven't fallen and haven't moved to the magnitude that truckload rates maybe have at times. And the ability -- what's different this cycle is that ability for us to shed costs that I've highlighted. I mean, I think that the pricing strength of these last 1.5 years of pricing activity is because all of our costs are up so much. And I mean that's J.B. Hunt's cost, that's our rail providers' cost and it certainly is drayage activity in the industry, equipment costs more. It's everywhere you look, there were really significant cost increases. And so to me, that's one of the biggest differences moving forward. How does the industry shed some of that cost? And productivity is a big part of that. So some of our ability to move in that area really depends on how much additional productivity we can get out of our resources, both our assets and our people.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. You may proceed.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good afternoon. So it sounds like rail service got significantly better over the course of the quarter. So I was curious if you could share where box turns are running today, just to put some numbers around that comment. And then Darren, you said things have snapped back from an Intermodal volume perspective in October. Can you quantify where volumes are running quarter-to-date?\nDarren Field: Well, I don't know that I can clarify where volumes are running quarter-to-date. What I would just tell you is we saw that -- maybe I'll say it like this. September ran minus 2%. You heard that in my prepared comments. I think that had we not had a disruption from the potential of a rail strike, volumes in September would have been more between 3% and 4% positive. And I think that we're back in line with where we were running throughout the quarter without that disruption. So I'll just answer that question that way. In terms of box turns, for the quarter, box turns were, hang on a sec, 1.5, so nowhere near where we would anticipate or expect our box turns to improve to. We called out that velocity really began to improve in the second half of August and continued to improve throughout September. And I just -- there will be somewhat of a lag as volume -- as velocity improves to the onboarding of new volume that our customers want to see and want to gain confidence in our ability to sustain that velocity and service performance. So we didn't experience any real benefits from that service and velocity improvements during those six weeks in Q3 in terms of volume and you had a lot of noise there that I just mentioned related to volume in September. So as we go through December and as we continue to highlight benefits from faster velocity to our customers and as we go through the bid season, we absolutely do anticipate an improvement in the box turns.\nJustin Long: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Nick, I wanted to ask you about DCS. You've had like six straight quarters now of pretty breakneck growth on the truck count. And you've been onboarding a lot and there's start-up costs associated with it. Your comments about seeing some signs of slowing in demand, does this give you the opportunity now to kind of let some of that recent start-up business reach the maturation stage? And maybe if we see a little bit of a slowdown on the top line growth, we can now start to see the margin expansion in that business through 2023?\nNick Hobbs: That's a good question. I would say typically, if our sales volume slows down, our start-ups diminish, you would see our margins improve. But we're facing a couple of headwinds. One, fuel cost is up and that dilutes our margin a little bit. But additionally, our maintenance cost is sky high because of all the growth we've added. We've kept trucks longer and so that's increased our maintenance. If I felt that we could get that fixed next year, I would say yes. But in talking with the manufacturers, and we're even adding a third OEM to our mix to try to help us, we're not going to have it solved as they see demand going forward. So we're going to be carrying used trucks all through next year, not to the level this year. So normal times, yes, but this is still abnormal just because of carrying trucks and the price of fuel.\nJon Chappell: Okay, understood. Thanks Nick.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. Just a question, just overall thoughts on supply chain congestion. Obviously, the rails have certainly been part of it. Perhaps things are improving there. But where do you see the remaining roadblocks to maybe normalizing and hopefully improving box turns as we go from here? Thanks.\nDarren Field: So I'd say -- something I haven't really highlighted yet today is just customer inventory levels are higher. And that's certainly influencing some of the demand and ability to process and speed up asset utilization. So that's certainly a factor. I would also highlight that I think throughout the third quarter, international import volumes continued to -- somewhat of a logjam at the ports. But as the quarter progressed, I think a lot of that business has cleaned up. But there still is a lot of noise in the system related to getting cargo out of containers, into warehouses, on shelves, to your home, all of those aspects. But they're -- the biggest factor to me right now is just inventories are elevated, and so customers are working hard to find a place to put inventory.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good evening. Just want to go back to the comments around disciplined investment, coupled with not starving opportunities here. Just maybe a little more color or expansion on how you view investing through the cycle here. Is there a specific area of focus that you want to focus on here for that capital allocation? Just any color as we sort of we're working through this potential downturn on your investment capabilities.\nShelley Simpson: Allison, we've been using a keyword here really since the pandemic started, and that word has been fluid. And that has been as our customers have been uncertain as to what the future has either been held for them or will be held for them in moving forward. They've really struggled to find out what was going to happen from a labor perspective, what would happen certainly with the rail congestion that you've heard Darren talk about. But also just overall from a consumer perspective, what people would be buying and how to put inventory in the right places. I think we've done a great job over the last nearly three years of making sure that we stay fluid. We stay fluid in our conversations with our customers, and that's going to continue. As you heard John mentioned in the prepared remarks, and then you've heard that throughout each of the segment presidents, we're going to continue to stay focused on creating value for our customers. We're going -- I've stated several times that I believe that the supply chain is the most inefficient at least that I can remember in several years. A big part of that's been from the pandemic. So we're going to be focused on taking costs out of the equation for our customers across all five of our segments where we can do that and sharing back with our customers in that cost while continuing to maintain our margin targets within each of the five different segments. So that fluid response to our customers, we're having to adapt more quickly, be more agile to the process. Our capital allocation process will continue to follow the exact same way that we have done over the last five years. But it will be with what I would tell you from a people and overall capacity perspective. We've been very offensive over the last year or two, making sure that we are prepared and ready for our customers. This is going to give us a chance to take a little bit more of a breadth and be a little more structured discipline, staying in tune and in line with what the market is doing.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Zazula with Barclays. You may proceed.\nDavid Zazula: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Brad. I mean, this is the second straight quarter of sequential declines in J.B. Hunt 360 revenues. I know you talked about good activities. I guess is that a sign of maturity in the program or customers being a little more selective in where they go looking for that type of activity? Or does it speak to the project volumes that you had talked about? Just if you could touch a little more on that.\nBrad Hicks: Yes, David. Good afternoon. Shelley just spoke about being fluid, and really what we saw at the very end of Q2 and we spoke of it in our second quarter and we saw more of that in Q3 is really just the downward pressure and reduction in overall spot volumes that we see inside of the marketplace. There's no secret to the downward pressure that, that's had on rates, in particular there, more pronounced than we historically see. In my prepared comments, I referenced the term several times, pivot. Others call it the flip, but we're going from this tight capacity market to a much looser capacity market. And that's being driven somewhat by a softening in volumes that are -- we see, first and foremost, inside of brokerage. But from a fundamental standpoint, we do feel like our investments inside of J.B. Hunt 360, and I would say that many times, it often gets linked specifically to ICS. It's important that everybody on the call understands that it is a product and a value for our entire organization. And we see several data points that it spins off that value inside of Intermodal, inside of Dedicated and even inside of JBT with 360box. And so those are the areas where we do feel like it's a longer play for us. It's not a one-month or one-quarter play, and we're just navigating this current environment the best we can. It's a fight out there for volume in the brokerage space. And I don't think that's any secret. But we know that, that will course correct at some point in time. We'll see some exits in the marketplace. There's already data points that reveal that capacity is leaving and likely more of it to come depending on how significant the downward trends are. And so we continue to feel confident. We continue to make investment both in the technology of 360 and also our people.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, great. Good afternoon. And I guess just to clarify, I did turn on the Yankee game for this, so excited to be here. Nick, great job at Dedicated. But sorry, Brad Delco, just a quick one for Darren also. You took on a lot of boxes that you ordered a while ago into a peak season that didn't exist, it seems like. Can you remind us your thoughts on taking on capacity now versus the ability to get fluidity or increased turnover, what the impact is on margins and your thoughts then into '23 on margins? I'm just trying to contrast that with John's comments earlier about increased caution.\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, we onboarded a lot. We announced an expansion of our equipment as we move into the next three to five years. We made that big announcement back in March. We've onboarded equipment as the year has gone on. And certainly, peak season volumes aren't where we would have anticipated them to be just, I don't know, four or five months ago. Certainly would have anticipated stronger volumes. Peak season this year just doesn't appear to be much of an event, I'll just say it like that, while we're still experiencing growth. As we go into next year, onboarding equipment will continue to run at a pace where our growth is supporting. Now as we get velocity improvements, that's unlocking capacity in our existing fleet and will have us really studying how quickly to onboard that equipment as we move into next year. Now at the same time, if it's -- if there's an opportunity to onboard equipment for whatever reason at a cost benefit to us, then we may choose to do that so that we can be a little more agile with our customer demand, to be responsive as we would anticipate some customers to experience challenges related to service that they're receiving from other carriers all trying to find a slot on our competing Western rail carrier. So we do absolutely anticipate an opportunity to grow from that scenario. And having equipment available and ready for that opportunity is one of the core important strategies for our -- the next year. I'm not going to answer margin questions on that, Ken. I'm sorry, it's just not something we're going to do.\nShelley Simpson: Ken, it's Shelley...\nKen Hoexter: That was worth a try.\nShelley Simpson: Ken, it's Shelley. Let me add one thing to that well. I think you heard Darren earlier -- you heard Darren say earlier that ROIC is our focus. And we've made sure through 2021 and 2022 that for our customers, that they could have an indifferent answer if they were to hold our boxes. And so for us, from a return perspective, us bringing that equipment, if you think about the problems we had from a railroad congestion and also from our customers not being able to unload our equipment, I think I would suggest that our volumes would be negative at this point based on those two factors. So us bringing in that equipment, being ready and prepared from an ROIC perspective, we are in an in and indifferent position. And so that allows to lean forward. Knowing that our customers' inventory issues and the rail congestion would be shorter term in nature, it would prepare us better for our long term. Knowing that we have such a great target and converting freight off the highway into the most efficient land transportation in North America.\nJohn Roberts: And Ken, I'm just going to add also to give Darren a breather so he can catch a drag in between questions. He said it best. Just keep in mind where we get these boxes currently and the difficulty in getting them here. And so we have to plan accordingly to be able to be nimble. The other thing, as these are 20-year assets, they're priced and modeled from an ROIC perspective to include downturns throughout those 20 years. And so all of that is kind of taken into consideration in terms of our ability to go out and buy and add those units.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one for Brad Hicks. Can you just clarify if there's anything else in ICS this quarter that impacted margins? And you talked about spot and your need to pivot, but I think there's also a mention of some higher claims and bad debt expense. So anything incremental on that would be helpful. And then just looking longer term, as you think about Intermodal, historically hasn't been able to get volume and price at the same time or it's difficult to do that. So the secular growth has been a little harder to come by from our perspective. Do you think the investments that BN is doing expanding San Bernardino, you got Barstow, those are coming out multiple years from now. But you've been doing more on transloading. Are these the sorts of things that can make the volume growth and the earnings growth behind that a little more durable, a little more secular than what we've been seeing, primarily driven by the truck market? Thanks.\nBrad Hicks: Yes, so I'll start. Thank you. We just called attention to a couple of categories, and we have some bad debt claims at points in times. Usually, they're pretty lumpy for us. And so over time, there wasn't anything that stood out if we look at the business in terms of years. But when we do have bankruptcies through customers that we do business with, and when that happens, it hits you at once. And so I think we did see some of that in the third quarter. Not over-concerned as we look at a broader window of time and where we're at, not seeing any negative trends there per se. But when it does hit, it is a little bit more pronounced in a particular month or a particular quarter. As it relates to the second part of your question on kind of what we're seeing in spots, we saw those continue to decline. Can't really say and I don't want to predict what the future is, so I don't know that we've officially reached bottom yet. I would say that it's somewhat stabilized in the more recent periods of weeks. But we also see other indices, for example, the AOTVI that would suggest that volume trends have continued to decelerate in October versus what we saw in September. And so that's where paying attention to every data point we can to try and get a read. The best thing that we can do is just stay as close to our customers to try and promote and grow on the contractual business side so that we're not as volatile per se in the spot market, and that's what our focus is going into bid season.\nDarren Field: Okay, I'll try to dive off into your question there, Brian, on Intermodal. I mean, clearly, in those years, 2015 maybe to 2020, you seem to have a lot of focus on whether or not we can grow both volume and price. Prior to that time, I think we had some success with that. And during that time window, there was a lot of choppiness related to our relationship with BNSF. There was PSR implementation, which in some ways, shifted some challenges from the railroads out to us. So just a lot of challenges related there. And as we move into the future, I think our relationship with BNSF has never been stronger, and we feel very confident about the work that they are doing, and we are doing together to grow our Intermodal product. We would anticipate that the value proposition we deliver to our customers is also driving enough value to warrant the quality returns that both BNSF and J.B. Hunt would expect. All that being said, does that mean we get a rate increase? I don't know. I know that expansion of their footprint is good for our Intermodal business. And so we're very excited about all the projects that they have underway. And certainly transload opportunities are big for us and will continue to be important strategies that we work on together with the railroad.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon. One short-term question for John. John, I think you said at the top of the call that some areas of the business may be opportune for correction. Can you just expand on that a little bit more what exactly you meant by that? And also, Shelley, congrats on the new position. Maybe I can ask you a longer-term question. What do you think are the biggest opportunities and risks ahead for J.B. Hunt over the next five to 10 years? Thanks.\nShelley Simpson: Thanks, Ravi. I might try to take both of those. Let me just talk a little bit about the opportunities that we have. I think as the market is moving and our fluid approach, we recognized in some of the areas that we've invested in heavily, there's some rightsizing that we have to do. Brad talked a little bit about that in being more offensive with our customers and trying to make sure we're set up from a sales perspective, but then also looking at what is the five-year plan around that business and making sure that we're more in tune with what the model would suggest. There are other areas of opportunity like what's happening in our maintenance. And that number for us, the amount of trucks that we actually have that we are holding is becoming more and more impactful to our bottom line. But it is allowing us to serve customers and we're staying in line with our customers from a price perspective. I think each one of the five segments have recognized where their opportunities are. Nick, I know, talked about Final Mile also in the beginning with our cost recovery efforts. And I was just making sure that the great value we create for our customers that we're in alignment from a return perspective. And that's going to take us more than a quarter or even more than a few quarters. That's a longer-term strategy for us with our customers walking each 1 independently through that. So I feel like that is really our greatest opportunity. I might add this. What I'm most excited about, our biggest opportunity is really to get the entire organization to understand the level of value we can create for our customers with our mode-agnostic approach. We have the best opportunity of anyone to give a customer an answer that is best for them in cost, service and capacity because we serve the entire supply chain in North America. And with five fairly healthy segments now with the growth trajectory, that really has a market for each one of them in a totally different number, totally different size than what it is today, we think we're just getting started. So I think I'm excited about our long-term opportunity for growth while maintaining our margin and being disciplined in the way that we conduct our business.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. If you can just address the correction comment, kind of what that was about?\nShelley Simpson: Say that one more time, Ravi.\nRavi Shanker: The comment on the top of the call about the areas that are opportune for correction, kind of was that something specific or was that just a broad comment?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, I would say -- well, I would say we've tried to highlight those. Final Mile is one of the areas that we're focused in on. I think for ICS, staying long-term structured and disciplined in the long-term plan and just making sure our costs stay in line with that long-term plan is those are probably the two areas that would focus.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nAri Rosa: Great. Hi, good evening/good afternoon. So I wanted to ask about rate trends on Dedicated. Obviously, we've seen spot rates come down quite a bit. Dedicated seems like it's been more resilient. Just wanted to see if you guys could address to what extent you think those two can remain decoupled as we think about 2023 and bid season coming up.\nNick Hobbs: Yes. Thank you. I'll take that. Most of our business, I believe the exact number is about 78% of our business in Dedicated is tied to some index or some contractual annual increase, and we've been very successful in getting those. And in addition to the ones that do not have indexes, we were able to get rates this year as needed for driver pay and various things. So what the spot market does up and down doesn't really affect us. It may change while we sell because there's a lot of capacity demands that we see, but we sign up long-term deals. And so when we sell those, the way we sell those, it's for the long term, not quarter-to-quarter or anything like that. So we view it as having very little impact on us from the spot market.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. I will pass it back to the management team for closing remarks.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, and thank you for spending time with us on this quarterly call. I think you heard us talk a lot about the caution that we have. But I want to make sure that I talk about why we've mentioned caution. For us, caution is just a readiness to pivot. It's a readiness to be available for our customers and understanding what's happening in the market and how we can best prepare ourselves and be ready. With the executive management team having over 25 years' experience at J.B. Hunt, I think we've seen this before. We've seen signs similar, and we want to make sure that we can pivot with our customers and make sure that we continue to create great shareholder value. But might I say that this was our best quarter in our history. It is maybe more muted because we think about that readiness that we're attempting to really solve for. It was the best quarter for JBI. It's the first time DCS hit over $100 million in operating income. And so we're proud of the work that we've done. And I think that you see the results overall. And I also think that you see our diversified portfolio and making sure that we are mode-agnostic with our customers. But speaking of our customers, sharing improvements with our customers is good. It's good for them. It's good for our business. And I think that's going to be important for us as we continue to move forward. The supply chain is inefficient, and we want to help it become a more efficient supply chain. We're a growth company. And we have a complete and total understanding of the importance of ROIC. That will be our focus. We want to create more value for our customers by really trusting the people that take care of them every day. And so I close by saying thank you to the nearly 38,000 people. They work hard every single day on behalf of our customers. And we're going to continue to remain disciplined in our approach, but make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that are present with our customers and serving them with more value. With that, looking forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I'll also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Starting off with ICS, top line revenue was down 11% comprised of an 8% decline in volume and a 4% decline in revenue per load. Diving into those numbers a little deeper, truckload volume in the quarter was down only 1%. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see pressure in the spot or transactional market and volume but also in rate and margin. Similar to last quarter, our published or contractual volume was up double digits on a percentage basis year-over-year in the quarter, offset by our spot or transactional business down double digits. We continue to manage the business to outperform the market, and we accomplished that against our benchmarks during the quarter. As John discussed, we are seeing a shift in balance in the market or a pivot, as I like to say, and we are navigating through that, but remain focused on our long-term goals and targets. I remain confident in our people and our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, to deliver an efficient and valued service offering to our customers. Shifting over to Truckload. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see steady and solid demand for our drop trailer network service offering we call J.B. Hunt 360box. Volume grew 13% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to believe customers are finding value in the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs, essentially offering customers the flexibility and ease of use of a drop trailer for use in less dense freight lanes while also offering access to the vast amount of capacity available on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform for freight that would typically be handled by large asset-based carriers. One simple and seamless solution provided by experienced managers of trailing assets and powered by one of the largest capacity sourcing platforms, J.B. Hunt 360, which I'll touch on next. We continue to see the strong usage and activity on our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. As we've entered this new market paradigm, we are seeing the expected shifts in usage, including increased offers per load, but also carrier stickiness and measurable data on our ability to buy capacity against the market. Being a little more transparent, over the last two years, our customers relied on our platform to find capacity when it was extremely difficult and challenging to source. We were the go-to, and in this market pivot, admittedly, we may have had too much exposure to spot and project-related business. We will make adjustments and pivot ourselves where needed, but remain confident to investments in our people, technology and assets to support our long-term growth. That concludes my comments so I'll turn it back to Brad Delco to give instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Yes, David. Good afternoon. Shelley just spoke about being fluid, and really what we saw at the very end of Q2 and we spoke of it in our second quarter and we saw more of that in Q3 is really just the downward pressure and reduction in overall spot volumes that we see inside of the marketplace. There's no secret to the downward pressure that, that's had on rates, in particular there, more pronounced than we historically see. In my prepared comments, I referenced the term several times, pivot. Others call it the flip, but we're going from this tight capacity market to a much looser capacity market. And that's being driven somewhat by a softening in volumes that are -- we see, first and foremost, inside of brokerage. But from a fundamental standpoint, we do feel like our investments inside of J.B. Hunt 360, and I would say that many times, it often gets linked specifically to ICS. It's important that everybody on the call understands that it is a product and a value for our entire organization. And we see several data points that it spins off that value inside of Intermodal, inside of Dedicated and even inside of JBT with 360box. And so those are the areas where we do feel like it's a longer play for us. It's not a one-month or one-quarter play, and we're just navigating this current environment the best we can. It's a fight out there for volume in the brokerage space. And I don't think that's any secret. But we know that, that will course correct at some point in time. We'll see some exits in the marketplace. There's already data points that reveal that capacity is leaving and likely more of it to come depending on how significant the downward trends are. And so we continue to feel confident. We continue to make investment both in the technology of 360 and also our people. Yes, so I'll start. Thank you. We just called attention to a couple of categories, and we have some bad debt claims at points in times. Usually, they're pretty lumpy for us. And so over time, there wasn't anything that stood out if we look at the business in terms of years. But when we do have bankruptcies through customers that we do business with, and when that happens, it hits you at once. And so I think we did see some of that in the third quarter. Not over-concerned as we look at a broader window of time and where we're at, not seeing any negative trends there per se. But when it does hit, it is a little bit more pronounced in a particular month or a particular quarter. As it relates to the second part of your question on kind of what we're seeing in spots, we saw those continue to decline. Can't really say and I don't want to predict what the future is, so I don't know that we've officially reached bottom yet. I would say that it's somewhat stabilized in the more recent periods of weeks. But we also see other indices, for example, the AOTVI that would suggest that volume trends have continued to decelerate in October versus what we saw in September. And so that's where paying attention to every data point we can to try and get a read. The best thing that we can do is just stay as close to our customers to try and promote and grow on the contractual business side so that we're not as volatile per se in the spot market, and that's what our focus is going into bid season."

            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will be brief and will cover our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis. I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans. Overall, we are pleased with the results of the quarter on a consolidated basis. As John remarked, we hit targets in areas of our business and fell short in others, but that highlights the benefits of our diversified and complementary model. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 22% year-over-year, operating income grew 32% and GAAP earnings per share grew 37%. From a cost perspective, we continue to experience inflationary pressures across most areas of our business but primarily around labor, equipment, including both parts and labor and in the area of claims. We are keeping a close eye on receivables, credit and bad debt as economic conditions change and we'll continue to monitor the environment and manage accordingly. We purchased just shy of 350,000 shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date spend on repurchases to approximately $300 million. We will continue to explore share repurchases going forward as opportunities are presented, and we remain committed to buybacks as a capital management tool with support from our Board. Our balance sheet remains strong with net leverage moderately below our target of 1x trailing 12 months EBITDA. During the quarter, we paid off $350 million of senior notes and entered into a new $1.5 billion credit facility, increasing our flexibility and overall liquidity for future needs. On net CapEx, we spent just over $1 billion year-to-date and expect to fall short about $1.5 billion plan for the year. Our capital expenditures in the future will largely be dependent upon business needs, but levels may remain elevated as our replacement needs are high, given equipment delivery delays and supply chain constraints experienced over the last two years. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments and update you on other areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as we added more than 450 trucks to the fleet during the quarter. While our backlog remains strong, we have some moderation to more normalized levels after two years of significantly above-normal trends. We sold approximately 280 trucks' worth of new business during the course of the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total just shy of 1,700 trucks. As a reminder, this is well above our long-term guidance of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks per year through just the first three quarters of the year. The performance of the business continues to meet expectations as mature accounts are managed diligently and start-up accounts are progressing as expected. We continue to see pressure on equipment and maintenance-related expenses and that remains an area of focus. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and remain excited about executing our plan to grow the business as we deliver exceptional value to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile. As we've discussed for the last several quarters, our focus has been on delivering exceptional service but ensuring the quality revenue aligned with the value we deliver to customers. While much work has been done, I am pleased with the progress. Much work remains though. Overall, we saw good demand for Final Mile Services in the quarter in our off-price retail channel with fulfillment as well as the appliance and furniture delivery market. Similar to DCS, the sales activity is moderating some and we will manage accordingly. Going forward, we remain focused on our profit improvement initiatives while investing in a differentiated service experience for our customers to deliver value to each of them. Closing with some general comments on operations. We have seen improvements in the areas around professional driver recruiting and retention, although at elevated cost. That said, we have not seen much improvement in equipment availability, which continues to put pressure on our maintenance costs. We are still holding trades on several thousand trucks, which were required to support our growth over the last two years. We will make progress in this area over the next year, but we will be dependent upon how much equipment is needed to support our growth. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren. That's a good question. I would say typically, if our sales volume slows down, our start-ups diminish, you would see our margins improve. But we're facing a couple of headwinds. One, fuel cost is up and that dilutes our margin a little bit. But additionally, our maintenance cost is sky high because of all the growth we've added. We've kept trucks longer and so that's increased our maintenance. If I felt that we could get that fixed next year, I would say yes. But in talking with the manufacturers, and we're even adding a third OEM to our mix to try to help us, we're not going to have it solved as they see demand going forward. So we're going to be carrying used trucks all through next year, not to the level this year. So normal times, yes, but this is still abnormal just because of carrying trucks and the price of fuel. Yes. Thank you. I'll take that. Most of our business, I believe the exact number is about 78% of our business in Dedicated is tied to some index or some contractual annual increase, and we've been very successful in getting those. And in addition to the ones that do not have indexes, we were able to get rates this year as needed for driver pay and various things. So what the spot market does up and down doesn't really affect us. It may change while we sell because there's a lot of capacity demands that we see, but we sign up long-term deals. And so when we sell those, the way we sell those, it's for the long term, not quarter-to-quarter or anything like that. So we view it as having very little impact on us from the spot market."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. First off, I'd like to start by saying how humbled and excited I am to be stepping into this new role at J.B. Hunt. Over the years, you've heard me talk about various areas of the business that I've had the honor to lead. I approach this new position with the same passion for our people, all nearly 38,000 employees at J.B. Hunt, and for delivering exceptional service and value to our customers. As John spoke about some of the current indicators that are present in our industry, I want to remind everyone of our say/do culture. And with that, let me share with you what our go-does or priorities are right now for us as an organization. Over my 28 years at the company, I've been fortunate to have worked with some great leaders. As I sit here today, I'm reminded of a saying our Chairman would say and that is, don't starve your opportunities. As an organization, we recognize unique and significant opportunities in the marketplace that have been and are being presented to us. As a result, we will remain committed to disciplined investments in our company foundations, which I spoke to last quarter. That is our people you trust, technology that empowers and capacity to deliver. When we make the right investments in the right people, give them the proper tools to equip and empower them to deliver value and exceptional service to our customers, all of our stakeholders should reap the benefit. So priority one: remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in and for our future growth, and that starts first and foremost with our people. Over the last two months or so, I've traveled and met with our people in the field and across the organization, and I asked each of them the same question, how can you, in your role, drive more value for our customers? I'm encouraged by the feedback I received, the energy of our people and the rallying around just that simple question. As an organization, we need to deliver the greatest value to our customers by providing unmatched service at a fair and equitable return. So much across our organization goes into that equation from being cost competitive, being quick to adapt, making the customer experience exceptional and making sure we are in a position to say yes to our customers' growing needs. So priority number two: deliver exceptional value for our customers across the entire organization. Finally, I believe in something John has always shared with us, and that is growth is oxygen. It provides opportunities for our people in the organization to also grow, develop and build meaningful and lasting careers. We have a deep and tenured bench of talent across our organization who are leading and developing our future leaders. Having a disciplined approach to our capital allocation process supports and funds the investments we make in our people, technology and capacity to better serve our customers. This recipe should continue to support our future growth and value we create for our shareholders. So I'll leave you with one last priority to deliver strong value for our shareholders. As John alluded to in his comments, we see further evidence of a shift in marketplace dynamics that will require us to remain fluid in our approach to managing our business. We often reference that word throughout the pandemic as challenges and uncertainties were present, which feels appropriate at this time as well. Our business leaders will cover our plans with you in more detail. And that concludes my comments, so I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. Allison, we've been using a keyword here really since the pandemic started, and that word has been fluid. And that has been as our customers have been uncertain as to what the future has either been held for them or will be held for them in moving forward. They've really struggled to find out what was going to happen from a labor perspective, what would happen certainly with the rail congestion that you've heard Darren talk about. But also just overall from a consumer perspective, what people would be buying and how to put inventory in the right places. I think we've done a great job over the last nearly three years of making sure that we stay fluid. We stay fluid in our conversations with our customers, and that's going to continue. As you heard John mentioned in the prepared remarks, and then you've heard that throughout each of the segment presidents, we're going to continue to stay focused on creating value for our customers. We're going -- I've stated several times that I believe that the supply chain is the most inefficient at least that I can remember in several years. A big part of that's been from the pandemic. So we're going to be focused on taking costs out of the equation for our customers across all five of our segments where we can do that and sharing back with our customers in that cost while continuing to maintain our margin targets within each of the five different segments. So that fluid response to our customers, we're having to adapt more quickly, be more agile to the process. Our capital allocation process will continue to follow the exact same way that we have done over the last five years. But it will be with what I would tell you from a people and overall capacity perspective. We've been very offensive over the last year or two, making sure that we are prepared and ready for our customers. This is going to give us a chance to take a little bit more of a breadth and be a little more structured discipline, staying in tune and in line with what the market is doing. Ken, it's Shelley... Ken, it's Shelley. Let me add one thing to that well. I think you heard Darren earlier -- you heard Darren say earlier that ROIC is our focus. And we've made sure through 2021 and 2022 that for our customers, that they could have an indifferent answer if they were to hold our boxes. And so for us, from a return perspective, us bringing that equipment, if you think about the problems we had from a railroad congestion and also from our customers not being able to unload our equipment, I think I would suggest that our volumes would be negative at this point based on those two factors. So us bringing in that equipment, being ready and prepared from an ROIC perspective, we are in an in and indifferent position. And so that allows to lean forward. Knowing that our customers' inventory issues and the rail congestion would be shorter term in nature, it would prepare us better for our long term. Knowing that we have such a great target and converting freight off the highway into the most efficient land transportation in North America. Thanks, Ravi. I might try to take both of those. Let me just talk a little bit about the opportunities that we have. I think as the market is moving and our fluid approach, we recognized in some of the areas that we've invested in heavily, there's some rightsizing that we have to do. Brad talked a little bit about that in being more offensive with our customers and trying to make sure we're set up from a sales perspective, but then also looking at what is the five-year plan around that business and making sure that we're more in tune with what the model would suggest. There are other areas of opportunity like what's happening in our maintenance. And that number for us, the amount of trucks that we actually have that we are holding is becoming more and more impactful to our bottom line. But it is allowing us to serve customers and we're staying in line with our customers from a price perspective. I think each one of the five segments have recognized where their opportunities are. Nick, I know, talked about Final Mile also in the beginning with our cost recovery efforts. And I was just making sure that the great value we create for our customers that we're in alignment from a return perspective. And that's going to take us more than a quarter or even more than a few quarters. That's a longer-term strategy for us with our customers walking each 1 independently through that. So I feel like that is really our greatest opportunity. I might add this. What I'm most excited about, our biggest opportunity is really to get the entire organization to understand the level of value we can create for our customers with our mode-agnostic approach. We have the best opportunity of anyone to give a customer an answer that is best for them in cost, service and capacity because we serve the entire supply chain in North America. And with five fairly healthy segments now with the growth trajectory, that really has a market for each one of them in a totally different number, totally different size than what it is today, we think we're just getting started. So I think I'm excited about our long-term opportunity for growth while maintaining our margin and being disciplined in the way that we conduct our business. Say that one more time, Ravi. Yes, I would say -- well, I would say we've tried to highlight those. Final Mile is one of the areas that we're focused in on. I think for ICS, staying long-term structured and disciplined in the long-term plan and just making sure our costs stay in line with that long-term plan is those are probably the two areas that would focus. You're welcome. Thank you, and thank you for spending time with us on this quarterly call. I think you heard us talk a lot about the caution that we have. But I want to make sure that I talk about why we've mentioned caution. For us, caution is just a readiness to pivot. It's a readiness to be available for our customers and understanding what's happening in the market and how we can best prepare ourselves and be ready. With the executive management team having over 25 years' experience at J.B. Hunt, I think we've seen this before. We've seen signs similar, and we want to make sure that we can pivot with our customers and make sure that we continue to create great shareholder value. But might I say that this was our best quarter in our history. It is maybe more muted because we think about that readiness that we're attempting to really solve for. It was the best quarter for JBI. It's the first time DCS hit over $100 million in operating income. And so we're proud of the work that we've done. And I think that you see the results overall. And I also think that you see our diversified portfolio and making sure that we are mode-agnostic with our customers. But speaking of our customers, sharing improvements with our customers is good. It's good for them. It's good for our business. And I think that's going to be important for us as we continue to move forward. The supply chain is inefficient, and we want to help it become a more efficient supply chain. We're a growth company. And we have a complete and total understanding of the importance of ROIC. That will be our focus. We want to create more value for our customers by really trusting the people that take care of them every day. And so I close by saying thank you to the nearly 38,000 people. They work hard every single day on behalf of our customers. And we're going to continue to remain disciplined in our approach, but make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that are present with our customers and serving them with more value. With that, looking forward to speaking with you on the next earnings call."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and hello to everyone on the call. I'll review performance of our Intermodal business, including an update on network fluidity and the opportunities we have to deliver exceptional capacity and value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing the performance from the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity continued to support growth in our business despite challenges related to rail velocity, customer unloading activity and overall supply chain uncertainties facing our customers. Volumes for the quarter were up 4% year-over-year and by month were plus 4% in July, plus 6% in August and down 2% in September. Today, so far in October, volumes have rebounded from weaker demand in September. Last quarter, we discussed the challenges we were facing from a rail network velocity perspective, and I expressed confidence and a bit of optimism that it would get better. While we are not back to where we need to be, I am pleased to say that we saw a meaningful improvement in velocity and performance from BNSF as the quarter progressed, but in particular in mid-August and throughout the remainder of the quarter. We continue to work with our primary channel providers at the most senior levels to improve our service quality and reliability, which presents our organization significant opportunities that I will address next. Recognizing John's comments about the shift in market balance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers with our Intermodal service offering. With greater velocity in our network, we are presented with an opportunity to remove meaningful costs in our business due to lack of productivity. As I've said before, our customers will participate in those savings while also benefiting from faster and more reliable service. We think this puts us in a position to be able to deliver meaningful value for our customers as they look for cheaper, more efficient and the most sustainable way of moving their freight. As we stand here today, I'm confident that customers have greater demand for our capacity as speed and reliability improve. And I believe we have a greater line of sight to that now than at any other point over the last two years. In closing, I would like to drive home the point that our business and our rail channel providers all benefit from service quality improvements, and we remain motivated and incentivized to deliver it. We have significant productivity and cost saving opportunities that will present themselves in our dray operations as rail service quality makes further improvements. I look forward to discussing our progress in this area in the quarters ahead. That concludes my prepared remarks so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Okay. First of all, I don't want to spend all afternoon talking about potential rail labor situation. Look, September was obviously impacted by rail labor or the threat of that. Every year, we have network challenges that we don't always call out in these sorts of calls. And in some ways, the results in September was similar to a bad weather event. It was short term in nature. Volumes were improving coming out of August. The rail labor situation was probably one of a couple of several things that might have influenced customers. And that came and went, and volumes recovered back to where they were prior to that. So I do think that customer demand right now is -- was showing improvement in August and it continues to today. As far as pricing goes, I think we're just way too early in the bid cycle to kind of know what to predict there. Obviously, the bid cycle is important to us. We continue to dialogue with our customers about ways that we can take cost out of our system together. And as we have that dialogue, we fully anticipate the customer to get a benefit when we work together to do that. I've said that for the better part of the year now and still believe that strongly. I don't know where to even go next. I'm just going to stop there. Well, certainly, we contemplate the productivity we can generate on a container in a month. That certainly drives some of our thought process. So as we can move more loads on a container in a month as velocity improves, there's some benefit there that we would anticipate sharing with our customers. We're very focused on ROIC-only margin as an output. And as we layer on more volume and look for ways to grow, we would anticipate that there's a benefit in our underlying cost from that. And I would just highlight and tried to in some of the prepared comments, our drayage activity can also get a productivity benefit out of improved rail service. We would anticipate an improvement in the productivity of our drivers and our tractor resources as well as rail service improves. And that, too, is something that we would anticipate our customers can benefit from. Well, I'll start on the bid compliance. I think that somewhere in 2020 and '21, we've highlighted that bid compliance deteriorated from our previous marks and somewhere in the 60% to 70% range of an award. And maybe in prior terms, it would hover between 70% and 80%. I think that your question around spot capacity influencing that, we've been in this 60% to 70% range for the better part of two years. And I would not say that anything this summer or more recent with truckload spot prices falling, impacting customer bid compliance in our Intermodal business. I don't believe we're actually seeing that, so I don't know how much of an influencer that is. Certainly, truckload pricing will always be an influencer to some degree at Intermodal, but it's not the only influencer of it. And to investors concerned about or that to your second question, I would just say, historically, Intermodal prices haven't fallen and haven't moved to the magnitude that truckload rates maybe have at times. And the ability -- what's different this cycle is that ability for us to shed costs that I've highlighted. I mean, I think that the pricing strength of these last 1.5 years of pricing activity is because all of our costs are up so much. And I mean that's J.B. Hunt's cost, that's our rail providers' cost and it certainly is drayage activity in the industry, equipment costs more. It's everywhere you look, there were really significant cost increases. And so to me, that's one of the biggest differences moving forward. How does the industry shed some of that cost? And productivity is a big part of that. So some of our ability to move in that area really depends on how much additional productivity we can get out of our resources, both our assets and our people. Well, I don't know that I can clarify where volumes are running quarter-to-date. What I would just tell you is we saw that -- maybe I'll say it like this. September ran minus 2%. You heard that in my prepared comments. I think that had we not had a disruption from the potential of a rail strike, volumes in September would have been more between 3% and 4% positive. And I think that we're back in line with where we were running throughout the quarter without that disruption. So I'll just answer that question that way. In terms of box turns, for the quarter, box turns were, hang on a sec, 1.5, so nowhere near where we would anticipate or expect our box turns to improve to. We called out that velocity really began to improve in the second half of August and continued to improve throughout September. And I just -- there will be somewhat of a lag as volume -- as velocity improves to the onboarding of new volume that our customers want to see and want to gain confidence in our ability to sustain that velocity and service performance. So we didn't experience any real benefits from that service and velocity improvements during those six weeks in Q3 in terms of volume and you had a lot of noise there that I just mentioned related to volume in September. So as we go through December and as we continue to highlight benefits from faster velocity to our customers and as we go through the bid season, we absolutely do anticipate an improvement in the box turns. So I'd say -- something I haven't really highlighted yet today is just customer inventory levels are higher. And that's certainly influencing some of the demand and ability to process and speed up asset utilization. So that's certainly a factor. I would also highlight that I think throughout the third quarter, international import volumes continued to -- somewhat of a logjam at the ports. But as the quarter progressed, I think a lot of that business has cleaned up. But there still is a lot of noise in the system related to getting cargo out of containers, into warehouses, on shelves, to your home, all of those aspects. But they're -- the biggest factor to me right now is just inventories are elevated, and so customers are working hard to find a place to put inventory. Well, certainly, we onboarded a lot. We announced an expansion of our equipment as we move into the next three to five years. We made that big announcement back in March. We've onboarded equipment as the year has gone on. And certainly, peak season volumes aren't where we would have anticipated them to be just, I don't know, four or five months ago. Certainly would have anticipated stronger volumes. Peak season this year just doesn't appear to be much of an event, I'll just say it like that, while we're still experiencing growth. As we go into next year, onboarding equipment will continue to run at a pace where our growth is supporting. Now as we get velocity improvements, that's unlocking capacity in our existing fleet and will have us really studying how quickly to onboard that equipment as we move into next year. Now at the same time, if it's -- if there's an opportunity to onboard equipment for whatever reason at a cost benefit to us, then we may choose to do that so that we can be a little more agile with our customer demand, to be responsive as we would anticipate some customers to experience challenges related to service that they're receiving from other carriers all trying to find a slot on our competing Western rail carrier. So we do absolutely anticipate an opportunity to grow from that scenario. And having equipment available and ready for that opportunity is one of the core important strategies for our -- the next year. I'm not going to answer margin questions on that, Ken. I'm sorry, it's just not something we're going to do. Okay, I'll try to dive off into your question there, Brian, on Intermodal. I mean, clearly, in those years, 2015 maybe to 2020, you seem to have a lot of focus on whether or not we can grow both volume and price. Prior to that time, I think we had some success with that. And during that time window, there was a lot of choppiness related to our relationship with BNSF. There was PSR implementation, which in some ways, shifted some challenges from the railroads out to us. So just a lot of challenges related there. And as we move into the future, I think our relationship with BNSF has never been stronger, and we feel very confident about the work that they are doing, and we are doing together to grow our Intermodal product. We would anticipate that the value proposition we deliver to our customers is also driving enough value to warrant the quality returns that both BNSF and J.B. Hunt would expect. All that being said, does that mean we get a rate increase? I don't know. I know that expansion of their footprint is good for our Intermodal business. And so we're very excited about all the projects that they have underway. And certainly transload opportunities are big for us and will continue to be important strategies that we work on together with the railroad."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. As we reflect on the performance of the overall business in the third quarter, we echo many of the same themes discussed on our last call with an intense focus on changes in the freight markets we serve. The results in many areas of our business achieved appropriate targets in light of the cyclical shift in market balance I've referenced last quarter. While some improvement has been seen in rail service and company hiring challenges in particular with our driver force, we continue to face difficulties in equipment availability for growth and replacement, along with the uncertainty of the direction of macro conditions. Clearly, there are also areas of our business with opportunity for correction. That said, let me be clear, the businesses we've built, the changes we've implemented and the team's collective experience have and will continue to reveal themselves as value-enhancing catalysts for our customers, our company and our shareholders. Let me address some of the points around the market dynamics referenced. Further evidence has presented itself over the course of the quarter that requires an increased level of caution and awareness on broader demand trends and economic activity. Data, experience and frequent dialogue with our customers will continue to guide us in this area. The complementary nature and diversification of our businesses will continue to serve us well in this changing market. As mentioned earlier, rail service has shown real signs of improvement in both velocity and reliability during the quarter with positive momentum building, the most notable increase coming from our friends at the BNSF. We are encouraged by the trends and Darren will expand on this area in his remarks. I remain in active and regular dialogue with the senior leaders of our primary rail channels on opportunities and investments required to fully restore service levels needed to capture the opportunities presented with Intermodal. We are optimistic about the path forward with Intermodal and with all aspects of our collective services. Members of our leadership team are here and will cover areas of our business more specifically for you. But at this point, I would like to turn the call over for the first time to our new President, Ms. Shelley Simpson. Shelley? Balance over there. And Ken, I'm just going to add also to give Darren a breather so he can catch a drag in between questions. He said it best. Just keep in mind where we get these boxes currently and the difficulty in getting them here. And so we have to plan accordingly to be able to be nimble. The other thing, as these are 20-year assets, they're priced and modeled from an ROIC perspective to include downturns throughout those 20 years. And so all of that is kind of taken into consideration in terms of our ability to go out and buy and add those units."

My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines have been muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end.  I now have the pleasure to hand you the conference over to our host, Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance with J.B. Hunt. Brad, please proceed.\nBrad Delco: Good afternoon.

This afternoon, I am joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services. At this time, I would like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening remarks. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter despite challenges around key factors of our business, including labor, equipment availability, and rail service. The quarter did present evidence of a cyclical shift in market balance in certain areas of our business, and we see macrodata that informs us about our current position, such as spot rates and used truck values. That said, and most importantly, our results for the quarter continue to reveal the changes we have worked to implement to enhance our position in each segment of the company based on lessons learned and experiences gained over many, many years and cycles. There are different characteristics of our business segments that should be complementary to the needs of our customers in all economic conditions. These include a flexible, much lighted asset position in our highway services offerings, compelling solutions for private fleet conversions aiding in the nuances of managing advanced transportation networks, a more economical and carbon-friendly full-load services offering in Intermodal, and a Final Mile delivery position that addresses a   growing demand channel, we remain in a leadership position across our many businesses, and from a position of strength financially and on the teams' experience and ability to navigate through an ever-changing, constantly evolving global supply chain, I am encouraged to be in healthy, cash-generating businesses across the company. Let me address the clear service challenges we are experiencing with our rail providers. We are in active discussions with the highest levels of our primary rail providers to continue our work on improving service reliability and velocity. We remain confident that the right decisions and investments will be made to bring us back to where we need to be. We remain committed to the path we are on with Intermodal, and have made no changes to our plans with the expectations for the noted improvements to show through in the second-half of this year. In fact, at this point, we have made no alterations to our plans for the year in our equipment and capital expenditure allocations. While we acknowledge there are timing and delivery challenges, we take a long view and know that we have extended needs in all categories for replacement and growth assets. This position recognizes so-called crosswinds we are experiencing, as noted, and will be covered more during this call. Our direction is fully informed using real-time data on all key aspects of each business and input from our customers. Our leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his thoughts on the quarter. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis. And I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans and our priorities for capital. Overall, we are pleased with the strong results the team was able to deliver in the quarter, highlighted with revenue growth of 32%, operating income growth of 46%, and GAAP earnings per share growth of 50%. We did incur two large but partially off-setting income statement items in the quarter. First, we incurred a $30 million increase in casualty claims, which is recorded in the insurance and claims line of our income statement. And second, we recorded an $11.6 million workers compensation insurance benefit in the salaries, wages, and benefits, line. We've discussed the net impact of $18.4 million in our release, and provided the net impact by segment in those respective sections. We were equally pleased with our efforts, and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with leverage below our net debt target of one times EBITDA on a trailing 12-months basis. We ended the quarter with $124 million of cash, and zero drawn on our revolving credit facility.  , our $350 million 2022 notes, which are in the coming quarter, and we are reviewing our plans to retiring these notes, but are not concerned on liquidity matters given our options. On CapEx, we continue to be slightly behind our plans of $1.5 billion that we forecasted for the year. But as John alluded to you, we remain committed to that target for both replacement and growth needs to service and growth with customers. The lag in CapEx versus plan is almost entirely due to challenges in obtaining equipment. As a reminder, our priorities for our capital remain focused on building long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, and our people. We're able to accomplish this by remaining disciplined and allocating our capital to generate fair and reasonable returns to support reinvestment in our business, which remains priority number one. We bought back almost one million shares of stock in the quarter as opportunities were presented, and remain committed to buybacks and dividends as a capital management tool, as supported by our Board. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Thanks, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will cover current market conditions, and how we continue to have confidence in our position across our scroll of services to provide value for our customers. I'll also provide an update on our priorities across the key areas of our business which are our people, technology, and capacity, and how the combination of all three allow us to differentiate ourselves and in delivering exceptional value to our customers. The freight market remains dynamic, and continues to be presented with unique and evolving challenges at different cross-sections of the broad supply chain. Labor availability, network velocity and fluidity, in addition to varying inventory dynamics around product mix continue to put strain on the effective utilization of available capacity. Some trends we identified last quarter, like a softer transactional spot market remain, but also remains is a healthy demand for our Intermodal capacity and our professionally outsourced product fleet solution in DCS, and the frictionless way we connect customers with capacity in our highway services businesses by leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. The businesses we are in today across our entire scroll were not built or created overnight. Careful thought, planning, and execution, with durability, strength of financial discipline were, and remain top of mind. We do recognize that broader demand trends are a concern, and we continue to have frequent and open dialogue with our customers regarding their capacity needs. We remain optimistic on our ability to compete to deliver the best value to our customers by offering a full suite of services across the scroll that can help eliminate waste, create efficiencies, and drive out costs from the system. Last quarter, I said our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers is greater this year than at any point over the last two, and that remains true today. Freight has been moving inefficiently, creating additional cost, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity to eliminate waste in the system. Enhanced visibility, powered by the largest multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360, remains a tremendous opportunity for customers to effectively source their capacity needs. During the quarter, we launched new foundational principles that helps define who we are as a company, what we strive for on behalf of our customers, and what our employees should expect as a member of our organization. In fact, our innovative, entrepreneurial, and say-do culture is founded on these principles; people you trust, technology that empowers, and capacity to deliver. That is J.B. Hunt. It is by no accident that people comes first. As it is, it remains our top priority to take care of our people who take care of and deliver value for our customers. We empower our people, our organization, and our customers with investments in technology to help provide productivity and efficiencies in our collective processes. And finally, we continue to invest in our capacity to deliver on meeting the growing needs of our customers. I'll close in a similar fashion as I did last quarter, we believe our mode in different approach allows us to provide flexible solutions to dynamically meet and respond to the needs of our customers. Our investments in our people, technology and physical capacities have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in the three key areas of cost, capacity, and service. That concludes my comments. And I'd now like to turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments, and provide an update on our professional drivers and equipment, and the impact that is having on our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as evidenced by our continued growth in our fleet during the quarter. Our backlog and pipeline also remained strong. After selling 600 trucks in Q1, we sold slightly over 800 trucks in the second quarter. We talked last quarter about seeing solid momentum in the business, and that remains the case today as we continue to onboard new business. We've added nearly 2,200 trucks to our business in the last 12 months, which continues to stand out versus the competition. This unprecedented demand and growth for our highly engineered Fleet Service has put a strain on the organization, and the team has responded extremely well to the challenge. Going forward, we will remain focused on operational excellence, attracting and retaining the best talent and executing our growth plan, which all supports the value we deliver to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile, as we discussed earlier this year, our focus for '22 has been on revenue quality and making sure our investments in our differentiated service product is properly valued in the marketplace, I'm pleased with our efforts and the success we've had so far to improve our profitability. But more work remains and remains a priority moving forward. We continue to see strong demand for our service with new customer opportunities in the pipeline. But we also have seen some softening demand in some end markets, mainly in the value furniture category. Our recent acquisition, Zenith Freight Lines is performing well and is presenting good opportunities for future growth. Zenith contributed about $28 million of revenue in the quarter. Going forward, we will remain committed to providing an unmatched service in the industry and we continue to make investments to support that effort. We believe this will support our long-term performance in this second leg growing piece of the supply chain. Closing with some general comments on operations, the driver market remains competitive and challenging, but it feels more stable than it has in a while but at considerably higher cost. That said, the equipment market remains extremely challenging and we are having to manage intensely around the impact on our operations. To support our replacement needs in the growth we've seen across our organization, we will be holding trades on roughly 4,000 tractors this year. Additionally, inflationary cost pressures on tires, parts, maintenance technicians are meaningful. And the higher frequency of repairs as a result of an ageing fleet is also impacting the utilization of our tractor equipment. We continue to work closely with our OEM providers to secure the safest and most fuel efficient equipment we can in the most expeditious way possible. That concludes my remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review performance of our Intermodal segment. I will also give you an update on current network dynamics, customer demand and capacity. I'll start by reviewing the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for our capacity continues to be greater than our ability to serve that demand. After seeing modest improvements in both rail velocity and customer activity in the first quarter, we saw performance deteriorate throughout the second quarter. Box turns in the quarter were essentially flat versus the first quarter and underperformed our expectations. That said, volumes by month for the quarter were up 4% in April, up 9% in May and up 10% in June on a year-over-year basis. We took delivery of an additional 1,300 containers in the quarter and expect to take delivery of more in the second-half of the year as we continue to invest in capacity to meet the needs of our customers, while our network velocity and resulting volume performance were disappointing in the quarter, the system and programs we have in place continue to protect the significant investments we've made on behalf of our customers. As we sit here today, we remain optimistic that rail performance and velocity will improve as the rails are not incentivized to move slower, near and long-term growth opportunities for Intermodal business continue to be in front of us and our rail channel partners are well aware of those opportunities. As John mentioned, we are working closely with all levels of our rail channel partners to address the velocity challenges. Starting early next year as new capacity becomes available to us on BNSF, we fully anticipate filling that available capacity, which is supported by feedback from our customers. When rail velocity does improve, we fully expect to improve available capacity but also demand for that available capacity as service levels improves. As inefficiencies are removed from the network, we fully expect that to be reflected in our cost to serve customers and rightfully so in the cost to our customers. In closing, our Intermodal product continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with significant capacity to serve their needs in a more sustainable, efficient and carbon friendly way. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our long-term growth and to better serve our customer needs. We believe our service backed by our people, and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market, and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call highway services. While we did see a market shift in the quarter, specifically related to spot opportunities, we believe our investments in our people, technology and assets helped us deliver a great and demanded service from our customers, which I'll touch on at the end of my comments. But first let's start in ICS, ICS top line revenue growth was 3% comprised of a 3% decline in volume more than offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. Unpacking that a little more, our truckload volumes were also down about 3%. But this was largely a function of the shift I referenced earlier, our contractual truckload business increased in upper teens percent year-over-year, while our spot business was down mid-teams on a year-over-year basis. We made a call earlier this year to focus on the public side of our business, which we believe was the right strategic move. That said, we did adjust the dials mid-quarter on some of our platform parameters, and saw improvement in spot rate and freight trends as the quarter progressed, we will continue to target the right and appropriate balance between volume growth and profitability and our goal remains to outperform industry trends over the long-term on growth but more importantly, on delivering value to customers. I am confident with the power of our people and the technology investments in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to drive increased efficiency and value in our service offering to help us deliver our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. Shifting over to truckload, we continue to see evidence of our customers valuing our drop trailer network service offering. Volume growth of 14% in the quarter supports that view, we see tremendous opportunity, as customers begin to think differently about the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs. We believe that we have the right experience managing trailing assets and a complex network business. We've gained that experience on our Intermodal business, but in this instance, leveraging all the capacity and capability of our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity for our customers versus the rail network. This shift from an asset intensive to an asset light model supports our goal of scaling a large business with fair and acceptable rates of return on our capital. In closing, I would just like to reiterate our strong belief that the blending of what has historically been separate networks, live load and unload freight versus dropped trailer, freight remains and strong demand and is valued by our customers. We remain committed to investment in our people, technology and assets to support this growth. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to Brad to give some instructions before the Operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thanks, Brad. And I just want to remind the audience if you don't mind, please ask one question and get back in queue. We have a lot of folks on the call this afternoon. So, with that, I'll turn it back to the Operator, Amber. Thank you.\nOperator: Of course, thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session.  Our first question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc. Todd, your line is now open.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good afternoon. So, I guess maybe to start, I don't know if this is for Shelley or maybe John Roberts, if you wanted to take a stab at this, but maybe to help level-set kind of some of the commentary that you have around the demand environment. Certainly, we appreciate that there's a lot of crosscurrents that are out there, but as you think about the progression into the second-half of this year, I'm just curious, are the indications that you're expecting a weaker environment in the second-half relative to where we were in the first-half based on customer feedback? Any color around the fall peak would be helpful? And then any potential pricing conversations or impact on pricing based on the change in demand environments right now? Thanks.\nShelley Simpson: Okay, thank you, Todd. I think you gave me three questions. So, I'm going to do my best to answer them as best as possible. So -- \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nTodd Fowler: That was Todd Flower, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nShelley Simpson: We are having really good conversation with our customers, that I think, not unlike what's happened in the pandemic the last two years, there is continuing to be challenges in the supply chain that are creating uncertainty in the market, in particular with our customers around inventory, which is really generated from consumer behavior. But just also the bottlenecks that are occurring from port activity to, we talked in our last call what was happening coming out of China. And then certainly what's happening still with labor at each part of the supply chain in general. So, I would tell you, I think we're having a seasonally normal July that might be the first July that we've seen in a seasonality perspective since COVID had started. We do think that there will be a peak. To what extent, we're still not sure. We feel confident in the different areas of our businesses and how we've having conversation with our customers. If we were to think about from a pricing perspective, we're pretty much finished with bid season, and we're going to be entering into new bid season here in a couple of months. So, our pricing is pretty much set across all of our businesses except for what's happening in the spot market in total. I think our customers are trying to understand what's happening in cost. I have talked about our transitory cost versus our structural cost challenges, and we are trying to get them up to speed, where there is transitory cost and we can start helping them create a more efficient supply chain. So, I think it's -- we haven't even started bid season and what's coming in the next couple of months, but I would say, I think our customers are prepared to have a good second-half. I haven't had a lot of feedback on a significant downturn. I will say inventory has had some short-term challenges and changes for our customers, going all the way upstream in the supply chain, but those are supposed to be more short-term than they are long-term. And, Nick, did you have something to say?\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I was just going to say, in our dedicated business, as we watch our load count in the day, which is basically from the warehouse to the store, our volume is up and trending up. So, it's looking good from that standpoint. So, we're still seeing consumer demand strong, and that's -- we're closest to that.\nTodd Fowler: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Ken, your line is now open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. So, and just -- John, I guess, great job on Intermodal. Maybe can you talk a bit about -- more about the rail service and if loads are up 8% while there are service levels, I think you said we're flattish, how we should think about that? Are you starting to see an improvement, your thoughts on outlook into the second-half as you go into peak? And then same thing on price, right, can you delineate maybe the excess pricing from that poor rail service, because you mentioned as the service gets better you could see pricing then come down for customers, maybe talk about how we should think about in terms of the price impact? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow: Well, let me start on service. We talked about velocity, actually deteriorated some during the second quarter. We know that none of our rail providers are satisfied with their operations today. I think the intensity at all of our rail providers is extraordinarily high today in all efforts to onboard new crews, and find a pathway to a better service product. I think that, collectively, us and our rail providers all understand that there's additional demand, additional revenue, additional volume waiting on us to improve our service. And I think that that's universally understood. And I do anticipate that we're going to see some improvements during the second-half of the year. The key question is when. And I don't have a great answer for that. I mean, I really think the railroads will have to answer that question. But we're confident in the programs they're initiating, and we are confident that they will see improvements as the year continues. I think all we tried to highlight on the pricing front is there's accessorial programs out there for delays at customers, those certainly are areas where that's cost to remove from the customers as velocity improves. But in addition to that, equipment ownership is not cheaper today; it's more expensive than ever to buy equipment. And so, when the rail velocity improves, really our industry, I would think J.B. Hunt and all Intermodal channels will have a slight pickup in equipment costs there. And certainly we would anticipate at least some of those would be passed along to the customers.\nKen Hoexter: Right. Appreciate the time, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison, your line is now open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good evening. So, can you touch on -- with J.B. Hunt 360, can you touch on where you think we are in the growth and evolution of that product offering, particularly as we think to that downside scenario? And then somewhat associated with that, within ICS, kind of similarly, how we should think that that gross margin range through cycle, just any thoughts there?\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Allison, this is Brad Hicks. Thank you for the question. And when I think about 360, we're very public about the investments we made in '18 and '19, really leading into '20. We do continue to invest in 360 to expand its capabilities and the value that it can create on behalf of both our customers as well as our carriers. But by and large, the -- I guess the foundation of that platform, I would say, is behind us. But that's not to say that we won't continue to make investments and find ways to improve upon it. And then, remind me again part two of your question?\nAllison Poliniak: And just within ISC, is there a gross margin range that we should be thinking through particularly as we think about the downside scenario just in that segment, around this?\nBrad Hicks: Yes, certainly. Thank you for the reminder. We certainly saw margins expand dramatically in the second quarter with the pressure that had been placed predominantly in the spot and where we were at relative to the bid cycle with publish rates. Is that the peak? Hard to say, and I think it's still too early to tell. Certainly, PTE has come down, but it is still well north of historical or pre-COVID levels. Obviously, Shelley mentioned there are some structural costs that probably remain. But we'll just have to see what the second-half holds around capacity versus supply. But certainly, we were able to take advantage of the expanded margins, as you can see in our results for the second quarter, we were pleased by that, and we feel like we managed through that pivot in an appropriate way.\nAllison Poliniak: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Ravi, your line is now open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for the time. The insurance claim that you had of $30 million in the quarter, can you elaborate on that a little bit more and help us understand if this was a one-time thing related to the quarter, a loan or some kind of incident, or is it an ongoing item? Thank you.\nJohn Kuhlow: Hey, Ravi. This is John Kuhlow; I'll address the one-time charge. We tend to try to avoid calling -- referring things as one-time, but this one was a charge that we had incurred in the quarter for claims that result -- or were part of prior year. There were two or three claims that are going to settle or have settled outside of our coverage limits in one of the towers. And so, again, everything is part of the business, but these related to prior periods.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Scott, your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, afternoon. So, as you start planning for the upcoming bid season, would you expect to see a divergence in Intermodal and truckload pricing or would you think that they would sort of trend directionally together? And then maybe just separately for Nick on the dedicated side, so the growth really kicked in, in second quarter last year. I'm just wondering, a year later, all those trucks that you had, and how are those performing relative to the margin targets?\nDarren Field: Yes, okay, Scott, Darren here. I'll handle Intermodal first. I think, certainly, this massive change in spot prices that's evident out there feels like it is putting a little bit of pressure on Intermodal. But I don't know that I think it's this overwhelming influencer as highway capacity is still not typically the largest competitor to Intermodal out West. Typically, we're competing against all water costs or certainly other Intermodal channels or intact channels. And those costs will drive the Intermodal market, and then the underlying rail costs are doing to be the biggest influencers, far more than what is going on with truckload pricing. Now in the East, certainly highway rates can play in a real influence on our ability to convert business off the highway to Intermodal. All that being said, with fuel prices where they are, and with velocity being challenged to this point, I think we feel like preparing for the next round we should see velocity improvements which can translate to value for customers that Intermodal can provide when compared against the highway. So, I think there will be some convergence, meaning if trends in highway published prices are to trend flat or certainly slow or even take a tick down, certainly the Intermodal market will have to respond. But I think the cost, the underlying cost structure of Intermodal, really for all the channels, is a little bit different than what it is on the highway.\nBrad Hicks: Yes, Scott, this is Brad. I would just mention maybe from a highway standpoint, I think it would be safe to anticipate that there would be flat-to-downward pressure, at least in the shorter-term. What does that mean going into all of 2023? I think it's entirely too early to really tell. I think that we'll know a lot more as we get deeper into fall in terms of understanding what demand looks like relative to supply. But, certainly, we anticipate maybe some flat-to-down pressure, and from a pure highway standpoint.\nNick Hobbs: All right, Scott, this is Nick. To your question, I am looking at the entire book of '21 adds for us, and it's operating within 20 basis points of our base business that's been around for a long time. So, it is doing very well, that's including deals that started up in November and December. So, we're very pleased with that, and it's hitting our targets.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Maybe a question for Darren, I wanted to get a sense of Intermodal container additions through the rest of the year. Is 2Q sort of a good proxy to use for quarterly growth going forward? And in maybe bigger picture, are there challenges to continuing to add to the fleet if rail service doesn't get better? So, obviously, you've been pretty successful adding to fleet, and we haven't seen really much improvement in rail service, so maybe that's the answer. But kind of curious about how you think about continuing to grow the fleet, and if we're not going to get a pickup here over the course of the next several months or into the back-half of the year, are there other challenges or cost dynamics that start to crop up as a result of that? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Sure. So, well, we ended the quarter just above 110,000 containers, and we're often marching on our announced plan to expand our capacity up to 150,000 over the next three to five years. So, with only 1,300 ads in Q2 of this year, I think we would fall well short of that plan, if that is what we do. As velocity changes come about, and there's opportunities for us to gain capacity with the equipment we already own, we will adapt our pace of onboarding that equipment based on customer demand and what's going on in the market. I don't want to say that it's just going to be steady flow and will always be exactly the same. I don't think it will be but it would be certainly our opportunity to try to grow into new capacity that came from velocity improvements. But at this point, probably announcements related to our equipment will continue to just land on that march towards 150,000. And obviously, each quarter, you'll be able to see what we added, we would prefer to it to be steady, but at the same time we have to adapt and we know that ROIC will always be our Northstar and will guide us through that process. And we'll continue with the flexibility that we need to be prudent with as stewards of those investments.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Chris, it's Shelley. Just one thing to note there is we do have a unique opportunity in January where we will have more capacity on our Western Railroad providers. So, I think we're trying to equally balance the challenges of getting more Intermodal containers to move in the system, and the opportunity that will be present here in short order. So, our conversations with customers are going well around the Western network. And so, for us will be more surgical as to where we can grow. But think about our performance in the second quarter, we did a really great job, even through the challenges growing with our customers on lanes that made sense for the railroad for our customer and ourselves. And we'll continue to do that. So, I think it's going to be important that we continue to onboard equipment as we see room for growth for ourselves.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Amit, your line is now open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. I guess I just had a couple of quick questions. One is wanted to understand the implications from AB5 potentially being implemented, my feeling is as it relates to the Intermodal business, it could be a pretty decent market share opportunity given you in-source the vast majority of your trade drivers, I think your competitors do not. So, if you can just talk about if AB5 is implemented or executed, what the implications are for the industry overall and specifically how J.B. Hunt's position in that and then, Darren, I was hoping you could update us on the joint initiative with BNSF, I saw the Intermodal, the transload facility I think you guys put up a few days ago in the press release, would just love to get an update on what BNSF the progress that they've made in terms of giving you a little bit more clear access to capacity, if that's being implemented now or is that sort of more to come that can maybe drive a step function improvement in the terms of the volumes?\nNick Hobbs: Yes, Amit, it's Nick, I'll take the first on AB5. And we've been watching that since basically 2018 and we feel like we're in a really good spot with that. We don't expect the new law to have an immediate or material effect on our California operations. We discontinued a few years ago, our use of independent contractors operating under our authority. And so, out there, we provide either J.B. Hunt employees or we use brokerage to other motor carriers. So, we feel very confident that it's not going to interrupt our business and probably play into our strengths particularly out in the Intermodal side.\nDarren Field: Yes, Amit I think I heard you say that you thought that we outsource more of our drayage activity than\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nAmit Mehrotra: Insource, insource?\nDarren Field: Yes, you did it right, I'm sorry I didn't hear that right, just going to clean that up, if I didn't hear that right appreciate. So, yes, we don't feel like AB5 is going to be an influencer of our operation in any way. So, as it relates to all things joint efforts with BNSF, I think that our mission today continues to be probably more focused on elements beginning next year. I mean, frankly there's not new capacity announcements that have come from BNSF yet, as soon as something like that is available, I'm sure you'll read it, we still feel very confident in the way that we are communicating with BNSF on all things capacity. But I think that you should all anticipate and expect it right now. We're very focused on seeing velocity improvements and just service improvements in our system and that's dominating our conversations today.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Jon, your line is now open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Nick, I think this question is for you, but others can chime in as they see fit. I mean, you have a pretty unique look at two massive parts of the transportation chain with rail and truck. And on the one hand, you still have this elevated contract rate in this very high fuel. On the other hand, you've had spot turning over in the rail service issues. And I know we're hopeful for velocity improvements. I think we were very hopeful of that in April as well. As you look at your mode in different way of servicing customers, is there a point where maybe you're concerned that the Intermodal kind of permanent modal shift has missed this opportunity, missed this window and if so, how do you kind of position all the different segments of J.B. Hunt whether that's a capital dollars or labor, et cetera to kind of shift gears pretty quickly if Intermodal is never going to really dream the dream?\nShelley Simpson: Well, Jon, this is Shelley, I have a higher voice than Nick, but I would say our opportunity with our customers, we are mode indifferent. And so, understanding their needs specifically is important in how we develop what our strategy is, and how we deploy capital as a result, much like what John Kuhlow talked about in his opening remarks. For us, we think that Intermodal will continue to deliver great value for our customers, and we're bullish on our growth plan in our Intermodal segment, but we're bullish in our growth plan across all of our segments over the long-term. So, for us, we think that there are some short term pains that have felt longer-term, but we do think that there is a window of opportunity here where the rails will get better, our customers will get better, inventory will get to right locations, and the supply chain will start to find a better balance, if you will. And we think having all five of our segments that really take product from the very beginning of the supply chain all the way in to the final home of our consumer will yield ourselves well in an environment that is more normalized and for our customers will be able to say, \"Yes, anytime they need it.\" Each one of those segments has different margin targets and returns inside their own area. But we do see great growth across all five channels and Intermodal being one of our strongest growth vehicles over the next several years.\nJon Chappell: Okay, thank you, Shelley.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Justin, your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks, with the significant run up in fuel prices we've seen recently, I was curious if you could share how much of a sequential headwind that was to margins and then, Nick, the number of dedicated truck sales remains extremely strong despite what's going on with spot rates right now. So, as you reflect on the last couple of years, and the strength that we've seen in dedicated sales, how much of that strength would you say is cyclical versus secular coming from private fleets that are out sourced?\nNick Hobbs: I'll jump in on the dedicated side first, and thinking about that, I would just say that when I look back through our pipeline, it is still at an elevated level, a touch higher than it was this time last year. And so, I think our demand is there. And when I looked through the detail, and we reviewed it the other day, it's a lot of private fleet conversion. So, I think it's just a long-term. We got a lot of density going on right now. And a lot of density kind of helps us, we have good solutions to customers and with Intermodal growing, we have a lot of synergies there. So, I think it's just good momentum. I don't think it's cyclical. And we try to say that we're different than the normal over the road rates, one way rates. And I think this has proven it out. So, that demand is very strong, it will impact.\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Justin, this is Brad, and I'll kind of add a little bit to the fuel question, expecting that and I did some work on there. We talked about it in DCS; it was at least 100 basis point headwinds to margin percent on a year-over-year basis. We also looked at it on a sequential basis. And you would have seen a decent amount of margin improvement sequentially. If you excluded the impact of fuel, you're aware we don't report or margin than a fuel surcharge, like some others in the industry. But it was a headwind of margin. But as a general statement, I did want to say fuel is a pass through for us, and it really shouldn't impact our EBIT dollars. And so, I just want to be consistent with how we've talked about in the past and how we're talking about here. Albeit, we did provide a little bit more color on DCS recently, and I thought I'd just reiterate that.\nJustin Long: That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Jordan, your line is now open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. Curious on the Final Mile business, sort of x the revenue quality initiatives that you guys have been working on? Can you maybe talk to what demand or volume sort of look like in that business? And obviously, it's working a bit because the profit sort of bumped up from the first quarter, so maybe help think through the profitability in that segment looking ahead, thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Yes, so the demand is still strong. It's spotty. And some, as we said, in our press release in the value, furniture side of things, the demand is there, one of the CEOs of one of those companies told me that a year-ago, fish were jumping in, customers were jumping into his boat, six months ago, he had to fish with, I hope with nobody on it. And now he's having to work really hard to get sales. So, that was the analogy there. So, that's for the lower end furniture value side, the other side is really still busy. Inventories are getting corrected. So, we're seeing a lot of demand, we picked up some new business there. And our service is really what's separating us and our background checks. And that seems to be playing well. And you're seeing this quarter, a lot of would put a lot of pressure on rate at existing business. And we were successful in that, we lost some, but we feel good about the locations we lost. So, it's setting up good. And we got some more room to go.\nJordan Alliger: The profit thoughts, though, given the $13 million I think you did in the second quarter?\nJohn Roberts: Yes, I think we're going to see, we're not going to give guidance, but we're happy with where we're at right now.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Jason, your line is now open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, all. Want to focus a little bit on ICS. I think you mentioned, you made some tweaks into quarter and then you gave sort of a number, I think down 3% for volume growth on the truckload side. Could you give us maybe an idea of just the volume improved any after you made those tweaks in the quarter?\nJohn Roberts: Yes, Jason, I think what I wanted to help understand is that we saw a really sharp decline in spot activity throughout the month of April. And finishing up March, as we talked about, our volumes were pretty positive in Q1, but really kind of hit a wall, those first 15 to 18 days of April, then we were at that's when we were able to change some of our parameters and the algorithms that we use and some of our artificial intelligence around price points and win rates. And so, we did see it improve from that April timeframe. Historically, we've not provided that for this business segment. So, I'm not going to show that today. But know that April was where the majority of the decline occurred and we were able to step up from that position, the balance of the quarter.\nJason Seidl: Okay, that's very helpful. Also, when you look at your carrier base, have you seen any movement in terms of the smaller or micro size carriers, given the drop off and spot and the rise in fuel, have you seen those people may be hanging up the keys?\nBrad Hicks: I think that we are seeing a little bit of that, one of the areas that I think we've seen it more pronounced is the growth of our independent contractors in our JBT segment, which I do think is a relative element of people that were out operating on their own, that are looking to attach into a larger system that has better freight consistency for their benefit. And so, I think that that's certainly an element that we pay close attention to, in terms of the volume of people that are just purely hanging it up. Obviously, every day in the news, there're some carriers that we're seeing. And we would probably anticipate, given the rate levels in the spot environment that there is likelihood of more of that in the balance of the year, but not great data thus far. I do know that if we highlighted in prior years in '21 in particular, just how many people saw their operating authority. Those numbers are certainly well down from those historical highs that we saw last year. So, certainly less people are going that way. And I do feel like we've seen elements, and they've even relative to some of our driver hiring, improvement that we've experienced that could be representative of people looking for a safer place.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Jason, I might add to that. Jason, this is Shelley, I might add to that, just overall in the platform, we do see trends inside the platform. But for us, because the market is so large, we are hitting new records inside 360. That would not be unusual. And in this environment, it does allow us to move more quickly, some of what Brad just talked about, came out of the platform allowing us to make those tweaks readily. Sometimes when the flip happens suddenly, it's difficult for our platform to recognize the sudden shift or movement on price, and what price it will take to do that. So, we have to do some manual intervention there. But we have seen faster platform activity, we do have a higher retention rate as to how many carriers that are signed up or we have more carriers signed up, higher retention rates more logged in. There are several records that happen in the second quarter. So, I think from that perspective, we've seen it but from carriers just going out of business, I think that'd be difficult for us to see.\nJason Seidl: Thanks for the extra color, Shelley.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Tom, your line is now open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, great. Thank you. So, wanted to see if you could offer a quick thought on how we should think about sequential Intermodal margin, whether it might be kind of improving in 3Q versus 2Q or similar. And then, Shelley, and you added some comments at the beginning of the call or provide some commentary on freight. I'm just wondering, it seems like there's been a lot of concern about freight really falling off a lot of concern about the consumer. But it doesn't really seem like freight got that much weaker in second quarter. Do you think that it's likely that we see a significant fall-off in freight looking forward, just given the pressure on the consumer, or you think maybe it's just that the concerns about a fall-off and freight activity have been overdone a bit and maybe the consumer hangs in better than people are expecting?\nJohn Roberts: Real quick, I'll just say long-term margin target in Intermodal is 10% to 12%. And I'm sorry, Tom, that's all you get.\nShelley Simpson: So, Tom, I would say a lot of we've spent the last hour talking about is the different signals we're seeing in different parts of the market, I think part of what you've heard from Brad and how we service this is a result of a successful bid season happening and less dislocation from our shippers from the routing guide perspective. I think you're starting to see stabilization there. I will say I think we are well-positioned in any environment, whether the market turns south or stayed as is, we think that we're going to have a successful and good second-half of the year, certainly way too early for us to talk about anything beyond that, that we haven't had any customers specifically tell us that we should be concerned about volume. Certainly, we are all listening and reading the news as to what's happening out there. And if the self-fulfilling prophecy does happen then we'll adjust and make movement according to that. What's really great and I said this in our opening comment, the supply chain is inefficient, our customers are paying too much money because goods aren't moving the way they should move. We have a great opportunity to cube more for our customers, filling out trailers and containers. We also have a great opportunity to do mode conversion, getting it in a more efficient way to move goods. If 2023 sets up to be a softer freight environment, we're going to be in a perfect position because we will have added a thousand more containers -- thousands of more containers that will be onboarded and ready to start moving in January, along with the platform with Brad and our dedicated fleets, I think we're well-positioned to have a great 2023 in any environment.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. But do -- you haven't seen signs of a sharp falloff yet, right, some easing, but you just haven't seen customer input pointing to a sharp falloff at this point, is that fair?\nShelley Simpson: We have seen a more seasonal July. The last two years have been -- it's been difficult to predict what would happen in the supply chain. I would say July is typical and normal. You heard Nick earlier say that we are seeing good demand happen in the dedicated side which would be going to the store. We have had concern from customers on inventory, having the wrong inventory and where it is located. But I've not heard any customers tell us that there is a downturn coming or anything to plan from a large percentage.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now pass the conference back over to John Roberts, CEO, for any additional or closing remarks.\nJohn Roberts: Okay, thank you. And we appreciate the time you've spent with us here today. I hope we've been able to give you some color on a quarter we're proud of. And I think, importantly -- maybe even more importantly is the looking towards the second-half and into next year. The first thing I want to remind everybody on this call is that this table has a lot of experience. And we're all data-driven managers. We pay a lot of attention to what's going on around us. And all the things we've talked about here today, from bids to used truck values, any element that would inform us is being taken into consideration. And we talk very regularly about what does that change in direction in whatever element we're focused on mean to our business. And that experience that we have helps us remember what we thought the last time we might have seen something like that. So, I really feel like it's important that we remember we are 25 and 30-year senior members here; we've been through a number of these economical, whatever we're looking at here, changes. We hear really clearly from our customers, they talk to us very candidly. We talk very candidly with our rail providers. I know there's a good amount of appropriately placed concern on rail service, but I am confident, as we all are, that this will resolve itself, I'm seeing evidence of that, we're in good conversation. And I think that the overwhelming reason is that better service on the rail is a better answer for everybody involved. And so, there's not anything really in our way there. I think the comprehensive nature of our businesses, as described here today, is a great balance. We give our customers just about everything they need, and they sort of balance each other. When one is moving one direction, another one might be assisting or helping or leading to. And I think that's been covered with DCS not being a trucking company, as Nick just said, it doesn't necessarily follow the same patterns. But I fear that can still be misunderstood, even today, that that business is viewed as some kind of a trucking company. And we just really need to keep working on getting through that. But Final Mile showing us some recovery, I think the blend that's happening in highway is really productive, really puts us in a great place with our customers, as Shelley pointed out, to be mode-agnostic or indifferent, we have an answer. We blended assets into position where we can say yet to a lot of questions. And I think that, in total, these businesses are healthy, they are well-placed, they are industry-leading, run by very, very capable managers, not just at this table, but it's around our whole system, lot of experience involved there. So, it's about execution the rest of this year. As someone said, we know a lot about what we need to know about. We pay attention to our data. And I think that we are looking forward to the second-half. And we will look forward to seeing you all again on our next call. Thanks for being here.\nOperator: That concludes today's J.B. Hunt's second quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, what we collectively call highway services. While we did see a market shift in the quarter, specifically related to spot opportunities, we believe our investments in our people, technology and assets helped us deliver a great and demanded service from our customers, which I'll touch on at the end of my comments. But first let's start in ICS, ICS top line revenue growth was 3% comprised of a 3% decline in volume more than offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. Unpacking that a little more, our truckload volumes were also down about 3%. But this was largely a function of the shift I referenced earlier, our contractual truckload business increased in upper teens percent year-over-year, while our spot business was down mid-teams on a year-over-year basis. We made a call earlier this year to focus on the public side of our business, which we believe was the right strategic move. That said, we did adjust the dials mid-quarter on some of our platform parameters, and saw improvement in spot rate and freight trends as the quarter progressed, we will continue to target the right and appropriate balance between volume growth and profitability and our goal remains to outperform industry trends over the long-term on growth but more importantly, on delivering value to customers. I am confident with the power of our people and the technology investments in our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to drive increased efficiency and value in our service offering to help us deliver our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. Shifting over to truckload, we continue to see evidence of our customers valuing our drop trailer network service offering. Volume growth of 14% in the quarter supports that view, we see tremendous opportunity, as customers begin to think differently about the blending of their live network and drop trailer network capacity needs. We believe that we have the right experience managing trailing assets and a complex network business. We've gained that experience on our Intermodal business, but in this instance, leveraging all the capacity and capability of our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity for our customers versus the rail network. This shift from an asset intensive to an asset light model supports our goal of scaling a large business with fair and acceptable rates of return on our capital. In closing, I would just like to reiterate our strong belief that the blending of what has historically been separate networks, live load and unload freight versus dropped trailer, freight remains and strong demand and is valued by our customers. We remain committed to investment in our people, technology and assets to support this growth. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to Brad to give some instructions before the Operator opens the call for Q&A. Hey, Allison, this is Brad Hicks. Thank you for the question. And when I think about 360, we're very public about the investments we made in '18 and '19, really leading into '20. We do continue to invest in 360 to expand its capabilities and the value that it can create on behalf of both our customers as well as our carriers. But by and large, the -- I guess the foundation of that platform, I would say, is behind us. But that's not to say that we won't continue to make investments and find ways to improve upon it. And then, remind me again part two of your question? Yes, certainly. Thank you for the reminder. We certainly saw margins expand dramatically in the second quarter with the pressure that had been placed predominantly in the spot and where we were at relative to the bid cycle with publish rates. Is that the peak? Hard to say, and I think it's still too early to tell. Certainly, PTE has come down, but it is still well north of historical or pre-COVID levels. Obviously, Shelley mentioned there are some structural costs that probably remain. But we'll just have to see what the second-half holds around capacity versus supply. But certainly, we were able to take advantage of the expanded margins, as you can see in our results for the second quarter, we were pleased by that, and we feel like we managed through that pivot in an appropriate way. Yes, Scott, this is Brad. I would just mention maybe from a highway standpoint, I think it would be safe to anticipate that there would be flat-to-downward pressure, at least in the shorter-term. What does that mean going into all of 2023? I think it's entirely too early to really tell. I think that we'll know a lot more as we get deeper into fall in terms of understanding what demand looks like relative to supply. But, certainly, we anticipate maybe some flat-to-down pressure, and from a pure highway standpoint. Hey, Justin, this is Brad, and I'll kind of add a little bit to the fuel question, expecting that and I did some work on there. We talked about it in DCS; it was at least 100 basis point headwinds to margin percent on a year-over-year basis. We also looked at it on a sequential basis. And you would have seen a decent amount of margin improvement sequentially. If you excluded the impact of fuel, you're aware we don't report or margin than a fuel surcharge, like some others in the industry. But it was a headwind of margin. But as a general statement, I did want to say fuel is a pass through for us, and it really shouldn't impact our EBIT dollars. And so, I just want to be consistent with how we've talked about in the past and how we're talking about here. Albeit, we did provide a little bit more color on DCS recently, and I thought I'd just reiterate that. I think that we are seeing a little bit of that, one of the areas that I think we've seen it more pronounced is the growth of our independent contractors in our JBT segment, which I do think is a relative element of people that were out operating on their own, that are looking to attach into a larger system that has better freight consistency for their benefit. And so, I think that that's certainly an element that we pay close attention to, in terms of the volume of people that are just purely hanging it up. Obviously, every day in the news, there're some carriers that we're seeing. And we would probably anticipate, given the rate levels in the spot environment that there is likelihood of more of that in the balance of the year, but not great data thus far. I do know that if we highlighted in prior years in '21 in particular, just how many people saw their operating authority. Those numbers are certainly well down from those historical highs that we saw last year. So, certainly less people are going that way. And I do feel like we've seen elements, and they've even relative to some of our driver hiring, improvement that we've experienced that could be representative of people looking for a safer place."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter on a consolidated basis. And I'll also provide a quick update on our CapEx plans and our priorities for capital. Overall, we are pleased with the strong results the team was able to deliver in the quarter, highlighted with revenue growth of 32%, operating income growth of 46%, and GAAP earnings per share growth of 50%. We did incur two large but partially off-setting income statement items in the quarter. First, we incurred a $30 million increase in casualty claims, which is recorded in the insurance and claims line of our income statement. And second, we recorded an $11.6 million workers compensation insurance benefit in the salaries, wages, and benefits, line. We've discussed the net impact of $18.4 million in our release, and provided the net impact by segment in those respective sections. We were equally pleased with our efforts, and continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with leverage below our net debt target of one times EBITDA on a trailing 12-months basis. We ended the quarter with $124 million of cash, and zero drawn on our revolving credit facility.  , our $350 million 2022 notes, which are in the coming quarter, and we are reviewing our plans to retiring these notes, but are not concerned on liquidity matters given our options. On CapEx, we continue to be slightly behind our plans of $1.5 billion that we forecasted for the year. But as John alluded to you, we remain committed to that target for both replacement and growth needs to service and growth with customers. The lag in CapEx versus plan is almost entirely due to challenges in obtaining equipment. As a reminder, our priorities for our capital remain focused on building long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, and our people. We're able to accomplish this by remaining disciplined and allocating our capital to generate fair and reasonable returns to support reinvestment in our business, which remains priority number one. We bought back almost one million shares of stock in the quarter as opportunities were presented, and remain committed to buybacks and dividends as a capital management tool, as supported by our Board. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Shelley. Well, let me start on service. We talked about velocity, actually deteriorated some during the second quarter. We know that none of our rail providers are satisfied with their operations today. I think the intensity at all of our rail providers is extraordinarily high today in all efforts to onboard new crews, and find a pathway to a better service product. I think that, collectively, us and our rail providers all understand that there's additional demand, additional revenue, additional volume waiting on us to improve our service. And I think that that's universally understood. And I do anticipate that we're going to see some improvements during the second-half of the year. The key question is when. And I don't have a great answer for that. I mean, I really think the railroads will have to answer that question. But we're confident in the programs they're initiating, and we are confident that they will see improvements as the year continues. I think all we tried to highlight on the pricing front is there's accessorial programs out there for delays at customers, those certainly are areas where that's cost to remove from the customers as velocity improves. But in addition to that, equipment ownership is not cheaper today; it's more expensive than ever to buy equipment. And so, when the rail velocity improves, really our industry, I would think J.B. Hunt and all Intermodal channels will have a slight pickup in equipment costs there. And certainly we would anticipate at least some of those would be passed along to the customers. Hey, Ravi. This is John Kuhlow; I'll address the one-time charge. We tend to try to avoid calling -- referring things as one-time, but this one was a charge that we had incurred in the quarter for claims that result -- or were part of prior year. There were two or three claims that are going to settle or have settled outside of our coverage limits in one of the towers. And so, again, everything is part of the business, but these related to prior periods."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, I'll review the performance of our Dedicated and Final Mile segments, and provide an update on our professional drivers and equipment, and the impact that is having on our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remained strong as evidenced by our continued growth in our fleet during the quarter. Our backlog and pipeline also remained strong. After selling 600 trucks in Q1, we sold slightly over 800 trucks in the second quarter. We talked last quarter about seeing solid momentum in the business, and that remains the case today as we continue to onboard new business. We've added nearly 2,200 trucks to our business in the last 12 months, which continues to stand out versus the competition. This unprecedented demand and growth for our highly engineered Fleet Service has put a strain on the organization, and the team has responded extremely well to the challenge. Going forward, we will remain focused on operational excellence, attracting and retaining the best talent and executing our growth plan, which all supports the value we deliver to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile, as we discussed earlier this year, our focus for '22 has been on revenue quality and making sure our investments in our differentiated service product is properly valued in the marketplace, I'm pleased with our efforts and the success we've had so far to improve our profitability. But more work remains and remains a priority moving forward. We continue to see strong demand for our service with new customer opportunities in the pipeline. But we also have seen some softening demand in some end markets, mainly in the value furniture category. Our recent acquisition, Zenith Freight Lines is performing well and is presenting good opportunities for future growth. Zenith contributed about $28 million of revenue in the quarter. Going forward, we will remain committed to providing an unmatched service in the industry and we continue to make investments to support that effort. We believe this will support our long-term performance in this second leg growing piece of the supply chain. Closing with some general comments on operations, the driver market remains competitive and challenging, but it feels more stable than it has in a while but at considerably higher cost. That said, the equipment market remains extremely challenging and we are having to manage intensely around the impact on our operations. To support our replacement needs in the growth we've seen across our organization, we will be holding trades on roughly 4,000 tractors this year. Additionally, inflationary cost pressures on tires, parts, maintenance technicians are meaningful. And the higher frequency of repairs as a result of an ageing fleet is also impacting the utilization of our tractor equipment. We continue to work closely with our OEM providers to secure the safest and most fuel efficient equipment we can in the most expeditious way possible. That concludes my remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Darren. Yes, I was just going to say, in our dedicated business, as we watch our load count in the day, which is basically from the warehouse to the store, our volume is up and trending up. So, it's looking good from that standpoint. So, we're still seeing consumer demand strong, and that's -- we're closest to that. All right, Scott, this is Nick. To your question, I am looking at the entire book of '21 adds for us, and it's operating within 20 basis points of our base business that's been around for a long time. So, it is doing very well, that's including deals that started up in November and December. So, we're very pleased with that, and it's hitting our targets. Yes, Amit, it's Nick, I'll take the first on AB5. And we've been watching that since basically 2018 and we feel like we're in a really good spot with that. We don't expect the new law to have an immediate or material effect on our California operations. We discontinued a few years ago, our use of independent contractors operating under our authority. And so, out there, we provide either J.B. Hunt employees or we use brokerage to other motor carriers. So, we feel very confident that it's not going to interrupt our business and probably play into our strengths particularly out in the Intermodal side. I'll jump in on the dedicated side first, and thinking about that, I would just say that when I look back through our pipeline, it is still at an elevated level, a touch higher than it was this time last year. And so, I think our demand is there. And when I looked through the detail, and we reviewed it the other day, it's a lot of private fleet conversion. So, I think it's just a long-term. We got a lot of density going on right now. And a lot of density kind of helps us, we have good solutions to customers and with Intermodal growing, we have a lot of synergies there. So, I think it's just good momentum. I don't think it's cyclical. And we try to say that we're different than the normal over the road rates, one way rates. And I think this has proven it out. So, that demand is very strong, it will impact."

            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will cover current market conditions, and how we continue to have confidence in our position across our scroll of services to provide value for our customers. I'll also provide an update on our priorities across the key areas of our business which are our people, technology, and capacity, and how the combination of all three allow us to differentiate ourselves and in delivering exceptional value to our customers. The freight market remains dynamic, and continues to be presented with unique and evolving challenges at different cross-sections of the broad supply chain. Labor availability, network velocity and fluidity, in addition to varying inventory dynamics around product mix continue to put strain on the effective utilization of available capacity. Some trends we identified last quarter, like a softer transactional spot market remain, but also remains is a healthy demand for our Intermodal capacity and our professionally outsourced product fleet solution in DCS, and the frictionless way we connect customers with capacity in our highway services businesses by leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. The businesses we are in today across our entire scroll were not built or created overnight. Careful thought, planning, and execution, with durability, strength of financial discipline were, and remain top of mind. We do recognize that broader demand trends are a concern, and we continue to have frequent and open dialogue with our customers regarding their capacity needs. We remain optimistic on our ability to compete to deliver the best value to our customers by offering a full suite of services across the scroll that can help eliminate waste, create efficiencies, and drive out costs from the system. Last quarter, I said our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers is greater this year than at any point over the last two, and that remains true today. Freight has been moving inefficiently, creating additional cost, and we continue to see tremendous opportunity to eliminate waste in the system. Enhanced visibility, powered by the largest multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360, remains a tremendous opportunity for customers to effectively source their capacity needs. During the quarter, we launched new foundational principles that helps define who we are as a company, what we strive for on behalf of our customers, and what our employees should expect as a member of our organization. In fact, our innovative, entrepreneurial, and say-do culture is founded on these principles; people you trust, technology that empowers, and capacity to deliver. That is J.B. Hunt. It is by no accident that people comes first. As it is, it remains our top priority to take care of our people who take care of and deliver value for our customers. We empower our people, our organization, and our customers with investments in technology to help provide productivity and efficiencies in our collective processes. And finally, we continue to invest in our capacity to deliver on meeting the growing needs of our customers. I'll close in a similar fashion as I did last quarter, we believe our mode in different approach allows us to provide flexible solutions to dynamically meet and respond to the needs of our customers. Our investments in our people, technology and physical capacities have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in the three key areas of cost, capacity, and service. That concludes my comments. And I'd now like to turn it over to Nick. Okay, thank you, Todd. I think you gave me three questions. So, I'm going to do my best to answer them as best as possible. So -- a\u0302\u0080\u00a6 We are having really good conversation with our customers, that I think, not unlike what's happened in the pandemic the last two years, there is continuing to be challenges in the supply chain that are creating uncertainty in the market, in particular with our customers around inventory, which is really generated from consumer behavior. But just also the bottlenecks that are occurring from port activity to, we talked in our last call what was happening coming out of China. And then certainly what's happening still with labor at each part of the supply chain in general. So, I would tell you, I think we're having a seasonally normal July that might be the first July that we've seen in a seasonality perspective since COVID had started. We do think that there will be a peak. To what extent, we're still not sure. We feel confident in the different areas of our businesses and how we've having conversation with our customers. If we were to think about from a pricing perspective, we're pretty much finished with bid season, and we're going to be entering into new bid season here in a couple of months. So, our pricing is pretty much set across all of our businesses except for what's happening in the spot market in total. I think our customers are trying to understand what's happening in cost. I have talked about our transitory cost versus our structural cost challenges, and we are trying to get them up to speed, where there is transitory cost and we can start helping them create a more efficient supply chain. So, I think it's -- we haven't even started bid season and what's coming in the next couple of months, but I would say, I think our customers are prepared to have a good second-half. I haven't had a lot of feedback on a significant downturn. I will say inventory has had some short-term challenges and changes for our customers, going all the way upstream in the supply chain, but those are supposed to be more short-term than they are long-term. And, Nick, did you have something to say? Hey, Chris, it's Shelley. Just one thing to note there is we do have a unique opportunity in January where we will have more capacity on our Western Railroad providers. So, I think we're trying to equally balance the challenges of getting more Intermodal containers to move in the system, and the opportunity that will be present here in short order. So, our conversations with customers are going well around the Western network. And so, for us will be more surgical as to where we can grow. But think about our performance in the second quarter, we did a really great job, even through the challenges growing with our customers on lanes that made sense for the railroad for our customer and ourselves. And we'll continue to do that. So, I think it's going to be important that we continue to onboard equipment as we see room for growth for ourselves. Well, Jon, this is Shelley, I have a higher voice than Nick, but I would say our opportunity with our customers, we are mode indifferent. And so, understanding their needs specifically is important in how we develop what our strategy is, and how we deploy capital as a result, much like what John Kuhlow talked about in his opening remarks. For us, we think that Intermodal will continue to deliver great value for our customers, and we're bullish on our growth plan in our Intermodal segment, but we're bullish in our growth plan across all of our segments over the long-term. So, for us, we think that there are some short term pains that have felt longer-term, but we do think that there is a window of opportunity here where the rails will get better, our customers will get better, inventory will get to right locations, and the supply chain will start to find a better balance, if you will. And we think having all five of our segments that really take product from the very beginning of the supply chain all the way in to the final home of our consumer will yield ourselves well in an environment that is more normalized and for our customers will be able to say, \"Yes, anytime they need it.\" Each one of those segments has different margin targets and returns inside their own area. But we do see great growth across all five channels and Intermodal being one of our strongest growth vehicles over the next several years. Hey, Jason, I might add to that. Jason, this is Shelley, I might add to that, just overall in the platform, we do see trends inside the platform. But for us, because the market is so large, we are hitting new records inside 360. That would not be unusual. And in this environment, it does allow us to move more quickly, some of what Brad just talked about, came out of the platform allowing us to make those tweaks readily. Sometimes when the flip happens suddenly, it's difficult for our platform to recognize the sudden shift or movement on price, and what price it will take to do that. So, we have to do some manual intervention there. But we have seen faster platform activity, we do have a higher retention rate as to how many carriers that are signed up or we have more carriers signed up, higher retention rates more logged in. There are several records that happen in the second quarter. So, I think from that perspective, we've seen it but from carriers just going out of business, I think that'd be difficult for us to see. So, Tom, I would say a lot of we've spent the last hour talking about is the different signals we're seeing in different parts of the market, I think part of what you've heard from Brad and how we service this is a result of a successful bid season happening and less dislocation from our shippers from the routing guide perspective. I think you're starting to see stabilization there. I will say I think we are well-positioned in any environment, whether the market turns south or stayed as is, we think that we're going to have a successful and good second-half of the year, certainly way too early for us to talk about anything beyond that, that we haven't had any customers specifically tell us that we should be concerned about volume. Certainly, we are all listening and reading the news as to what's happening out there. And if the self-fulfilling prophecy does happen then we'll adjust and make movement according to that. What's really great and I said this in our opening comment, the supply chain is inefficient, our customers are paying too much money because goods aren't moving the way they should move. We have a great opportunity to cube more for our customers, filling out trailers and containers. We also have a great opportunity to do mode conversion, getting it in a more efficient way to move goods. If 2023 sets up to be a softer freight environment, we're going to be in a perfect position because we will have added a thousand more containers -- thousands of more containers that will be onboarded and ready to start moving in January, along with the platform with Brad and our dedicated fleets, I think we're well-positioned to have a great 2023 in any environment. We have seen a more seasonal July. The last two years have been -- it's been difficult to predict what would happen in the supply chain. I would say July is typical and normal. You heard Nick earlier say that we are seeing good demand happen in the dedicated side which would be going to the store. We have had concern from customers on inventory, having the wrong inventory and where it is located. But I've not heard any customers tell us that there is a downturn coming or anything to plan from a large percentage."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review performance of our Intermodal segment. I will also give you an update on current network dynamics, customer demand and capacity. I'll start by reviewing the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for our capacity continues to be greater than our ability to serve that demand. After seeing modest improvements in both rail velocity and customer activity in the first quarter, we saw performance deteriorate throughout the second quarter. Box turns in the quarter were essentially flat versus the first quarter and underperformed our expectations. That said, volumes by month for the quarter were up 4% in April, up 9% in May and up 10% in June on a year-over-year basis. We took delivery of an additional 1,300 containers in the quarter and expect to take delivery of more in the second-half of the year as we continue to invest in capacity to meet the needs of our customers, while our network velocity and resulting volume performance were disappointing in the quarter, the system and programs we have in place continue to protect the significant investments we've made on behalf of our customers. As we sit here today, we remain optimistic that rail performance and velocity will improve as the rails are not incentivized to move slower, near and long-term growth opportunities for Intermodal business continue to be in front of us and our rail channel partners are well aware of those opportunities. As John mentioned, we are working closely with all levels of our rail channel partners to address the velocity challenges. Starting early next year as new capacity becomes available to us on BNSF, we fully anticipate filling that available capacity, which is supported by feedback from our customers. When rail velocity does improve, we fully expect to improve available capacity but also demand for that available capacity as service levels improves. As inefficiencies are removed from the network, we fully expect that to be reflected in our cost to serve customers and rightfully so in the cost to our customers. In closing, our Intermodal product continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with significant capacity to serve their needs in a more sustainable, efficient and carbon friendly way. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our long-term growth and to better serve our customer needs. We believe our service backed by our people, and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market, and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Yes, okay, Scott, Darren here. I'll handle Intermodal first. I think, certainly, this massive change in spot prices that's evident out there feels like it is putting a little bit of pressure on Intermodal. But I don't know that I think it's this overwhelming influencer as highway capacity is still not typically the largest competitor to Intermodal out West. Typically, we're competing against all water costs or certainly other Intermodal channels or intact channels. And those costs will drive the Intermodal market, and then the underlying rail costs are doing to be the biggest influencers, far more than what is going on with truckload pricing. Now in the East, certainly highway rates can play in a real influence on our ability to convert business off the highway to Intermodal. All that being said, with fuel prices where they are, and with velocity being challenged to this point, I think we feel like preparing for the next round we should see velocity improvements which can translate to value for customers that Intermodal can provide when compared against the highway. So, I think there will be some convergence, meaning if trends in highway published prices are to trend flat or certainly slow or even take a tick down, certainly the Intermodal market will have to respond. But I think the cost, the underlying cost structure of Intermodal, really for all the channels, is a little bit different than what it is on the highway. Sure. So, well, we ended the quarter just above 110,000 containers, and we're often marching on our announced plan to expand our capacity up to 150,000 over the next three to five years. So, with only 1,300 ads in Q2 of this year, I think we would fall well short of that plan, if that is what we do. As velocity changes come about, and there's opportunities for us to gain capacity with the equipment we already own, we will adapt our pace of onboarding that equipment based on customer demand and what's going on in the market. I don't want to say that it's just going to be steady flow and will always be exactly the same. I don't think it will be but it would be certainly our opportunity to try to grow into new capacity that came from velocity improvements. But at this point, probably announcements related to our equipment will continue to just land on that march towards 150,000. And obviously, each quarter, you'll be able to see what we added, we would prefer to it to be steady, but at the same time we have to adapt and we know that ROIC will always be our Northstar and will guide us through that process. And we'll continue with the flexibility that we need to be prudent with as stewards of those investments. Yes, Amit I think I heard you say that you thought that we outsource more of our drayage activity thana\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Yes, you did it right, I'm sorry I didn't hear that right, just going to clean that up, if I didn't hear that right appreciate. So, yes, we don't feel like AB5 is going to be an influencer of our operation in any way. So, as it relates to all things joint efforts with BNSF, I think that our mission today continues to be probably more focused on elements beginning next year. I mean, frankly there's not new capacity announcements that have come from BNSF yet, as soon as something like that is available, I'm sure you'll read it, we still feel very confident in the way that we are communicating with BNSF on all things capacity. But I think that you should all anticipate and expect it right now. We're very focused on seeing velocity improvements and just service improvements in our system and that's dominating our conversations today."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter despite challenges around key factors of our business, including labor, equipment availability, and rail service. The quarter did present evidence of a cyclical shift in market balance in certain areas of our business, and we see macrodata that informs us about our current position, such as spot rates and used truck values. That said, and most importantly, our results for the quarter continue to reveal the changes we have worked to implement to enhance our position in each segment of the company based on lessons learned and experiences gained over many, many years and cycles. There are different characteristics of our business segments that should be complementary to the needs of our customers in all economic conditions. These include a flexible, much lighted asset position in our highway services offerings, compelling solutions for private fleet conversions aiding in the nuances of managing advanced transportation networks, a more economical and carbon-friendly full-load services offering in Intermodal, and a Final Mile delivery position that addresses a   growing demand channel, we remain in a leadership position across our many businesses, and from a position of strength financially and on the teams' experience and ability to navigate through an ever-changing, constantly evolving global supply chain, I am encouraged to be in healthy, cash-generating businesses across the company. Let me address the clear service challenges we are experiencing with our rail providers. We are in active discussions with the highest levels of our primary rail providers to continue our work on improving service reliability and velocity. We remain confident that the right decisions and investments will be made to bring us back to where we need to be. We remain committed to the path we are on with Intermodal, and have made no changes to our plans with the expectations for the noted improvements to show through in the second-half of this year. In fact, at this point, we have made no alterations to our plans for the year in our equipment and capital expenditure allocations. While we acknowledge there are timing and delivery challenges, we take a long view and know that we have extended needs in all categories for replacement and growth assets. This position recognizes so-called crosswinds we are experiencing, as noted, and will be covered more during this call. Our direction is fully informed using real-time data on all key aspects of each business and input from our customers. Our leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow, for his thoughts on the quarter. John? Yes, so the demand is still strong. It's spotty. And some, as we said, in our press release in the value, furniture side of things, the demand is there, one of the CEOs of one of those companies told me that a year-ago, fish were jumping in, customers were jumping into his boat, six months ago, he had to fish with, I hope with nobody on it. And now he's having to work really hard to get sales. So, that was the analogy there. So, that's for the lower end furniture value side, the other side is really still busy. Inventories are getting corrected. So, we're seeing a lot of demand, we picked up some new business there. And our service is really what's separating us and our background checks. And that seems to be playing well. And you're seeing this quarter, a lot of would put a lot of pressure on rate at existing business. And we were successful in that, we lost some, but we feel good about the locations we lost. So, it's setting up good. And we got some more room to go. Yes, I think we're going to see, we're not going to give guidance, but we're happy with where we're at right now. Yes, Jason, I think what I wanted to help understand is that we saw a really sharp decline in spot activity throughout the month of April. And finishing up March, as we talked about, our volumes were pretty positive in Q1, but really kind of hit a wall, those first 15 to 18 days of April, then we were at that's when we were able to change some of our parameters and the algorithms that we use and some of our artificial intelligence around price points and win rates. And so, we did see it improve from that April timeframe. Historically, we've not provided that for this business segment. So, I'm not going to show that today. But know that April was where the majority of the decline occurred and we were able to step up from that position, the balance of the quarter. Real quick, I'll just say long-term margin target in Intermodal is 10% to 12%. And I'm sorry, Tom, that's all you get. Okay, thank you. And we appreciate the time you've spent with us here today. I hope we've been able to give you some color on a quarter we're proud of. And I think, importantly -- maybe even more importantly is the looking towards the second-half and into next year. The first thing I want to remind everybody on this call is that this table has a lot of experience. And we're all data-driven managers. We pay a lot of attention to what's going on around us. And all the things we've talked about here today, from bids to used truck values, any element that would inform us is being taken into consideration. And we talk very regularly about what does that change in direction in whatever element we're focused on mean to our business. And that experience that we have helps us remember what we thought the last time we might have seen something like that. So, I really feel like it's important that we remember we are 25 and 30-year senior members here; we've been through a number of these economical, whatever we're looking at here, changes. We hear really clearly from our customers, they talk to us very candidly. We talk very candidly with our rail providers. I know there's a good amount of appropriately placed concern on rail service, but I am confident, as we all are, that this will resolve itself, I'm seeing evidence of that, we're in good conversation. And I think that the overwhelming reason is that better service on the rail is a better answer for everybody involved. And so, there's not anything really in our way there. I think the comprehensive nature of our businesses, as described here today, is a great balance. We give our customers just about everything they need, and they sort of balance each other. When one is moving one direction, another one might be assisting or helping or leading to. And I think that's been covered with DCS not being a trucking company, as Nick just said, it doesn't necessarily follow the same patterns. But I fear that can still be misunderstood, even today, that that business is viewed as some kind of a trucking company. And we just really need to keep working on getting through that. But Final Mile showing us some recovery, I think the blend that's happening in highway is really productive, really puts us in a great place with our customers, as Shelley pointed out, to be mode-agnostic or indifferent, we have an answer. We blended assets into position where we can say yet to a lot of questions. And I think that, in total, these businesses are healthy, they are well-placed, they are industry-leading, run by very, very capable managers, not just at this table, but it's around our whole system, lot of experience involved there. So, it's about execution the rest of this year. As someone said, we know a lot about what we need to know about. We pay attention to our data. And I think that we are looking forward to the second-half. And we will look forward to seeing you all again on our next call. Thanks for being here."

This afternoon, I am joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Shelley Simpson, our Chief Commercial Officer and EVP of People and Human Resources; Nick Hobbs, Chief Operating Officer and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We see the start of 2022 and this first quarter\u2019s report is both encouraging and revealing. While overall labor and other supply chain issues have continued, we leveraged experience, focus and technology to move through this period with success. Execution across all disciplines within the organization is running at solid performance levels, yet we have clear opportunities for improvement. Our equipment utilization continues to underperform due to consistent challenges with philosophy and the persistent need for new driver hires. We added 1,889 net drivers during 2021 and have so far increased our driver force by just over 1,400 this year. Our hiring teams are built out to levels not seen before in our history. The increased ability to improve hiring performance are enabled by the increases in driver compensation, improved benefits, reliable schedules with predictable home time and a company environment centered on growth for future career expansion. For the past 18 months, our entire people and human resources discipline has been in a comprehensive refresh, presenting the opportunity to make meaningful changes in the quality of services these capable teams can bring to the most critical area of our business, all of our people, current and new. As noted, we announced a multiyear expansion plan for our intermodal fleet recently, coinciding with the renewed commitment between BNSF and JBHT. The opportunities that lie ahead in serving our customers are rejuvenated by this commitment and we anticipate leveraging this unique and industry-leading position. The transportation dynamics of driver shortages and increasing labor costs, high fuel prices, congestion, reliable capacity, not to mention the remarkable impacts that intermodal has in the Scope 3 emission reductions for our shippers gives us confidence in our decisions here. Another important recent development is the formation of our Inclusion Council consisting of a highly cross-functional group of managers and executives whose purpose is to continue to guide the organization towards new awareness and actions. This will no doubt make us a better company. Our leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts on the quarter. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter, providing some additional perspective to the results on a consolidated level. I will provide a quick update on capital expenditure plans for the year and then I will spend a little bit more time talking about our priorities around our capital allocation in light of recent market events and opportunities we see to capitalize on long-term sustainable growth in our business. Overall, we are pleased with our performance for the first quarter of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 33% and operating income growth of 61% versus the prior year period. These results were tempered by some fairly meaningful labor challenges at the start of the quarter related to Omicron variant outbreak. The most notable impact from this challenge was in our DCS business as driver availability and productivity were impacted. We also saw challenges in our rail velocity and intermodal and in product availability in our FMS network. That said, the market tightness presented our highway businesses opportunities to step in to meet customer needs and our technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, provided us an efficient and effective avenue to source capacity for and on behalf of our customers. This continues to prove out the resiliency of our multimodal business model and our broader mode agnostic supply chain solutions offering. We have discontinued providing COVID-related costs on a quarterly basis a few quarters ago as the numbers were not meaningful to our consolidated results, but we did incur a little over $7 million in direct COVID-related costs for paid time off for those needing the quarantine and also for those needing time to get vaccinated in the quarter. Weather also presented some challenges to our network businesses, but no more or less than what we had expected given our line of work. I would say, similar to my comments last quarter, labor continues to be an area with the greatest inflationary pressure in both professional driver and non-driver salary wages and benefits and we expect that trend to continue throughout the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $18 million of gains on sale of equipment in the quarter, which are atypical for us. We had very few trades last year as we hold most of our equipment to support our organic growth. Below the line, our tax rate was 24.4%, slightly lower, while our interest expense was modestly higher year-over-year, netting us to GAAP EPS of $2.29 or a 67% increase year-over-year. Continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet with $145 million of cash, zero drawn on our revolver and up to $750 million capacity on the revolver and our net debt balance remains below our targeted level of 1x trailing EBITDA at 0.6. Last quarter, I provided CapEx plans of $1.5 billion for the year. And while we are slightly behind plan through the first quarter due to continued constraints and equipment availability, $1.5 billion remains our target for 2022. A quick update on our capital allocation priorities is that it hasn\u2019t changed. We will continue to prioritize supporting the growth of our business with reinvestment as needed, remaining committed to our investments in capacity to help serve our growing customer base. We recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 a share or 33% from prior levels and keeping with our dividend strategy. We also intend to incorporate mindful share repurchases and opportunistically execute on M&A opportunities. We remain conservatively leveraged to maintain our investment-grade rating. However, we are not afraid to increase leverage as opportunities arise. I\u2019d like to reemphasize that investments in our business will continue to be supported by sound financial discipline and maintaining fair and reasonable returns on our invested capital. This keeps our business strong, healthy and capable of growing to meet the growing needs of our customers. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions and how we are serving our customers\u2019 needs by leveraging our investments in our people, our physical assets and our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. I\u2019ll provide an update on this season, which will provide some insight into our expectations for the year. And finally, I will provide some priorities that our organization will be focused on achieving this year for our people and for and on behalf of our customers. As has been the case much of the last 2 years, the market remains extremely dynamic as also evidenced by our experience in the first quarter with disruptions across the supply chain related to the Omicron variant, weather events across the network, labor availability and rapidly rising fuel and commodity cost. We believe our mode-agnostic approach with our assets and technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, both of which are powered and enabled by our people, allow us to dynamically meet and respond to the needs of our customers. As the quarter progressed, the market finally began to find more balance, which was evidenced by the expansion in margin we saw in our Highway Services segments. As we have discussed for some time, freight has been moving inefficiently over the last 2 years creating additional costs for our customers and additional costs for our business. 5 years ago, we launched internally our cycle of innovation to disrupt, adapt and to accelerate, which happened to coincide with the launch of J.B. Hunt 360. As we hit the 5-year anniversary for J.B. Hunt 360, I\u2019d like to reflect on our journey and our investments. The investments we have made are intended to disrupt our industry. We, as an organization, had to adapt and make sure we had the right organizational structure and processes in place to execute our strategy. A month before the pandemic began, our organization transitioned to the theme, accelerate. Going forward, we will continue with our current theme to accelerate. We will accelerate the speed at which we serve our customers, accelerate our investments in areas with promising long-term growth potential, and accelerate our ability to react to the needs of our customers. Under this theme of acceleration, we will remain focused on opportunities to add value to our customers as our people, technology and assets come together to provide highly engineered cost-saving solutions. We believe this remains the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth and we will continue to approach the market that way while maintaining our financial discipline on fair and appropriate returns on our capital. We are now almost halfway through bid season and we are extremely encouraged by the feedback and the confidence that our customers have in us to deliver an efficient and cost effective solution for their shipping needs. As we sit here today, demand for our services and in particular, the asset side of our business is the strongest I have seen in my 27-year career at the company and this demand continues to put pressure on our need for more equipment and people. Going forward, we have a lot of confidence in our plan to grow our capacity. And we believe it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, some of the labor challenges, which includes our rail providers, will moderate and ultimately assist us with improved fluidity. With elevated energy prices, customers are needing and expecting a lot from us, but capacity in an intermodal network remains extremely tight. Thankfully, our scroller services allow us to continue to offer capacity solutions and say yes to our customers with our ability to source that capacity in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. Finally, I want to take some time to provide you some of our priorities for the year. As I discussed last quarter, we believe that market dynamics will present us with a lot of opportunities to grow and that remains the case today as well as a priority. But I also believe our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers, is greater this year than at any point in the last 2 years. Our investments in our container fleet, trailing fleet, technology and people have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in three key areas: cost, capacity and service, more than any point since the beginning of this pandemic. I strongly believe in our team\u2019s ability to execute for and on behalf of our customers, delivering value and efficient solutions and this will remain our priority as well as it has always. This strategy, combined with our financial discipline, gives us even greater confidence as we have set out to achieve our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments. I\u2019d now like to turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thank you, Shelley and good afternoon. Today, I am going to review the performance of both our Dedicated and Final Mile segments as well as give some updated thoughts on current trends in some of our high level expectations as we move throughout the year. I will also provide some perspective on the current challenges we face and the industry are facing in sourcing both equipment and professional drivers. I will start my comments on Dedicated. At the expense of sounding like a broken record, our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business and startups continues to build to record levels. After coming off a record year of selling roughly 2,500 trucks in 2021, the first quarter kept pace with around 600 trucks sold in what is normally a slower time of the year for new business sales. As it pertains to the results in the quarter, revenue grew 28%, driven primarily by the average fleet size that was about 2,000 trucks or 20% larger than a year ago, which I believe is the true standout for our organization and in the industry. Margins in the quarter remained under pressure despite improving sequentially as a result of startup cost as we onboarded almost half the accounts in the first quarter than what we did all of last year. I will also share that our operations and productivity were negatively impacted by labor challenges brought on by Omicron variant in January and weather events in February. That only added to some of the startup expenses we incurred. That said and hopefully, with COVID and weather events largely behind us, we saw performance and momentum out of the segment in March, which we believe should carry forward. Our new accounts onboarded last year are performing as expected, which gives us confidence in our approach to the market and our annual price escalators will continue to protect us against broader inflationary pressures. Our concerns remain on both equipment and labor availability, namely professional drivers as our needs for both remain extremely elevated and may ultimately govern our pace of growth if demand remains or accelerates from current levels. In terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan as well as maintaining our culture of operational excellence, high service and safety, which supports the value we deliver to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile, revenue grew about 8% versus previous year period, driven by newly awarded accounts over the last year, but offset by some of the supply chain challenges impacting some of the primary markets we serve in this segment, namely appliances and furniture. We also announced and closed on the acquisition of Zenith Freight Lines in the quarter, which contributed about $10 million in revenue for the one month it was consolidated in our results. We continue to make investments in our service quality and performance in order to differentiate ourselves in the market. We believe these investments are wise over the long-term as safety and service will be the cornerstone to our long-term growth and success. As we discussed last quarter, we are coming off a strong year of new business sales, giving us confidence in our differentiated service product. This confidence supported our decision to put some of our underperforming business at risk which we have done over the last few months. While it\u2019s too early to come to conclusions on all the underperforming accounts, we have been successful at getting meaningful rate increases at several accounts that should support better earnings and margin performance ahead. We remain focused on generating appropriate financial returns on our business so we can reinvest to provide more capacity and services for our customers. Going forward, our priorities remain investing in the business to support its growth, but with some greater emphasis on improving the profitability in this segment in 2022. Closing out with some operational updates. As I alluded to in my dedicated comments, the equipment market and professional driver market remain extremely tight. We have clearly had success growing our equipment levels and professional driver workforce to meet the most of the needs of our intermodal and dedicated businesses. But let me be clear, it hasn\u2019t been easy and it certainly hasn\u2019t been cheap. We have relied heavily on some of our key OEMs to help support our growth, but I am afraid it\u2019s not enough and we are exploring new suppliers across all of our areas of need to support our growth. That concludes my remarks. So I will turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick and hello to everyone on the call. My comments this afternoon will recap the performance of our intermodal business in the quarter. I will also want to give some comments on our recent joint announcement with the BNSF to improve intermodal capacity challenges and what our priorities are for the business as we continue to invest in our people and capacity for meeting the strong and growing demand for intermodal services in the months, quarters and years ahead. I will start with the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for the intermodal capacity remained extremely strong throughout the first quarter and importantly, it remains so today. As has been the case for some time, our ability to execute on all of the demand for our intermodal capacity was hampered by rail velocity and to a lesser extent, the retention of our equipment from customers. Box turns did deteriorate sequentially from fourth quarter, which is in line with seasonality, but nonetheless, still disappointing at current levels. The Omicron variant did impact labor availability for our rail providers and our customers and in our operations as well. And thankfully, those trends did improve as the quarter progressed, particularly for our customers as well as in our operations. Volumes for the month for the quarter were down 1% in January, plus 17% in February and plus 6% in March. Keep in mind, February was a fairly easy comp due to some weather events in 2021. We were successful at onboarding over 4,300 containers in the quarter and I am proud of our team for their execution on that front, which puts us in better position to meet the growing needs of our customers. We plan on taking delivery of the remaining balance of the 6,000 containers from our 2021 order during the second quarter. We did see approximately $14 million in gains on sale of equipment, which is unusual for us, but nonetheless should be transparently disclosed. Importantly, the core of our business is performing well in light of the inflationary and fluidity challenges facing the business and network, which is supported by our people running the operations and our customers who value our service offering. During the last quarter, J.B. Hunt and BNSF announced a joint initiative to substantially improve capacity in the intermodal marketplace while meeting the expanding needs of our current customers. This is an important moment for our organization as the largest railroad and domestic intermodal carrier will be collaborating even more closely together to provide an unparalleled intermodal product, leveraging the talents, skills and technologies of both companies to provide a seamless door-to-door solutions for our customers. With some channel partners leaving the BNSF network, we were provided an opportunity and have developed a plan to grow our intermodal container count to 150,000 in the next 3 to 5 years. This represents 40% growth from our count at the end of 2021. For the record, let me state the easiest thing we can do is go out and buy more containers. This will be a significant endeavor for our organization and will require investment in people, equipment and technology to get our desired outcomes. Importantly, these investments will be done with the same financial discipline as in the past. Needless to say, I\u2019m excited and energized for our organization as we grow to meet the needs of our customers. As we look forward, I thought I would share a little bit of perspective about our priorities for Intermodal this year. As Shelley discussed, we are encouraged by the level of demand we are seeing throughout the bid process for our capacity, which continues to give us confidence to make investments. We strongly believe in the value proposition we can deliver on the three key items our customers care about, which is cost capacity and service. As it stands today, there are inefficiencies across the supply chain and within the rail network that is impacting velocity. We are cautiously optimistic that velocity will improve which will create more capacity for our customers while improving efficiencies and costs in our operations. Simply put, this is a good outcome for our rail providers, our customers and for J.B. Hunt. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our growth to help us meet the robust demand we are seeing for intermodal capacity. In closing, Intermodal\u2019s value proposition remains strong, supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight as well as transloading cargo into our domestic containers. We believe our service backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to cover the performance of our Highway Service businesses, which includes both integrated capacity solutions and trucks. We continue to see tremendous opportunity to leverage our investments in our people, assets and technology to support the growth opportunities presented to us by our customers. As evidenced by our results, I think we were able to demonstrate that in the first quarter. So with that, let me go ahead and dive into the performance of the segments that make up highway and provide some perspective on our priorities moving forward as well as some perspective on the market currently. I\u2019d like to start with truck at JBT. Revenue grew 77% year-over-year to $264 million, while operating income improved to $31.5 million in the quarter. This represents some of the strongest quarterly performances in the segment going back to 2005, yet with less than 20% of the company trucks or assets than we had running in the segment at that time. This continues to support our decision to invest in trailing assets for this segment while leveraging our investments in our technology, specifically J.B. Hunt 360, to source the most efficient capacity to move freight for and on behalf of our customers. As Shelley mentioned in her comments, demand for our trailing assets, which is our 360box product, remains strong as customers continue to realize the efficiencies and benefits of giving us a holistic view of their freight and allow us to blend their live and drop trailer networks with a single-source solution. We continue to see strong customer demand for this product and service offering as they recognize these benefits. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our people, growing our trailing fleet and leveraging our technology to support long-term sustainable growth in the segment while maintaining our financial discipline around acceptable returns on invested capital. To close out on JBT, you might have noticed an update to some of the stats we shared on this segment, which we believe better aligns with how the business has transformed with the introduction of our 360box service offering by managing a trailing capacity fleet and sourcing the most efficient capacity to move it for our customers, whether it\u2019s our truck or asset or someone else\u2019s. Shifting gears now to ICS. We delivered $675 million of revenue in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 29% versus the prior year period. This growth was driven by more balance between volumes and revenue per load than in our more recent periods as our segments volume grew 12% year-over-year. Specific to truckload volumes, our growth was 15% versus the prior year period. We have seen a moderation in spot opportunities as of late, which we attribute partly to more customer shifting freight out of the spot market into published or contractual business but also recognizing a movement in the market towards more balance. Taking that a step further for the quarter, our published business was up more than 20% while our spot business was up low single digits. That said, we continue to see record levels of freight opportunities from our customers to execute in our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, which we think demonstrates the power of our platform to source the most efficient means of moving freight for and on behalf of our customers. Going forward, we will continue to focus on leveraging our people and our technology to provide an efficient solution for our customers. We believe this will support our long-term growth and will be supported by fair and adequate returns on invested capital. In closing, I\u2019d like to leave you with our confidence to continue to invest in the areas I\u2019ve highlighted for you, and that is our trailing capacity, our people and our technology. We continue to see how each complements one another to provide the most efficient solution for our customers. Our customers have and always will remain focused on cost, capacity and service. And if we can differentiate ourselves and deliver on all three, we believe that is the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth. As we continue to deliver on our value proposition for customers, we stay true to our mission, to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments, so I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nOperator:  The first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just start with the sort of most, I guess, pressing question that we\u2019re getting asked in the market is sort of your view on the freight cycle and if you\u2019re seeing some incremental weakness, maybe thoughts on the potential for consumer-led freight recession over the course of maybe the next several quarters. And then specifically within that, how should we think about intermodal volumes performing, say, there is some downturn in overall consumer freight? It would seem \u2013 I think you guys noted that there is demand above what you\u2019re able to sort of fill in the market today is kind of curious how you think that would play out if we were to see a slowdown in broader freight. Maybe that\u2019s a question for John or Shelley.\nShelley Simpson: Okay. Thank you, Chris. So I will say that there are varying signals in the market. And a lot of what you\u2019re hearing in the market is in the spot market, so small carrier capacity for the most part, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s causing a lot of conversation. If you look across all of our five segments, you would see differing viewpoints inside the segments overall. I do think there has been a temporary relief in the dislocation from labor shortages and also just where shipments are located. We do forecast that to get a lot worse as we come into the summer months, particularly with what\u2019s happening in the supply chain from an ocean perspective or in China coming inbound. So we have had a lot of customers talk to us about that. Also, I did mention that our bid season is the best bid season that I have seen and very pleased with our customers leaning into us for solutions. I will say, if there is something that were to occur, and we see a lot of inefficiency in the market, we are constantly talking to our customers about what that is. That\u2019s why you hear us and have heard us talk about creating most efficient transportation network in North America because we see a lack of efficiency. Part of that\u2019s labor-driven, but another part of that is most of our customers have been primarily concerned with on-shelf availability, not as much around efficiency. So we see opportunity to help our customers increase payload and get freight into its most optimal mode. We happen to have the most optimal land transportation mode in intermodal. And so whether it\u2019s a downturn or even in the current environment, we do think there is a lot of freight from what we see in this season that can move into a more efficient mode like intermodal. But I would say across the segments, I think that there are cost and structural issues that will continue to remain. I think it\u2019s too early to say if there is anything happening with the consumer over the long-term. But certainly, we\u2019re watching all of those signals. I would tell you, customers are leaning into us more now even including the most recent data. So I think that would say there are more supply chain disruptions happening that could be lending to what we are seeing in the market today.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. I will leave it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wetherbee. The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may proceed.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good afternoon. Shelley, can you just clarify those comments about the shutdowns in China and what you think that means for volumes now and then heading into the summer? And then Darren, just with spot prices down, but fuel up a lot, how are you thinking \u2013 how do you see the spread right now between trucking and intermodal rates?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, Scott, so I\u2019ll take that first part. If you actually look at the live screen shot of what\u2019s happening in Shanghai, the ships are \u2013 it looks just like a lot of ships and a little bit of water. And so that certainly is going to make its way back into the U.S. here this summer. Our customers are concerned about the July time frame between that and also what\u2019s happening with labor at the port. I think there could be reason for concern or just reason to have different conversations. In this type of an environment just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching out for.\nDarren Field: So somehow, Scott, snuck two questions in there, but I\u2019ll try to respond here. Spot prices in the truckload market have always been volatile over time. And we\u2019ve seen times in the past when they rocketed up, times of really expensive or higher cost of fuel. And in this most recent 2-year window, I mean, spot prices for highway solutions have risen because in some cases, intermodal capacity was tapped out. And so all of a sudden, there is a much larger truckload spot market originating from the West Coast, for example. Those \u2013 the gap between that kind of rate and an intermodal price is north of 2x. I mean you\u2019re 200% higher to buy a spot-rated truckload solution off the West Coast versus an intermodal rate. So there is a very significant gap before truckload prices put any kind of pressure back on the intermodal market. So again, intermodal demand is extraordinarily high. We have more demand from customers than we currently have capacity to serve. And so I\u2019m very encouraged by that demand cycle feel strongly that intermodal can continue to grow. And I don\u2019t really feel like, at this time, truckload rates falling is putting any pressure on intermodal pricing.\nScott Group: Thank you. I will get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Group. The next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, I\u2019m going to stick with you. That 7% volume growth number in 1Q, I understand that February was a very easy comp, but the rails all had easy comps, too, and no one put up even growth, let alone almost high single digits from a volume perspective. How much of this was just strictly the new equipment that you brought on? How much of it is Hunt-specific market share gains? And when you think about this long-term growth strategy you\u2019ve set up, and we layer that on top of this really strong relative 1Q, how sustainable is this type of outperformance as you continue to invest in the business?\nDarren Field: Okay. Well, I appreciate that. We\u2019re proud of our results but not yet satisfied because we can actually grow more than that and demand is actually stronger for our product, and that gives us a lot of motivation, a lot of energy. So certainly, the new equipment we added last year and onboarded during the first quarter obviously contributed significantly to our growth. When I say we can grow more, I mean, 6 months ago, prior to the \u2013 midway through last year or even in the third quarter of last year, we would have anticipated stronger growth than we achieved, but that equipment we added really was consumed by weakness in velocity. And I don\u2019t want to beat a velocity drum here on the call all day today. Our rail providers all know that it needs to get better. They are all working very hard to improve that. We\u2019re very aware that they can improve that, fully anticipate that they will. The question remains when does that begin to show up. And certainly, during the first quarter, there were some challenges in that area. We\u2019re turning down thousands of loads per week and feel strongly that we have more volume to grow as velocity picks up. And again, we\u2019re very encouraged by the way we\u2019re communicating with both our customers as well as our rail providers.\nJon Chappell: Got it. Thank you, Darren.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Chappell. The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. You may proceed.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. Bigger picture, two of the priorities that you\u2019ve conveyed historically are a focus on growth and a focus on ROIC. I wanted to ask about the balance between those two items, specifically as it relates to intermodal. As we think about your intermodal container fleet growing 40% plus in the next 3 to 5 years, do you feel like that\u2019s something you can execute in a way that\u2019s accretive to intermodal ROIC? And if the answer to that is yes, I\u2019m curious what the assumptions are from a pricing and box turn perspective to make that math work.\nDarren Field: My goodness, Justin, you just asked for all of the answers there. So certainly, we\u2019ve highlighted that returns drive our investment decisions. And that\u2019s not any different today with the announcement of the expansion of our equipment. I think that, that signals our belief in the long-term growth available in the intermodal system and that, that growth can come on board at the return profiles that we would expect. Now there comes a point at which whether or not it\u2019s accretive or you simply are just sustaining your return profile. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 there will be some small cycles whenever \u2013 if we get the opportunity to take cost out of our system, I could see a world where that transfers to prices that go back to the customers. And that\u2019s okay. We fully anticipate a velocity improvement \u2013 and that could very well result in prices going back a little bit to benefit the customers because, frankly, today, weakness in velocity has been considered inside the intermodal system. But I would certainly believe that we can sustain long-standing success with our ROIC. And we don\u2019t \u2013 and we\u2019re not willing to grow in a world that would damage that. That\u2019s the first thing that would slow down that investment. So that\u2019s a \u2013 that is core tenet number one at J.B. Hunt, and there will be no change to that.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great, I will leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Long. The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nKen Hoexter: Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-ups on that. The agreement with Burlington, Darren, can you talk about or be any more specific on the time frame to get that target? Or what encourages you to speed that up to the 3 versus the 5 years in terms of growth? And in the agreement, anything that you can specify in terms of \u2013 it sounded like you were aiming to improve service. Are there things you want to work on through that in the long-term part of that agreement? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Okay. I appreciate the question. I am not going to call out anything specific in the agreement. I think it\u2019s really \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s of note that we made that release jointly. And BNSF\u2019s logo is on the same press release with ours, and that\u2019s because we are very aligned in our efforts around growth. We are aligned in our efforts around how we can use technology and build out our systems in a better way that allows both of us collectively to be more efficient on the hold. That could mean things like if we get an opportunity to take a load in the gate at a BNSF location and park it track side so we can eliminate a hostile move. We want to connect our technology so that the planners with BNSF have good visibility into loads that haven\u2019t yet picked up, but that are going to come in the gate later that day. And that\u2019s why you heard in some of the prepared comments that the easiest thing we can do is go buy containers. And that\u2019s very true. I mean, the mission we are on has a lot more to do with how we work together, how we work with our customers and how we solve long-term supply chain solutions together. And all of that effort drives into that decision on growing the capacity, whether it\u2019s in 3 years or 5 years. I mean certainly, the window is in there because we recognize that there has been a velocity loss in the system. And over these next couple of years, we anticipate a time when we can get velocity back. We would fully expect to do that. And if that gives us the opportunity to grow and maybe we didn\u2019t have to onboard quite as many containers in a given period, that\u2019s okay, too. I mean we are \u2013 we also highlighted that our ROIC is going to be the driving landmark behind how we do that. We are so confident in the market size and the magnitude of the opportunity, that\u2019s why we made that announcement, and we are more aligned than ever with BNSF and we are very energized by these \u2013 that announcement.\nKen Hoexter: Great. I appreciate that.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Just sort of curious in light of your comments around congestion and what may be coming if this lull from China starts coming over here. On box turns, where you noted it was a little disappointing in the grand scheme of things in the first quarter, although in line with seasonality, how are you thinking about it from here, whether it be sequentially normal seasonality? Can you see some year-over-year improvement, or is it hard to call at this point? Thanks.\nDarren Field: I mean I think that it\u2019s a little bit hard to call. I mean again, we \u2013 our commentary on box turns had a lot more to do with velocity challenges, not from anything going on in China. Certainly, demand is very strong. And so we are encouraged by that and would anticipate that box turns will improve as velocity improves.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks everyone. So, just on the new agreement with BN, is it possible to quantify kind of how much of that 40% growth is likely to come from just expanding the pie and kind of truck conversion, etcetera, versus taking market share? Because kind of obviously, with your peers also growing capacity by a similar amount, that is a lot of capacity coming in. So, are you guys like pretty confident you can convert all that on truck, or is that going to be kind of a share shift from your peers?\nDarren Field: So first of all, there is not a new agreement with BNSF, I want to be clear about that. We have had a long, long-term agreement with BNSF, and we are energized by the work we are doing together as we have been energized by that for 30-plus years now. The growth is going to come organically from our customers. The growth is going to come from significant inefficiency in the networks today where truckload business is moving intermodal that should be intermodal. And lastly, there continues to be a really significant effort amongst some of our customers to grow their transload business and take international intact off of the railroad and replace that with domestic intermodal, and that certainly can present some additional efficiency for our customers. So, we always look to grow in that way. We don\u2019t look to grow by just going out in a pricing site with the host of intermodal channels. We believe strongly in presenting supply chain solutions to our customers. And that\u2019s going to drive a behavior change or a mode change in the way they are executing it. There will certainly always be business that\u2019s in the bid that other people handle. But our mission to grow is off the highway and transload and organic growth with our existing customers.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi everybody. Darren, can you just talk about where box turns exited in 1Q? I understand January obviously bringing on the quarter down, but I want to understand where you exited. And when can we see more meaningful improvement? Because I understand velocity and train solidity is obviously key variables, but all else equal, I would imagine that this new initiative helps turn the boxes faster. So, if you could just talk about where you exited in the first quarter and when can we see more meaningful kind of idiosyncratic improvement on the back of this initiative. And I also think talking about the long-term margin target, which you guys obviously reduced. It\u2019s \u2013 I guess it\u2019s my understanding that maybe you guys incurred some extra costs associated with the cyclicality of the BN relationship, if I could put it that way. And now obviously, with that relationship, both parties kind of rowing in the same direction for the first time in a while, in this initiative, is there an opportunity to revisit that margin target, or would you use that as kind of a lever for growth? If you can just address those points, please.\nDarren Field: Well, I will just quickly start with your second question and say it took us the better part of 3 years or 4 years to change our margin target. We don\u2019t have an update for you today. Certainly, it\u2019s our mission to be focused on our return on invested capital. And that\u2019s what we are focused on and the margin turns out to be kind of an output from that. I don\u2019t have a good way to describe the turn number coming out of the quarter. What I would just say is we highlighted that volumes were still slightly negative in January, and then we started to experience growth as the quarter went on. We did onboard new equipment as the quarter went on, and we are not satisfied with our turn number, but we are encouraged by what we have seen from our customers, and we are beginning to have \u2013 we are encouraged by what we are seeing from the rail network today. But it\u2019s nowhere near getting back to where it was prior to the pandemic. So, we have a long ways to go in that area. But there is no lack of motivation from our rail providers to improve their velocity. So, as that goes, we are going to continue to work on box turns. That will be a subject forever. But until we can get an improvement in box turns, we have to consider the cost of the ownership of that equipment at the weaker velocity until we can get an improvement. And at that point, I am certain you will see those results in our results.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I just want to turn to dedicated. There is \u2013 obviously, the pipeline is quite strong and dedicated. You referenced that, but there was also a comment around the ability to get capacity there, potentially limiting your growth. Is there any way to better understand how that limiting capacity is limiting your growth? Is there weighted \u2013 is it a point or two points? And do you think you can overcome that based on your current conversations with the OEMs? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Yes. The big challenge and what it limits really is we are having to use hold trucks for up to six months and to help us increase our capacity just because of the chip shortages and other components that the OEMs are facing right now. So, we are addressing that. Right now, it\u2019s not limiting us other than it\u2019s pushing what would normally be a 90-day start-up up to 120 days. So, that\u2019s pushing out some start-ups a little bit longer. But at this point, it\u2019s not really limiting us for many deals. Our pipeline is still very strong. It\u2019s just pushing them out probably another 30 days from what we would normally have out there. We are having good conversations with OEMs, but none of them have any extra capacity at this point.\nAllison Poliniak: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Shelley, maybe just a follow-up on the earlier question around consumer demand just because there is so much conjecture and anecdotes in the market right now about a looming freight recession. I think you said the market is sending you mixed signals, but are you seeing a slowdown in demand in any of your customer segments? And then maybe second to that, as we see spot truck rates come down and everyone is focused on that, how is that going to impact the ICS, because I think it actually gained pretty good volume gains there, at least through the first quarter. Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: Okay. So, I think we noted that we are seeing strength, particularly in the asset part of our businesses. Part of that is because intermodal is the most efficient way to move business and dedicated really taking on a private fleet in a long-term agreement. But also in JBT and 360box, we are seeing significant growth, and our customers are really pushing us in that space. Part of that is labor challenge, but I think part of it is we are solving for a better way to do business more efficiently by utilizing the box. All of that\u2019s powered through J.B. Hunt 360. So, I think that\u2019s one of the biggest benefits we have seen through our technology is the growth that we have seen and also the value we create for our customers. In ICS, as margins were \u2013 or excuse me, if there were some kind of downturn, I think margins would change clearly from a margin expansion as most of our bids have been \u2013 are either locked in or about halfway through or so we will have pricing locked in for a large portion of that business. And then we are going to be flexible in the market from a spot perspective. That really goes across all of our businesses. Anywhere we have a chance to talk to our customers about being dynamic in pricing and capacity, we are going to do that on behalf of our customers. So, that will move with the market and then our contract pricing will stay relatively in line with whatever we finish in bid season.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. And just the last six weeks, you have had diesel prices go up $1. You have had the SEC seek to require disclosures of Scope 3 and supply chain emissions. And you have announced this investment publicly that you intend to make in your capacity in partnership with BN to deliver on that for your customers. Can you talk a little bit \u2013 is the customer buying behavior in intermodal changing? Do you have customers out there asking for capacity in \u201823, \u201824, \u201825? Is there a chance this could shift to a take-or-pay type commitment? Just how much visibility do you have? And where are your strategic customers looking to grow with you, not just this year but the year after and the year after? Thanks.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you for that. I really should have mentioned it\u2019s not just our bid season we are encouraged by, but also the longer term discussions that we are having with our customers in general. Certainly, we have customers right now asking us for intermodal, a lot more of it. You mentioned fuel. That\u2019s part of it, but also just overall, our ability to service our customers in an efficient way in intermodal. The more we can do that, the more they want to do that. PSR has really created a pent-up demand from our customers over the last 5 years to 6 years. They had to move into the truckload market when really intermodal is the most efficient way to move goods. So, I see our customers continuing to lean in long-term, but that\u2019s not just in intermodal. That\u2019s long-term across all five of our segments. So, I see our customers adding two lengths of agreements and also talking to us across the fast services.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to ask you about how you think your businesses will respond to a down cycle. I mean it seems like the spot market data creates that concern. I guess it\u2019s hard to tell whether that continues or not. Maybe it\u2019s noise. Maybe it\u2019s a downturn. But do you think your businesses will react in a similar fashion to what they did in maybe 2015, \u201816 or 2019 when we saw prior downturns in freight, or do you think things are different for J.B. Hunt in terms of your biggest businesses and how they might respond to a downturn in freight if that plays out?\nShelley Simpson: Well, if you look at \u2013 I am going to call a downturn a recession from 2008 and 2009, really the last time you could see it dramatically in our business. Intermodal performed very well, and we would expect intermodal to continue to perform very well for our customers. It would be a great way for us to deliver more efficiency for them in cost servicing capacity. So, we see resiliency in our intermodal model. Certainly, we see resiliency in our dedicated model. Remember, in DCS, that business is really private fleet conversion business. So, when they made that decision, they know Joe and Sue coming into their facility on a regular basis, much like not an employee, but similar to representing their brand. And so that\u2019s a longer term discussion for our dedicated customers. I think in the highway services side, we are more variable this time than last time. So, in the last recession, we had a lot of trucks and a lot of trailers. Now we have a lot of trailing capacity that allows us to be flexible in the market with J.B. Hunt 360. So, both ICS and JBT will be able to be flexible in the market on creating the right cost servicing capacity for the right loads at the right time. And then in final mile, I think part of that business has a non-asset part to it, and part of it\u2019s on the asset part of the business. That\u2019s a growing sector, so I think it will continue to take share from a sector perspective. Nick, I would be curious if you have anything to add on that.\nNick Hobbs: No, I just think we have a lot of flexibility, depends on one of the four channels that we have and we can adjust our cost when we have the non-asset side. But on the asset side, we have contracts in place that help protect us there as the volume changes. So, we feel good about that. So, I think we are well protected.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Brad, if you can you talk about the scale, the size, the scope you are going to frame in terms of 360 in the platform in terms of profitability, in terms of loads, headcount, where do you think you are at this point relative to where you want to be in the next, call it, 2 years to 3 years? Clearly, the market tailwind from a margin perspective is a little bit edged back here, but maybe you can elaborate on that, especially when you think about the next step being accelerating the phase of the investment you have been through with those platforms? Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Yes, Brian, I appreciate the question. Just to build on what Shelley spoke of in her prepared comments, we just rolled into our 5-year anniversary of J.B. Hunt 360. And knowing that just in the last 12 months or from a Q1 versus Q1, we grew 36% on the platform, and so I do think that, that really speaks to us having made the foundation of the investment in the technology and then beginning to scale. And so, with revenue growth in JBT of 77% year-over-year, just outstanding performance in an area that for a long time had been relatively flat for us here at J.B. Hunt. So, the combination of our assets and non-asset models with live and drop inside of highway services and how we blend those networks together to create efficiencies and value for our customers, really, I am encouraged about where we sit today. As it relates to kind of where we are at in the environment as we speak today and not trying to predict what\u2019s in front of us, the variable nature of the power does give us flexibility. And so I do feel like we are going to be able to succeed in any environment, given the foundation of our trailing fleet investment, and we will look to continue to make investment there and grow that fleet. And if we can complement live freight into our network, it provides efficiency for our customers.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you for the question, Brian. And operator we have time for one more question.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for fitting me in here. Darren, I wanted to ask a little bit about the new intermodal containers coming into the network. How much of that is just backfilling what BN lost with Schneider and Knight sort of in existing sort of service lines? And how much of this is about maybe getting the railroads to stretch what they are comfortable doing, opening up new markets, that kind of thing? I am just trying to get a sense for how much of that capacity is just going into a market that\u2019s already served versus how much might be coming after some new growth opportunities?\nDarren Field: Well, I think it\u2019s hard to answer that. I would just say when we go out and acquire equipment like that, it\u2019s to grow with our customers to add new customers. I don\u2019t know that we are adding new markets. We are certainly more engaged with customers in discussing the transloading of their international intact intermodal business. So, that\u2019s certainly an opportunity for us to grow that isn\u2019t related to the channels that have exited BNSF. Look, we are also not na\u00efve. I mean, a lot of lift capacity is exiting BNSF. And so we are \u2013 we know that customers want to diversify their underlying rail providers. And so we have a host of customers that are talking to us about taking on business that maybe another channel handled in the past. So, I don\u2019t want to act like it\u2019s none. It\u2019s certainly a part of the decision, but it\u2019s certainly not all of it. I don\u2019t have a great answer to tell you, is it half, is it \u2013 we just want to grow and serve customers and do so at a return on our investment that warrants reinvestment, and we are very confident in our ability to do that.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks.\nOperator: The question-and-answer session has now ended. That concludes today\u2019s J.B. Hunt first quarter 2022 earnings webcast. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover the performance of our Highway Service businesses, which includes both integrated capacity solutions and trucks. We continue to see tremendous opportunity to leverage our investments in our people, assets and technology to support the growth opportunities presented to us by our customers. As evidenced by our results, I think we were able to demonstrate that in the first quarter. So with that, let me go ahead and dive into the performance of the segments that make up highway and provide some perspective on our priorities moving forward as well as some perspective on the market currently. I'd like to start with truck at JBT. Revenue grew 77% year-over-year to $264 million, while operating income improved to $31.5 million in the quarter. This represents some of the strongest quarterly performances in the segment going back to 2005, yet with less than 20% of the company trucks or assets than we had running in the segment at that time. This continues to support our decision to invest in trailing assets for this segment while leveraging our investments in our technology, specifically J.B. Hunt 360, to source the most efficient capacity to move freight for and on behalf of our customers. As Shelley mentioned in her comments, demand for our trailing assets, which is our 360box product, remains strong as customers continue to realize the efficiencies and benefits of giving us a holistic view of their freight and allow us to blend their live and drop trailer networks with a single-source solution. We continue to see strong customer demand for this product and service offering as they recognize these benefits. Going forward, we will continue to prioritize our investments in our people, growing our trailing fleet and leveraging our technology to support long-term sustainable growth in the segment while maintaining our financial discipline around acceptable returns on invested capital. To close out on JBT, you might have noticed an update to some of the stats we shared on this segment, which we believe better aligns with how the business has transformed with the introduction of our 360box service offering by managing a trailing capacity fleet and sourcing the most efficient capacity to move it for our customers, whether it's our truck or asset or someone else's. Shifting gears now to ICS. We delivered $675 million of revenue in the quarter with year-over-year growth of 29% versus the prior year period. This growth was driven by more balance between volumes and revenue per load than in our more recent periods as our segments volume grew 12% year-over-year. Specific to truckload volumes, our growth was 15% versus the prior year period. We have seen a moderation in spot opportunities as of late, which we attribute partly to more customer shifting freight out of the spot market into published or contractual business but also recognizing a movement in the market towards more balance. Taking that a step further for the quarter, our published business was up more than 20% while our spot business was up low single digits. That said, we continue to see record levels of freight opportunities from our customers to execute in our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, which we think demonstrates the power of our platform to source the most efficient means of moving freight for and on behalf of our customers. Going forward, we will continue to focus on leveraging our people and our technology to provide an efficient solution for our customers. We believe this will support our long-term growth and will be supported by fair and adequate returns on invested capital. In closing, I'd like to leave you with our confidence to continue to invest in the areas I've highlighted for you, and that is our trailing capacity, our people and our technology. We continue to see how each complements one another to provide the most efficient solution for our customers. Our customers have and always will remain focused on cost, capacity and service. And if we can differentiate ourselves and deliver on all three, we believe that is the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth. As we continue to deliver on our value proposition for customers, we stay true to our mission, to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments, so I'll turn it back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Yes, Brian, I appreciate the question. Just to build on what Shelley spoke of in her prepared comments, we just rolled into our 5-year anniversary of J.B. Hunt 360. And knowing that just in the last 12 months or from a Q1 versus Q1, we grew 36% on the platform, and so I do think that, that really speaks to us having made the foundation of the investment in the technology and then beginning to scale.

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments today will review our recent performance in the quarter, providing some additional perspective to the results on a consolidated level. I will provide a quick update on capital expenditure plans for the year and then I will spend a little bit more time talking about our priorities around our capital allocation in light of recent market events and opportunities we see to capitalize on long-term sustainable growth in our business. Overall, we are pleased with our performance for the first quarter of the year, highlighted by revenue growth of 33% and operating income growth of 61% versus the prior year period. These results were tempered by some fairly meaningful labor challenges at the start of the quarter related to Omicron variant outbreak. The most notable impact from this challenge was in our DCS business as driver availability and productivity were impacted. We also saw challenges in our rail velocity and intermodal and in product availability in our FMS network. That said, the market tightness presented our highway businesses opportunities to step in to meet customer needs and our technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, provided us an efficient and effective avenue to source capacity for and on behalf of our customers. This continues to prove out the resiliency of our multimodal business model and our broader mode agnostic supply chain solutions offering. We have discontinued providing COVID-related costs on a quarterly basis a few quarters ago as the numbers were not meaningful to our consolidated results, but we did incur a little over $7 million in direct COVID-related costs for paid time off for those needing the quarantine and also for those needing time to get vaccinated in the quarter. Weather also presented some challenges to our network businesses, but no more or less than what we had expected given our line of work. I would say, similar to my comments last quarter, labor continues to be an area with the greatest inflationary pressure in both professional driver and non-driver salary wages and benefits and we expect that trend to continue throughout the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $18 million of gains on sale of equipment in the quarter, which are atypical for us. We had very few trades last year as we hold most of our equipment to support our organic growth. Below the line, our tax rate was 24.4%, slightly lower, while our interest expense was modestly higher year-over-year, netting us to GAAP EPS of $2.29 or a 67% increase year-over-year. Continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet with $145 million of cash, zero drawn on our revolver and up to $750 million capacity on the revolver and our net debt balance remains below our targeted level of 1x trailing EBITDA at 0.6. Last quarter, I provided CapEx plans of $1.5 billion for the year. And while we are slightly behind plan through the first quarter due to continued constraints and equipment availability, $1.5 billion remains our target for 2022. A quick update on our capital allocation priorities is that it hasn't changed. We will continue to prioritize supporting the growth of our business with reinvestment as needed, remaining committed to our investments in capacity to help serve our growing customer base. We recently increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 a share or 33% from prior levels and keeping with our dividend strategy. We also intend to incorporate mindful share repurchases and opportunistically execute on M&A opportunities. We remain conservatively leveraged to maintain our investment-grade rating. However, we are not afraid to increase leverage as opportunities arise. I'd like to reemphasize that investments in our business will continue to be supported by sound financial discipline and maintaining fair and reasonable returns on our invested capital. This keeps our business strong, healthy and capable of growing to meet the growing needs of our customers. This concludes my remarks. And I will now turn it over to Shelley."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley and good afternoon. Today, I am going to review the performance of both our Dedicated and Final Mile segments as well as give some updated thoughts on current trends in some of our high level expectations as we move throughout the year. I will also provide some perspective on the current challenges we face and the industry are facing in sourcing both equipment and professional drivers. I will start my comments on Dedicated. At the expense of sounding like a broken record, our Dedicated business continues to have a lot of momentum as our backlog and pipeline for new business and startups continues to build to record levels. After coming off a record year of selling roughly 2,500 trucks in 2021, the first quarter kept pace with around 600 trucks sold in what is normally a slower time of the year for new business sales. As it pertains to the results in the quarter, revenue grew 28%, driven primarily by the average fleet size that was about 2,000 trucks or 20% larger than a year ago, which I believe is the true standout for our organization and in the industry. Margins in the quarter remained under pressure despite improving sequentially as a result of startup cost as we onboarded almost half the accounts in the first quarter than what we did all of last year. I will also share that our operations and productivity were negatively impacted by labor challenges brought on by Omicron variant in January and weather events in February. That only added to some of the startup expenses we incurred. That said and hopefully, with COVID and weather events largely behind us, we saw performance and momentum out of the segment in March, which we believe should carry forward. Our new accounts onboarded last year are performing as expected, which gives us confidence in our approach to the market and our annual price escalators will continue to protect us against broader inflationary pressures. Our concerns remain on both equipment and labor availability, namely professional drivers as our needs for both remain extremely elevated and may ultimately govern our pace of growth if demand remains or accelerates from current levels. In terms of priorities going forward, we will remain focused on the execution of our growth plan as well as maintaining our culture of operational excellence, high service and safety, which supports the value we deliver to our customers. Shifting to Final Mile, revenue grew about 8% versus previous year period, driven by newly awarded accounts over the last year, but offset by some of the supply chain challenges impacting some of the primary markets we serve in this segment, namely appliances and furniture. We also announced and closed on the acquisition of Zenith Freight Lines in the quarter, which contributed about $10 million in revenue for the one month it was consolidated in our results. We continue to make investments in our service quality and performance in order to differentiate ourselves in the market. We believe these investments are wise over the long-term as safety and service will be the cornerstone to our long-term growth and success. As we discussed last quarter, we are coming off a strong year of new business sales, giving us confidence in our differentiated service product. This confidence supported our decision to put some of our underperforming business at risk which we have done over the last few months. While it's too early to come to conclusions on all the underperforming accounts, we have been successful at getting meaningful rate increases at several accounts that should support better earnings and margin performance ahead. We remain focused on generating appropriate financial returns on our business so we can reinvest to provide more capacity and services for our customers. Going forward, our priorities remain investing in the business to support its growth, but with some greater emphasis on improving the profitability in this segment in 2022. Closing out with some operational updates. As I alluded to in my dedicated comments, the equipment market and professional driver market remain extremely tight. We have clearly had success growing our equipment levels and professional driver workforce to meet the most of the needs of our intermodal and dedicated businesses. But let me be clear, it hasn't been easy and it certainly hasn't been cheap. We have relied heavily on some of our key OEMs to help support our growth, but I am afraid it's not enough and we are exploring new suppliers across all of our areas of need to support our growth. That concludes my remarks. So I will turn it over to Darren. No, I just think we have a lot of flexibility, depends on one of the four channels that we have and we can adjust our cost when we have the non-asset side. But on the asset side, we have contracts in place that help protect us there as the volume changes. So, we feel good about that. So, I think we are well protected."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My commercial update will focus on general market conditions and how we are serving our customers' needs by leveraging our investments in our people, our physical assets and our multimodal digital freight platform, J.B. Hunt 360. I'll provide an update on this season, which will provide some insight into our expectations for the year. And finally, I will provide some priorities that our organization will be focused on achieving this year for our people and for and on behalf of our customers. As has been the case much of the last 2 years, the market remains extremely dynamic as also evidenced by our experience in the first quarter with disruptions across the supply chain related to the Omicron variant, weather events across the network, labor availability and rapidly rising fuel and commodity cost. We believe our mode-agnostic approach with our assets and technology platform, J.B. Hunt 360, both of which are powered and enabled by our people, allow us to dynamically meet and respond to the needs of our customers. As the quarter progressed, the market finally began to find more balance, which was evidenced by the expansion in margin we saw in our Highway Services segments. As we have discussed for some time, freight has been moving inefficiently over the last 2 years creating additional costs for our customers and additional costs for our business. 5 years ago, we launched internally our cycle of innovation to disrupt, adapt and to accelerate, which happened to coincide with the launch of J.B. Hunt 360. As we hit the 5-year anniversary for J.B. Hunt 360, I'd like to reflect on our journey and our investments. The investments we have made are intended to disrupt our industry. We, as an organization, had to adapt and make sure we had the right organizational structure and processes in place to execute our strategy. A month before the pandemic began, our organization transitioned to the theme, accelerate. Going forward, we will continue with our current theme to accelerate. We will accelerate the speed at which we serve our customers, accelerate our investments in areas with promising long-term growth potential, and accelerate our ability to react to the needs of our customers. Under this theme of acceleration, we will remain focused on opportunities to add value to our customers as our people, technology and assets come together to provide highly engineered cost-saving solutions. We believe this remains the right recipe for long-term compounding sustainable growth and we will continue to approach the market that way while maintaining our financial discipline on fair and appropriate returns on our capital. We are now almost halfway through bid season and we are extremely encouraged by the feedback and the confidence that our customers have in us to deliver an efficient and cost effective solution for their shipping needs. As we sit here today, demand for our services and in particular, the asset side of our business is the strongest I have seen in my 27-year career at the company and this demand continues to put pressure on our need for more equipment and people. Going forward, we have a lot of confidence in our plan to grow our capacity. And we believe it's a matter of when, not if, some of the labor challenges, which includes our rail providers, will moderate and ultimately assist us with improved fluidity. With elevated energy prices, customers are needing and expecting a lot from us, but capacity in an intermodal network remains extremely tight. Thankfully, our scroller services allow us to continue to offer capacity solutions and say yes to our customers with our ability to source that capacity in the marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. Finally, I want to take some time to provide you some of our priorities for the year. As I discussed last quarter, we believe that market dynamics will present us with a lot of opportunities to grow and that remains the case today as well as a priority. But I also believe our opportunity to provide and create efficiencies for our customers, is greater this year than at any point in the last 2 years. Our investments in our container fleet, trailing fleet, technology and people have us in the best position to provide the right solutions for our customers in three key areas: cost, capacity and service, more than any point since the beginning of this pandemic. I strongly believe in our team's ability to execute for and on behalf of our customers, delivering value and efficient solutions and this will remain our priority as well as it has always. This strategy, combined with our financial discipline, gives us even greater confidence as we have set out to achieve our mission to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. That concludes my comments. I'd now like to turn it over to Nick. Okay. Thank you, Chris. So I will say that there are varying signals in the market. And a lot of what you're hearing in the market is in the spot market, so small carrier capacity for the most part, and I think that's what's causing a lot of conversation. If you look across all of our five segments, you would see differing viewpoints inside the segments overall. I do think there has been a temporary relief in the dislocation from labor shortages and also just where shipments are located. We do forecast that to get a lot worse as we come into the summer months, particularly with what's happening in the supply chain from an ocean perspective or in China coming inbound. So we have had a lot of customers talk to us about that. Also, I did mention that our bid season is the best bid season that I have seen and very pleased with our customers leaning into us for solutions. I will say, if there is something that were to occur, and we see a lot of inefficiency in the market, we are constantly talking to our customers about what that is. That's why you hear us and have heard us talk about creating most efficient transportation network in North America because we see a lack of efficiency. Part of that's labor-driven, but another part of that is most of our customers have been primarily concerned with on-shelf availability, not as much around efficiency. So we see opportunity to help our customers increase payload and get freight into its most optimal mode. We happen to have the most optimal land transportation mode in intermodal. And so whether it's a downturn or even in the current environment, we do think there is a lot of freight from what we see in this season that can move into a more efficient mode like intermodal. But I would say across the segments, I think that there are cost and structural issues that will continue to remain. I think it's too early to say if there is anything happening with the consumer over the long-term. But certainly, we're watching all of those signals. I would tell you, customers are leaning into us more now even including the most recent data. So I think that would say there are more supply chain disruptions happening that could be lending to what we are seeing in the market today. Yes, Scott, so I'll take that first part. If you actually look at the live screen shot of what's happening in Shanghai, the ships are \u2013 it looks just like a lot of ships and a little bit of water. And so that certainly is going to make its way back into the U.S. here this summer. Our customers are concerned about the July time frame between that and also what's happening with labor at the port. I think there could be reason for concern or just reason to have different conversations. In this type of an environment just takes a little bit of disruption to really change the environment all over again. And so that's what we're watching out for. Okay. So, I think we noted that we are seeing strength, particularly in the asset part of our businesses. Part of that is because intermodal is the most efficient way to move business and dedicated really taking on a private fleet in a long-term agreement. But also in JBT and 360box, we are seeing significant growth, and our customers are really pushing us in that space. Part of that is labor challenge, but I think part of it is we are solving for a better way to do business more efficiently by utilizing the box. All of that's powered through J.B. Hunt 360. So, I think that's one of the biggest benefits we have seen through our technology is the growth that we have seen and also the value we create for our customers. In ICS, as margins were \u2013 or excuse me, if there were some kind of downturn, I think margins would change clearly from a margin expansion as most of our bids have been \u2013 are either locked in or about halfway through or so we will have pricing locked in for a large portion of that business. And then we are going to be flexible in the market from a spot perspective. That really goes across all of our businesses. Anywhere we have a chance to talk to our customers about being dynamic in pricing and capacity, we are going to do that on behalf of our customers. So, that will move with the market and then our contract pricing will stay relatively in line with whatever we finish in bid season. Thank you for that. I really should have mentioned it's not just our bid season we are encouraged by, but also the longer term discussions that we are having with our customers in general. Certainly, we have customers right now asking us for intermodal, a lot more of it. You mentioned fuel. That's part of it, but also just overall, our ability to service our customers in an efficient way in intermodal. The more we can do that, the more they want to do that. PSR has really created a pent-up demand from our customers over the last 5 years to 6 years. They had to move into the truckload market when really intermodal is the most efficient way to move goods. So, I see our customers continuing to lean in long-term, but that's not just in intermodal. That's long-term across all five of our segments. So, I see our customers adding two lengths of agreements and also talking to us across the fast services. Well, if you look at \u2013 I am going to call a downturn a recession from 2008 and 2009, really the last time you could see it dramatically in our business. Intermodal performed very well, and we would expect intermodal to continue to perform very well for our customers. It would be a great way for us to deliver more efficiency for them in cost servicing capacity. So, we see resiliency in our intermodal model. Certainly, we see resiliency in our dedicated model. Remember, in DCS, that business is really private fleet conversion business. So, when they made that decision, they know Joe and Sue coming into their facility on a regular basis, much like not an employee, but similar to representing their brand. And so that's a longer term discussion for our dedicated customers. I think in the highway services side, we are more variable this time than last time. So, in the last recession, we had a lot of trucks and a lot of trailers. Now we have a lot of trailing capacity that allows us to be flexible in the market with J.B. Hunt 360. So, both ICS and JBT will be able to be flexible in the market on creating the right cost servicing capacity for the right loads at the right time. And then in final mile, I think part of that business has a non-asset part to it, and part of it's on the asset part of the business. That's a growing sector, so I think it will continue to take share from a sector perspective. Nick, I would be curious if you have anything to add on that."

            "content": "Thank you, Nick and hello to everyone on the call. My comments this afternoon will recap the performance of our intermodal business in the quarter. I will also want to give some comments on our recent joint announcement with the BNSF to improve intermodal capacity challenges and what our priorities are for the business as we continue to invest in our people and capacity for meeting the strong and growing demand for intermodal services in the months, quarters and years ahead. I will start with the performance of the Intermodal segment in the quarter. Demand for the intermodal capacity remained extremely strong throughout the first quarter and importantly, it remains so today. As has been the case for some time, our ability to execute on all of the demand for our intermodal capacity was hampered by rail velocity and to a lesser extent, the retention of our equipment from customers. Box turns did deteriorate sequentially from fourth quarter, which is in line with seasonality, but nonetheless, still disappointing at current levels. The Omicron variant did impact labor availability for our rail providers and our customers and in our operations as well. And thankfully, those trends did improve as the quarter progressed, particularly for our customers as well as in our operations. Volumes for the month for the quarter were down 1% in January, plus 17% in February and plus 6% in March. Keep in mind, February was a fairly easy comp due to some weather events in 2021. We were successful at onboarding over 4,300 containers in the quarter and I am proud of our team for their execution on that front, which puts us in better position to meet the growing needs of our customers. We plan on taking delivery of the remaining balance of the 6,000 containers from our 2021 order during the second quarter. We did see approximately $14 million in gains on sale of equipment, which is unusual for us, but nonetheless should be transparently disclosed. Importantly, the core of our business is performing well in light of the inflationary and fluidity challenges facing the business and network, which is supported by our people running the operations and our customers who value our service offering. During the last quarter, J.B. Hunt and BNSF announced a joint initiative to substantially improve capacity in the intermodal marketplace while meeting the expanding needs of our current customers. This is an important moment for our organization as the largest railroad and domestic intermodal carrier will be collaborating even more closely together to provide an unparalleled intermodal product, leveraging the talents, skills and technologies of both companies to provide a seamless door-to-door solutions for our customers. With some channel partners leaving the BNSF network, we were provided an opportunity and have developed a plan to grow our intermodal container count to 150,000 in the next 3 to 5 years. This represents 40% growth from our count at the end of 2021. For the record, let me state the easiest thing we can do is go out and buy more containers. This will be a significant endeavor for our organization and will require investment in people, equipment and technology to get our desired outcomes. Importantly, these investments will be done with the same financial discipline as in the past. Needless to say, I'm excited and energized for our organization as we grow to meet the needs of our customers. As we look forward, I thought I would share a little bit of perspective about our priorities for Intermodal this year. As Shelley discussed, we are encouraged by the level of demand we are seeing throughout the bid process for our capacity, which continues to give us confidence to make investments. We strongly believe in the value proposition we can deliver on the three key items our customers care about, which is cost capacity and service. As it stands today, there are inefficiencies across the supply chain and within the rail network that is impacting velocity. We are cautiously optimistic that velocity will improve which will create more capacity for our customers while improving efficiencies and costs in our operations. Simply put, this is a good outcome for our rail providers, our customers and for J.B. Hunt. We will continue to prioritize investments needed to support our growth to help us meet the robust demand we are seeing for intermodal capacity. In closing, Intermodal's value proposition remains strong, supporting our view of long-term sustainable growth. We continue to see ample opportunities to convert highway freight as well as transloading cargo into our domestic containers. We believe our service backed by our people and the ownership of our equipment is differentiated in the market and even more so when combined with the power of the J.B. Hunt 360 platform that allows us to source capacity efficiently when needed. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. So somehow, Scott, snuck two questions in there, but I'll try to respond here. Spot prices in the truckload market have always been volatile over time. And we've seen times in the past when they rocketed up, times of really expensive or higher cost of fuel. And in this most recent 2-year window, I mean, spot prices for highway solutions have risen because in some cases, intermodal capacity was tapped out. And so all of a sudden, there is a much larger truckload spot market originating from the West Coast, for example. Those \u2013 the gap between that kind of rate and an intermodal price is north of 2x. I mean you're 200% higher to buy a spot-rated truckload solution off the West Coast versus an intermodal rate. So there is a very significant gap before truckload prices put any kind of pressure back on the intermodal market. So again, intermodal demand is extraordinarily high. We have more demand from customers than we currently have capacity to serve. And so I'm very encouraged by that demand cycle feel strongly that intermodal can continue to grow. And I don't really feel like, at this time, truckload rates falling is putting any pressure on intermodal pricing. Okay. Well, I appreciate that. We're proud of our results but not yet satisfied because we can actually grow more than that and demand is actually stronger for our product, and that gives us a lot of motivation, a lot of energy. So certainly, the new equipment we added last year and onboarded during the first quarter obviously contributed significantly to our growth. When I say we can grow more, I mean, 6 months ago, prior to the \u2013 midway through last year or even in the third quarter of last year, we would have anticipated stronger growth than we achieved, but that equipment we added really was consumed by weakness in velocity. And I don't want to beat a velocity drum here on the call all day today. Our rail providers all know that it needs to get better. They are all working very hard to improve that. We're very aware that they can improve that, fully anticipate that they will. The question remains when does that begin to show up. And certainly, during the first quarter, there were some challenges in that area. We're turning down thousands of loads per week and feel strongly that we have more volume to grow as velocity picks up. And again, we're very encouraged by the way we're communicating with both our customers as well as our rail providers. My goodness, Justin, you just asked for all of the answers there. So certainly, we've highlighted that returns drive our investment decisions. And that's not any different today with the announcement of the expansion of our equipment. I think that, that signals our belief in the long-term growth available in the intermodal system and that, that growth can come on board at the return profiles that we would expect. Now there comes a point at which whether or not it's accretive or you simply are just sustaining your return profile. I mean that's \u2013 there will be some small cycles whenever \u2013 if we get the opportunity to take cost out of our system, I could see a world where that transfers to prices that go back to the customers. And that's okay. We fully anticipate a velocity improvement \u2013 and that could very well result in prices going back a little bit to benefit the customers because, frankly, today, weakness in velocity has been considered inside the intermodal system. But I would certainly believe that we can sustain long-standing success with our ROIC. And we don't \u2013 and we're not willing to grow in a world that would damage that. That's the first thing that would slow down that investment. So that's a \u2013 that is core tenet number one at J.B. Hunt, and there will be no change to that. Okay. I appreciate the question. I am not going to call out anything specific in the agreement. I think it's really \u2013 obviously, it's of note that we made that release jointly. And BNSF's logo is on the same press release with ours, and that's because we are very aligned in our efforts around growth. We are aligned in our efforts around how we can use technology and build out our systems in a better way that allows both of us collectively to be more efficient on the hold. That could mean things like if we get an opportunity to take a load in the gate at a BNSF location and park it track side so we can eliminate a hostile move. We want to connect our technology so that the planners with BNSF have good visibility into loads that haven't yet picked up, but that are going to come in the gate later that day. And that's why you heard in some of the prepared comments that the easiest thing we can do is go buy containers. And that's very true. I mean, the mission we are on has a lot more to do with how we work together, how we work with our customers and how we solve long-term supply chain solutions together. And all of that effort drives into that decision on growing the capacity, whether it's in 3 years or 5 years. I mean certainly, the window is in there because we recognize that there has been a velocity loss in the system. And over these next couple of years, we anticipate a time when we can get velocity back. We would fully expect to do that. And if that gives us the opportunity to grow and maybe we didn't have to onboard quite as many containers in a given period, that's okay, too. I mean we are \u2013 we also highlighted that our ROIC is going to be the driving landmark behind how we do that. We are so confident in the market size and the magnitude of the opportunity, that's why we made that announcement, and we are more aligned than ever with BNSF and we are very energized by these \u2013 that announcement. I mean I think that it's a little bit hard to call. I mean again, we \u2013 our commentary on box turns had a lot more to do with velocity challenges, not from anything going on in China. Certainly, demand is very strong. And so we are encouraged by that and would anticipate that box turns will improve as velocity improves. So first of all, there is not a new agreement with BNSF, I want to be clear about that. We have had a long, long-term agreement with BNSF, and we are energized by the work we are doing together as we have been energized by that for 30-plus years now. The growth is going to come organically from our customers. The growth is going to come from significant inefficiency in the networks today where truckload business is moving intermodal that should be intermodal. And lastly, there continues to be a really significant effort amongst some of our customers to grow their transload business and take international intact off of the railroad and replace that with domestic intermodal, and that certainly can present some additional efficiency for our customers. So, we always look to grow in that way. We don't look to grow by just going out in a pricing site with the host of intermodal channels. We believe strongly in presenting supply chain solutions to our customers. And that's going to drive a behavior change or a mode change in the way they are executing it. There will certainly always be business that's in the bid that other people handle. But our mission to grow is off the highway and transload and organic growth with our existing customers. Well, I will just quickly start with your second question and say it took us the better part of 3 years or 4 years to change our margin target. We don't have an update for you today. Certainly, it's our mission to be focused on our return on invested capital. And that's what we are focused on and the margin turns out to be kind of an output from that. I don't have a good way to describe the turn number coming out of the quarter. What I would just say is we highlighted that volumes were still slightly negative in January, and then we started to experience growth as the quarter went on. We did onboard new equipment as the quarter went on, and we are not satisfied with our turn number, but we are encouraged by what we have seen from our customers, and we are beginning to have \u2013 we are encouraged by what we are seeing from the rail network today. But it's nowhere near getting back to where it was prior to the pandemic. So, we have a long ways to go in that area. But there is no lack of motivation from our rail providers to improve their velocity. So, as that goes, we are going to continue to work on box turns. That will be a subject forever. But until we can get an improvement in box turns, we have to consider the cost of the ownership of that equipment at the weaker velocity until we can get an improvement. And at that point, I am certain you will see those results in our results. Well, I think it's hard to answer that. I would just say when we go out and acquire equipment like that, it's to grow with our customers to add new customers. I don't know that we are adding new markets. We are certainly more engaged with customers in discussing the transloading of their international intact intermodal business. So, that's certainly an opportunity for us to grow that isn't related to the channels that have exited BNSF. Look, we are also not nai\u0308ve. I mean, a lot of lift capacity is exiting BNSF. And so we are \u2013 we know that customers want to diversify their underlying rail providers. And so we have a host of customers that are talking to us about taking on business that maybe another channel handled in the past. So, I don't want to act like it's none. It's certainly a part of the decision, but it's certainly not all of it. I don't have a great answer to tell you, is it half, is it \u2013 we just want to grow and serve customers and do so at a return on our investment that warrants reinvestment, and we are very confident in our ability to do that."

            "content": "Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call today. We see the start of 2022 and this first quarter's report is both encouraging and revealing. While overall labor and other supply chain issues have continued, we leveraged experience, focus and technology to move through this period with success. Execution across all disciplines within the organization is running at solid performance levels, yet we have clear opportunities for improvement. Our equipment utilization continues to underperform due to consistent challenges with philosophy and the persistent need for new driver hires. We added 1,889 net drivers during 2021 and have so far increased our driver force by just over 1,400 this year. Our hiring teams are built out to levels not seen before in our history. The increased ability to improve hiring performance are enabled by the increases in driver compensation, improved benefits, reliable schedules with predictable home time and a company environment centered on growth for future career expansion. For the past 18 months, our entire people and human resources discipline has been in a comprehensive refresh, presenting the opportunity to make meaningful changes in the quality of services these capable teams can bring to the most critical area of our business, all of our people, current and new. As noted, we announced a multiyear expansion plan for our intermodal fleet recently, coinciding with the renewed commitment between BNSF and JBHT. The opportunities that lie ahead in serving our customers are rejuvenated by this commitment and we anticipate leveraging this unique and industry-leading position. The transportation dynamics of driver shortages and increasing labor costs, high fuel prices, congestion, reliable capacity, not to mention the remarkable impacts that intermodal has in the Scope 3 emission reductions for our shippers gives us confidence in our decisions here. Another important recent development is the formation of our Inclusion Council consisting of a highly cross-functional group of managers and executives whose purpose is to continue to guide the organization towards new awareness and actions. This will no doubt make us a better company. Our leadership team is here and will cover each business more specifically for you. But before that, I will turn the call over to John Kuhlow for his thoughts on the quarter. John? Yes. The big challenge and what it limits really is we are having to use hold trucks for up to six months and to help us increase our capacity just because of the chip shortages and other components that the OEMs are facing right now. So, we are addressing that. Right now, it's not limiting us other than it's pushing what would normally be a 90-day start-up up to 120 days. So, that's pushing out some start-ups a little bit longer. But at this point, it's not really limiting us for many deals. Our pipeline is still very strong. It's just pushing them out probably another 30 days from what we would normally have out there. We are having good conversations with OEMs, but none of them have any extra capacity at this point. Thank you for the question, Brian. And operator we have time for one more question."

I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to hit on a couple of topics before I turn it over to our team to discuss our results and how we are investing and managing the business. We remain long-term focused and we'll continue to do so while being disciplined in our approach. I'm a believer in taking the bad with the good and the good with the bad, so let's start with the bad, as well as the obvious. On the topic of Insurance, we have been routinely covering with you the inflationary cost headwinds we faced as a Company, as well as an industry in the areas of professional driver and non-driver wages, healthcare benefits, and equipment cost. However, as an industry, we are also seeing unprecedented pressure in the area of claims, cost, or settlements. As you saw in our release, we incurred $53 million of additional costs in the quarter, largely related to higher claims cost and exceeding coverage limits in certain insurance layers. And this, despite 2023 being the Company's best performance in history on safety, measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. We remain one of the safest carriers in the industry. Yet our insurance rates continued to increase as the industry experiences higher virdicts, and as a result, higher litigation settlements. During verdicts in trucking cases where the verdicts exceed $1 million, have seen an 867% increase in the average size of verdicts from 2010 to 2018. This is according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform. Given that the majority of motor carriers in the industry carry only $1 million in coverage, just above the legal minimum of $750,000 in coverage, it's the larger carriers who bear the brunt or disproportionate share of the escalating insurance and claims cost and ultimately these inflationary costs get passed on to customers and consumers. As you've heard from us repeatedly, we are continuously focused on our safety performance and you've heard updates from Nick on our latest investments in this area. Our intense focus on safety and our investments in the latest safety technology and compliant equipment helps to protect our drivers, the motoring public, the environment, our customers, and your investments. We remain steadfast and committed to the safety of our people and the motoring public and will continue to invest in the latest technologies and training to support these efforts. On the freight environment, we have turned the page on 2023, goodbye and good riddance. As you are aware, 2023 presented many challenges, but I am very proud of our team and their perseverance in how they responded to these challenges. The experience of our leaders and the investments made during this downturn, I am confident, will drive long-term value for the Company. While the New Year has begun and the calendar has flipped to another page, not much has changed in regard to the freight environment. While we see opportunities across all of our businesses, good work is needed in the areas of revenue quality, controlling cost, and execution to earn an appropriate return while delivering value to our customers. We remain committed to our focus on return on invested capital and managing for the long-term, but the freight environment remains in a challenged state. With all of that out of the way, I am truly encouraged by our team's collective efforts and the opportunities presented across all of our businesses and for our relative performance in this market for 2023. Intermodal is seeing some momentum on the volume side the last few quarters and our work with BNSF and our other rail providers presents opportunities for growth in our future. Dedicated continues to be a steady performer, and along with Final Mile both had record years in segment operating income performance. And while ICS and JBT has faced the brunt of the market challenges, we still see great opportunity to scale our investments in technology, to drive efficiency in our customer supply chain in both our brokerage and power only offerings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As we've navigated through 2023, we remain committed to our strategic areas of focus, including investing in our people, technology and capacity. Our people have and always will come first and I'm proud of the commitment to our people, while continuing to invest in capacity for our network as we prepare to grow with our customers to meet their demand over the years ahead. The experience and talents of our people and our capacity to deliver are connected and enhanced by our technology investments, which combined together, would allow us to deliver exceptional value for our customers. As we have discussed the past couple of quarters and as John discussed, we remain in a challenging environment, but we continue to see some signs of improvement, especially related to intermodal volumes. Having said that, I think it's important to reiterate the volume is historically a leading indicator while price is typically a lagging indicator with uncertainty around the timing of any potential inflection. Going forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for and grow with our customers over the long-term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As we look to 2024 and the uncertain market dynamics, our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. While we are long-term focused, we are not satisfied with the current results in our business, especially the return performance across our business segments. Intermodal is seeing positive volume growth, but the impact of pricing during the last bid season will be with us through at least the first half of this year. Dedicated margins were resilient in 2023, but the impact of truck count losses and lack of fleet growth will make top and bottom line growth more challenging this year. Final Mile is holding up well despite tepid demand in our end markets. Our Brokerage and Power Only businesses are under significant pressure on both volume and price and continue to feel the brunt of the freight market as evidenced by the performance. We are focused on controlling what we can control and remaining flexible to deliver the best value for our customers. This is where our go-to-market strategy and mode in different service offering can help customers lower cost. We can save customers\u2019 money by converting over-the-road shipments to Intermodal, which is cheaper and less carbon intensive. We can create the most efficient dedicated fleets or leverage our technology through our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity to drive value and differentiate the end experience for our customers' customer in our Final Mile network. In closing, I want to highlight our areas of strategic focus for 2024. First, we are focused on operational excellence to deliver exceptional value to our customers. While service levels are strong, we believe consistent and quality service will further differentiate us from peers and support our ability to win market share at acceptable returns. Second, we will continue to scale our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity. This isn't something new for us and our commitment to investment in these three areas further position us for long-term growth with our customers as the market recovers. And third, we want to remain focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. We operate in a cyclical market with ups and downs, but over the long-term, we believe our mode in different approach offers customers the most options to deliver the greatest value and solve for their needs, ultimately supporting our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and fiscal year and will include more color on the insurance expense impact on the quarter as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, outside of Intermodal and to a lesser extent Final Mile, we didn't see many signs of a peak season in the quarter. Starting with our fourth-quarter results, on a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%, operating income declined 28% and diluted earnings per share decreased 23%. The declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes in our yields combined with inflationary cost pressures. Our fourth-quarter results include a $53 million charge or $0.38 per diluted share related to higher insurance and claims expense primarily related to negative developments of claims and exceeding coverage limits in certain insurance layers. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the fourth quarter last year as certain claims from prior incidents continue to settle at much higher amounts than we have historically experienced. For the full-year 2023, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue declined 13%, operating income declined 25%, diluted earnings per share decreased 24%. These full-year results include the impact of the insurance charge I outlined previously. Looking to 2024, we expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in the areas of insurance premiums, capital and people costs. Part of the increase in insurance relates to increases in underlying premiums largely due to market conditions, but also to provide greater coverage across the businesses. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged below our target of one times debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA and maintain flexibility with our credit facility that has ample borrowing capacity, if needed. Looking into 2024, we are planning for net capital expenditures between $800 million and $1 billion. Going a level deeper, our 2024 capital plan assumes $250 million to $300 million for new power equipment, primarily in Intermodal and dedicated and $250 million to $300 million for new trailing equipment which includes containers, chassis and trailers. We also expect to deploy $300 million to $350 million for real-estate and other investments, including technology. In addition, our capital allocation plan in 2024 contemplates continued support of our dividend and we expect to take advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares when they present themselves, all while maintaining our leverage ratio around one times EBITDA. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the fourth-quarter, I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results despite the approximately $20 million of insurance-related expense incurred in this segment. Even with the challenging freight environment in 2023, our dedicated business had a record year in both revenue and operating income. Demand for professional, outsourced, private fleet solutions has held up well and we sold approximately 300 trucks of new deals during the fourth-quarter, bringing our full-year sales number to approximately 1,150 trucks. Our pipeline remains strong, but we do have some visibility into fleet losses and/or downsizes throughout 2024 and are working hard to backfill these by executing on that pipeline. Importantly, we are remaining disciplined in pricing new opportunities to ensure we maintain our required rates of return. While 2023 was a challenging year, from a fleet growth perspective, I want to put some context around the work we have done to improve the overall strength and durability of our business. While we have experienced downsizing a lot of our fleets, we even lost the handful of accounts over the last year. The percent of portfolio that churned in 2023 was about half of what we saw in 2009 during the Great Recession. Our focus on private fleet and our customer value delivery process, CVD, that was established from our experience during that time, set us up for better performance during this downturn. As we look to 2024, our strategic focus includes continuing to scale the business, create value for customers, and to leverage our density to help offset inflationary cost pressures, all while executing on behalf of our customers in the safest manner possible. Moving to Final Mile. We have made good progress on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio, and our strong service metrics highlight the value we create for and on behalf of our customers. Our year-over-year change in profitability continues to outpace the change in revenue despite incurring $3 million in additional insurance-related expense in the quarter. Demand for big and bulky products overall remains muted, particularly in furniture, but we did see a seasonal lift in demand for exercise equipment around the holidays. Our focus in this business remains on providing the highest-quality service for the delivery of big and bulky items into the homes of our customer's customer. This service-oriented focus resonates well in the market and we are seeing new brands engaging in discussions with our team. As we move into 2024, we're focused on growing and scaling the business and building on the solid foundation that we have. We will also remain disciplined on revenue quality while focusing on operational excellence and execution for our customers and their customers in a safe, secured manner. Similar to last quarter's, I'll close with some comments on safety in our equipment. Aligning with our Company foundation of taking care of our people, but also the motoring public, we want to continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 60% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras in our fleet with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. As a Company, we had our best safety performance in our history in 2023 measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. As you have heard, the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially, so we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk where possible. Lastly, on equipment, we have cleaned out our older equipment and feel our fleet is refreshed and in good position heading into 2024. You heard John Kuhlow give you a range on CapEx, which reflects our better position on equipment age. This concludes my remarks, but I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have, to deliver value for our customers and all our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. As you heard, we remain in a challenging freight environment, but we have been seeing improving trends in Intermodal since this Spring, which continued as evidenced by our 6% increase in volume for the quarter. In fact, we have seen an improvement in our year-over-year monthly volume trends since April or for nine consecutive months. By month in the fourth quarter, our volumes were up 6% in October, 6% in November, and up 8% in December. During the quarter, we saw a peak season in Intermodal that neither we, or our customers, nor our rail providers were expecting, yet we were able to solve for our customers' capacity needs while maintaining high service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. While we are encouraged by the volume trends we are seeing, it is worth reiterating that volume is historically a leading indicator, while price is typically a lagging indicator. We continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share from the highway. During the quarter, we saw margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the impact of bids priced in prior periods and also, our results in the fourth quarter included approximately $16 million of higher insurance-related expense. We are currently in the early innings of bid season for 2024 and believe it is too early to comment on our expectations or the success of bid so far. Given our strong service levels and the unique value our Intermodal network can provide, we are working with customers to ensure this value is realized and that we earn an acceptable return on our investments to meet and serve their capacity needs. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the Intermodal offering, and growing the overall market. We remain encouraged by the work we are doing with BNSF in the West and the collaboration between our companies. We announced our new Quantum offering during the quarter. We are very excited about this service and the potential to expand the Intermodal market by working with customers that have service-sensitive freight. During the quarter, we also announced our new Intermodal service out of Mexico with GMXT through the Eagle Pass gateway connecting with BNSF. This gives our customers more options to solve their cross-border capacity needs, leveraging the networks of both GMXT and BNSF. In closing, our focus for 2024 will be on regaining share from the over-the-road market, scaling our business to better leverage our assets and investments, and delivering excellent operational execution for and on behalf of our customers. We strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and improved ways to better serve their transportation needs. We have the people, technology, and capacity in the network to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today and remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient, cost-competitive, and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, as well as provide an update on J.B Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains very competitive from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by a 12% decline in volume and a 15% decline in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. The acquisition contributed a little over $90 million of revenue to our performance in the quarter. Similar to prior quarters, overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market, remains depressed versus the same period last year. While we aren't pleased with the current results in ICS, we are taking steps that will position us for better success in the future. We have focused our efforts on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio and calling some unprofitable freight which contributed to the lower volume in the quarter. We believe we are out in front of the market with some of our work on rates, but it is too early in the bid season process to fully gauge our performance. We are investing in areas to mitigate strategic theft and enhance capabilities in our platform, while rightsizing resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall, we do believe these changes will position us for better long-term growth and success. Looking at 2024, in ICS, we are focused on quality volume growth that recognizes the value and quality service we provide in the market and rightsizing our cost structure further, to align with activity levels, either through scaling or attrition. We're also focused on premier execution across the business through reliable, excellent service, high on-time performance, and further strategic theft mitigation. Moving over to JBT or Truckload, segment gross revenue was down 19% year-over-year, driven by a 13% decline in revenue per load, and a 7% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering is outperforming the market, as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. The flexibility that we can provide customers by combining dropped trailer capacity with the ability to source the carrier to move the load on the J.B Hunt 360 platform is key and resonates well with our customers. Going into 2024, we are focused on improving the efficiency of our network through increased trailer turns, essentially creating additional capacity on our network without having to add a significant amount of assets. We are also focused on maintaining balance across the trailer network to ensure our assets are in the correct place to meet customer demand and continuing to grow while making sure the overall revenue quality of our portfolio remains healthy. I'll close with some comments on 360. Our investments in our company foundations, our people, technology and capacity remain a focus for us. Technology-enables our people, helps drive productivity and also drives efficiency and how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Despite the challenging freight environment and depressed demand, we continue to see improved productivity in our people-driven by 360 platform. It is just matched to some degree by the current market conditions. That said, as our cost structure is becoming more aligned with current demand, we continue to believe our technology will drive productivity and efficiency gains as the market recovers, allowing us to meet higher customer demand levels without having to had as many resources, while providing high levels of service for our customers. We know that investing in our people, technology and capacity is key to our success and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thanks, Brad. Hey, Krista, let's open the call for just one question without follow-ups given the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Darren or Shelley, you guys mentioned a couple of times about how pricing is just a lagged indicator and volume being the lead here. I know your volumes did accelerate in Intermodal business this quarter. I guess, how can you help us think about the progression on operating profitability through 2024? Are you going to have the ability to get that value and greater yield from your customers as the year progresses?\nDarren Field: So, Brandon, I'll start. This is Darren. Certainly, I'm not going to guide you into 2024. What I will say is pricing will forever be worth more than volume in terms of margin performance and return performance. We are under immense cost pressure. And certainly, we believe the value proposition we represent to our customers should equate to a return position that justifies our investments. There's a lot yet to be determined and -- as we go through the bid cycle and so the answer to your question is we'll play itself out in 2024 and we're all going to have to wait and see what the environment is like.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Good afternoon. Hey, Darren. Just a follow-up on kind of the cost pressures just to understand kind of margin impacts. You talked about pulling containers out as you get growth. Maybe walk us through how we should think about the cost implications of bringing those containers back into business. When that should slow down? When we could see the, I guess, then the margin, I guess, benefit as you slow down bringing those costs out? And then to understand the insurance impact, if that's now an ongoing cost, are you raising that part? I'm trying to understand the cost inflation that we should expect in the business. Thanks.\nDarren Field: Sure. Well, I don't know that -- when I highlight cost pressures, I wasn't intending to just highlight taking containers in and out of storage. I mean, just inflationary cost pressures from wages for our drivers are higher, rates with our railroads are higher. Certainly, just all employment costs, maintenance the equipment itself cost more. Just across-the-board, we have cost increases and that inflationary cost lives across our enterprise, not just Intermodal certainly. And so those are challenges that we're all faced with. It's certainly the same thing that our customers are faced with. And that's why we're working with our customers to deliver more value and look for how do we partner together and take cost out of each other system as we move forward. And in terms of when, you get to see that, just like the last question. We're just going to have to wait and see until we can get the volume growing on a steady base and get the pricing cycle behind us. We don't know exactly what to expect in that. We know that the service quality we built in 2023 has earned us the right to really dialog with our customers around these cost challenges we're faced with.\nJohn Kuhlow: Hey. And Ken, this is John Kuhlow. I'll just add. On the insurance cost pressure that we're seeing, our general approach to risk management is to maintain coverage and insurance policies for our exposures. And as we reset the premiums going into 2024, we saw upwards of 50% to 60% increases in those premiums. And so when we talk about the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in 2024, it's mostly around our premiums. We've done a great job this year and working and focusing on safety to try to bring those incidents down. But the claims costs of the individual claims is what's driving a lot of the inflationary pressures.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: So if you add back the charges for insurance and the losses on equipment sales, you actually saw a pretty nice seasonal lift in operating income versus your history for the fourth quarter. And I know you don't want to give guidance because we think about just level-setting expectations for next year, is that typical 4Q to 1Q seasonal decline a decent place to start? Maybe if you could just sort of talk about puts or takes to that from that adjusted $270 million or so operating income adding back those charges in the fourth quarter. Thank you.\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Bascome, this is Brad. I'll give a shot at this. First, I mean, you guys treat insurance how you want. I think the intent of sharing the $50 million change in net loss on sale of equipment was more of a year-over-year comment versus sequential, and I don't have that in front of me to share. In terms of what you should expect from 4Q to 1Q, while there's still a lot of 1Q left, we don't typically provide guidance. So I'm sure over the course of the quarter, you and the market will inform itself on kind of what's happening. But as you've heard from our executive team, there's a lot of things that we're working on making sure we're delivering value for customers and making sure we're focused on getting ourselves to earning the right return on our investments and that will be the focus going forward and we'll just have to compete in the market that's given to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, good afternoon. So, Darren, I heard you talk about taking share from trucks, didn't hear you talk too much about West Coast port share gains. I guess, I'm wondering how you think you may or may not benefit from that. And then on the Intermodal pricing side, I'm guessing you're -- I mean, I hear you're not seeing much. Maybe I'll ask it this way. Do you think we need to wait for truckload pricing to start going higher for Intermodal pricing to go higher too? Or just given this improved Intermodal demand environment, can we see a decoupling where Intermodal pricing goes up without -- before truckload pricing starts to go up?\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Well, thanks for the two questions, Scott. So, when it comes to volume and looking to regain share from the highway, certainly that feels like some of the lowest fruit for us given the loss of share over, I'm going to call it, several years back into PSR time window, even through certainly the pandemic, I think Intermodal lost some share due to weakness in velocity. And as we gain velocity in 2023, we feel like we can better compete for our customers on consistency in the transit model that the customers need. So that's why we largely highlight highway conversions. Certainly, growth of import traffics through the West Coast ports is an absolute benefit to J.B. Hunt. Certainly, I think we highlighted in the earnings release that we grew Transcon 13% in the fourth-quarter. So that I would think highlights at least some advantage of that effort from growth of imports. As it relates to decoupling highway pricing to Intermodal pricing, I think that between our Transcon networks and our Eastern networks, there is already some decoupling, not 100%. Certainly the influence of the Intermodal market out West is a bigger factor in pricing there than highway rates. But in the eastern network, I can't imagine a world where Intermodal pricing would ever decouple from highway pricing in the eastern network. They really will be tied together.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, I'm going to stick with you. You mentioned that the fourth quarter volume number surprised everybody, yourselves, your rail partners, sounds like even your shippers. Maybe the most surprising part of the fact that December accelerated more, up 8%, which kind of goes contrary to what we've heard from all the others in the segment. What kind of happened in December that you think was kind of unique to J.B. Hunt, on that last question, was it more kind of your new services, your new services at the end, or just an easier comp? Just trying to figure out why the acceleration when it sounded like December was soft for everyone else.\nDarren Field: Yes. Okay. I appreciate the question. I think that certainly the new services, we're excited about. I don't want to -- the Mexico service announcement was a conversion from business we were handling through a different method, so I don't want that to be portrayed as an immediate growth movement. But as we move forward, it solidifies our capacity plans for Mexico to allow us to grow further in the long-term, over the long-term future. And when I think about December, the comp was certainly easier. I think that is a factor. I also believe that our mix of customers and the particular group of shippers we serve, had a more significant peak season that they even predicted and that's really why we've highlighted that the peak season was a surprise. And I'll even go as far as to say, our capacity, what I call the coiled spring for many quarters, solved for us this fourth quarter and that peak season, it really allowed us to execute for our customers at a very high level and we're really, really proud of that. I'm extremely proud of my team and I want to make sure and say that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And maybe I'll pivot and ask a Dedicated question for Nick. I know there are lot of moving pieces with some fleet losses and downsizes in the last year or so, but Dedicated has been pretty resilient as well. When you put it all together, any initial expectations on the level of fleet growth for Dedicated this year? And anything outside of insurance that we should be aware of as it relates to swing factors on costs with depreciation, start-up costs, or anything else?\nNick Hobbs: Yes. I would say, just as I was thinking about and reflecting back on this year that I think we performed much better than we did in 2008 and 2009, and I've talked about that, just the structure of our deals, CVD, and we lost 18% of our fleet in 2009 and didn't lose 9% -- or we did lose 9%. And so, I think through that, we've got a better base of business, better diversified, so I feel we've come out of that pretty good, sets up well. I would say though that when I think about our sales, I'm just going to give you our standard line of, we're going to sell a 1000 to 1200 trucks, just like we did last year in a really tough year. We're going to plan on doing that again. And as I said, we've got some visibility to some fleet losses coming up. And so, there is a lot of moving parts in there. But when I look at the market and what we're after, the private fleet market, it's really pretty stable. We've -- some of the losses have been in our more what I would call, our business that we've had, legacy business, for quite some time. And so, I think our base will get more solid as we move forward with more private fleets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hey, everybody. Darren, I just want to understand that volume momentum question, you're talking about volume momentum, obviously Intermodal loads were up 3% sequentially 3Q to 4Q. Usually, they go down 4Q to 1Q, but obviously, there is momentum. You're adding the Quantum service. Do we think that that momentum can continue where you can build volumes sequentially as we move through this year? And I'm really talking about the first quarter, because obviously, it's a seasonally tough quarter. And then just related to that, I assume your customers were talking about expectations for March and the Spring selling season. There's a lot of disruption in the Red Sea. And maybe, customers are rethinking their supply chains. Panama Canal and Suez Canal are down basically. So, just talk to us about that momentum building as we move over the next three months from where you are today. And then, what are your customers telling you from expectations on March and the disruption that's happening right now in the Red Sea? Thanks.\nDarren Field: That was impressive, Amit. I think that, look, as volumes came at us in the fourth quarter and like we've highlighted many times, our customers were even surprised by that. So, I think that the volume momentum that built during that quarter was largely related to activities that those customers had going on in the fourth quarter. And again, because they were surprised by it, I think that's why we feel a little bit more unclear right now about what the early part of this year holds. Certainly, traditionally, the first quarter is a drop-down from the fourth quarter. I would say that for my entire career, that's been the case and so I don't know that I am going to guide you on what will happen, but certainly, our customers' inability to tell us about the peak season continues to be a challenge for us to get good solid information about what to expect.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about cost inflation and maybe tie it into the insurance. And so I want to get some -- just trying to understand. We've got two years with fourth quarter hits from the insurance side. And I guess I'm trying to figure out what that means for the go-forward periods. So does the charge that you take in this fourth quarter mean that there is some degree of incremental approvals that are required for 2024? And then, maybe if we could just tie that into the broader cost inflation. If you look at the portfolio of the businesses, where do we think cost inflation is kind of running as we're getting into 2024?\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes. Well Chris, I'll take that, again. It's John Kuhlow. With respect to the insurance, we did have a charge last year in the fourth quarter. This really relates to continuing to see what we refer to as unprecedented settlements in our prior year claims. We had a situation where we ran out of our coverage limits in those periods. And so, we're effectively self-insured. Each quarter, we go through and we assess our reserves and working with our actuaries, we needed -- we determined that we need to take up our reserves. Can't say that this will never happen again, but we do believe that the charge that we took for our reserves, that makes them properly valued now. As I mentioned before, we do -- our approach is to maintain coverage for all of our businesses. And we are taking that up and we did a little bit in 2023 and taking that up in 2024 and going forward. Just to give -- with respect to the current environment and how we're seeing these settlements claimed, so -- or how we see these claims settled. So, that's really where we're seeing the most pressure. We are again continuing to look at our reserves on a quarterly basis. But I feel like most of the inflation that we're seeing is through the cost premiums that we have from our underwriters.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good evening. Just want to go back, Nick, to the Dedicated, the fleet downsizing, I know it was less than sort of the 2009, but what's your visibility on being able to reallocate that capacity fairly quickly? And then you also talked along that there was a pipeline of opportunities. Anything specific about the verticals of those opportunities that may be more defensible, or is it people just sort of preparing for whatever inflection may come here, just any thoughts? Thanks.\nNick Hobbs: Hey, Al. First of all, I would say, on our ability to replace some -- clearly, the way our business works is, we usually have waves when we get start-up so we incur the cost. And so, with us losing some of our trucks in 2023, we don't have the momentum we normally have going into 2024, and so we replaced them quickly, but it just takes a little time to kind of get the momentum and get the revenue and the profitability up and going. So, that's the reason that we're talking about 2024 the way we are. Now, as far as any vertical, we looked through our book. I would say, on the furniture side, we had a little bit of that in dedicated. It's impacted some. But I would say that one that's probably been the strongest has been the grocery side of things have just been consistent throughout. And then the others, it's kind of -- just as the economy is going, they're kind of going. Nothing really sticks out anywhere else.\nBrad Delco: And Allison, this is Brad Delco. I'm sorry. I just want to add -- touch to that on your question about kind of the churn that Nick shared before. We share each quarter the success the team had selling new fleets. And so Nick kind of shared a churn number of 9% on our -- on the base of the fleet in 2023. The team was very successful in backfilling some of those losses by selling, that could be into new deals and so. I think that what the best messaging is effectively, hey, we have some foresight into some, downsizing of some fleets in 2024. And I think in his prepared remarks, he said, hey, the strategic focus is going to be out there selling to backfill some of those losses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Just regarding this insurance situation going, obviously, it seems a little bit frustrating given how much it's outside of your control. Is legislation in Congress the only answer to this? Do you think some of the technology you're putting in place is going to have a tangible impact on reducing some of these claims? And is there anything you guys can do as a large carrier to maybe avoid some of the disproportionate impact on large carrier versus small ones?\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, I'll jump in and this is Nick. Clearly, we think we had record safety year when we look at DOT preventables for the entire organization and we're very pleased with that. We're doing things like -- and we're placing cameras. We're about 65% complete on that rollout. We will have all of those other trucks [retro'ed] (ph) by the end of Q3. So, we clearly think that will help us with our accidents. And then if you think we're also -- we got 65% of our fleet that's got Side Guard Assist that helps us on the right side. Those we can't retro, this is going to take us another couple of years. So we think we're out leading well on the safety side, but the fact is that the individual claims are just going through the roof and the cost of those. And quite honestly, those are in state courts. And so it's a state-by-state that's got to be addressed. We're working with the American Trucking Association and trying to go state-by-state to get tort reform. So, it's going to be a long battle there unless there is some federal legislation that would kind of help us interstate truckers out there. So, John, I don't know if you want to --\nJohn Kuhlow: Hi, Ravi. I'd just add, it is frustrating, but we are focused on the areas that we can control. And as Nick said, we're working to do everything we can to improve our safety to make sure that the incidents themselves are down. And then there needs to be something done with respect to the settlement charges.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Maybe sort of switch it up a little bit on the brokerage side of the equation, obviously still a lot of pressure there profit wise. I mean what do you think needs to happen to get back in black? Is it purely a cycle thing, price and volume or is there is some things you need to do structurally to whether it'd be cost or technology? I know you made a lot of investments in the past, but maybe talk a little bit truck brokerage and your thinking on return to profitability.\nBrad Hicks: Yeah, Jordan, thank you. It's Brad Hicks. It's incredibly difficult brokerage environment as we will note throughout the entire year. We did spend a tremendous amount of time focused on our cost as we saw volume decline and revenue quality back up significantly. Maybe it's extremely difficult through the bid season that really pick your spots in an ever so declining rate environment. And I do feel like last quarter or quarter and a half, we've been just kind of tried to long that model. As Darren mentioned in his opening question around, we're taking this wait-and-see approach through bid season, but we do feel like things did inflect. The one thing I would mention that if you really look at the growth that we experienced through the pandemic, we're there for our customers in their greatest time of need and really felt like we were strategic. And really what we saw from a behavior standpoint from several of our customers throughout 2023 is that they really acted more transactional on the back-end of that pandemic. Multiple round bids, driving down to that lowest price. And so, we do have to recalibrate how we think about how we step forward. What I can tell you is we're focused on growing, but we're focused on growing at the right rate where we can add value to our customers' networks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJason Seidel: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for taking the question. Can we focus a little bit on reported yields in terms of the outlook? It seems like there's going to be more mix changes coming with the move back to the West Coast ports. How should we look at that as it flows through the model for 2024?\nJohn Roberts: Well, certainly -- I mean, the pricing environment just has too many unknowns today really to highlight anything there, Jason. What I would say is, it's certainly the longer length of haul loads that the West Coast represents can represent higher revenue per load. But that doesn't necessarily mean that there is pricing increases there. And so I'm not going to be able to fill out sort of the mix for you. I mean, we don't even know what that mix will be just yet. Certainly, there is an opportunity for growth on the West Coast that we're hearing about as more and more customers are talking about a shift of their imports to the West Coast.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS Financial. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit about Intermodal margin in the fourth quarter. If we take out the insurance, you saw about 80 basis points of sequential improvement in Intermodal margin. And I just wanted to see if you could give a sense of what drove that? Was that less repositioning expense? Was that something helpful on the revenue side? It didn't sound like there is a change on price. And then, I guess, related to that, when you have a longer length of haul and some favorable mix, does that affect you, like price? Does that help the margin a bit? So, really just a couple of things on Intermodal margin. Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I think that certainly the fixed costs that we're carrying is material. And we highlighted that at least for the fourth-quarter, the coiled spring unlocked a little bit and we were able to spread growth volume over more loads and that's certainly was a contributing factor behind that. No, there certainly was not a price improvement during the quarter. Pricing will continue to be and forever will be the fastest way to repair margin. But certainly volume in our current state is worth more to us than it ever has been in our past given the asset count that we currently own. And so volume is worth more than it used to be and certainly in the fourth quarter was able to show that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I know you don't want to talk about rates given all the uncertainty at this point, but maybe you can talk more about just the conversations with the shippers. Some of that momentum and that surprise upside in the fourth-quarter, is that really carried into the conversations as they unfold here? Are they looking for longer durations? Are they looking for back-half locking in some capacity? Darren, would love to hear if there's actual truckload conversion that's happening. And then maybe, Brad, you can just give us a sense in terms of what you see in the truck market itself from a capacity spot rate improvement, what do you expect here standing in the first part of the year looking to the rest of it? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Okay. This is Darren. I'll start and just -- and then hand it off to Brad. I think that from a pricing conversation perspective, it's really the wide variety of results there in terms of I think there is universal acknowledgment for our service performance and we feel good about that. There is universal hesitancy to offer rate increases and competition is real. There is competition out there and that will always be a factor. Our customers are under tremendous pressure not to have their costs go up, and so that's going to be a factor as we -- but at the same time, we really -- we're not far enough into these conversations to be able to make heads or tails of it. There's a lot of work to be done. I think that I'm proud of the way that customers are responding to the quality of our service and we're going to lean in on that.\nBrad Hicks: Yes. Brian, I would just add -- this is Brad Hicks. Similar to what Darren said, it's really way too early in the bid cycle to see what's ahead of us there. But at least from our perspective, from a trucker standpoint, rates have to go up and I can't tell you exactly when that's going to happen, but the cost, the inflation, when we look at the operating cost of not just our own fleet, the fleets in general and we're rates plummeted in the Truckload space, which are down more than 2 times what they were in terms of a percent reduction than we see in Intermodal over the last 12 or 14 months, something is going to have to give there. We obviously pay real close attention on what's going on with Truckload capacity and we do start to see exits in the marketplace there. And at some point, that's going to have to inflect. We'd like that to be sooner than later. As Darren mentioned, customers are still under tremendous pressure. They are just not going to give it to you, but I do feel like something will turn at some point. It's a matter of if not when. And so that's how I would respond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nBruce Chan: Hey, thanks, operator. Brad Hicks, maybe just sticking with you here on the ICS side. I noticed that sequential gap down in the contractual business percentage, I was just wondering if that's due to maybe capturing some seasonal spot opportunity. Was that more of a function of the mix from BNSF or was that a function of the calling that you're talking about? And then maybe just thinking through profitability in the segment, do you expect the acquisition and integration cost to kind of moderate this quarter, are we still working through some of those?\nBrad Hicks: Can you repeat the very first part of your question, if you don't mind?\nBruce Chan: No, not at all. Just looking at that move down in the contractual business percentage to I think it was 59%. Is that seasonal spot opportunity? Was that BNSF mix? Or was that some of the calling that you've been doing?\nBrad Hicks: Great. Okay. Thank you. Well, first, let me correct, when I ended the last question, all I said, if not when, it's when not if. Sorry, I was getting ahead of myself there. But, we saw that come in right around 59% contract, a little bit lower than what we had been. Certainly, the mix of business that we saw come through in the over-the-road assets of the BNSF acquisition, that did play a factor. I think that as we move forward, as you look at our history, largely, we like to be in that 50/50. There is times where that swings higher on contract or published. We got overweighted during the pandemic, if you recall, on spot when we were greater than 50% spot. So, the sweet spot would be for us deliver that 50% to 60%, so I'd like to think that that's going to maintain. But we're also going to need to see the spot market -- overall demand in spot market pickup. It still is relatively soft in that category. Compliance is very high amongst shipper tenders. In terms of carriers accepting tender acceptance and so, we're going to be real close attention as we move deeper in the year. Do believe that you are likely to see -- when we do see the flip, you will start to see spot opportunities grow and we'll be poised to take advantage of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon. A quick clarification and then a question on the insurance stuff. So, Shelley, I think you talked about growing Dedicated EBIT maybe being challenging. Were you referring to like the GAAP EBIT number or the adjusted EBIT number? And then the real question I have for you is, John, I appreciate your comments on insurance being a recurring thing. But John Kuhlow, if we would look at what we did in terms of the $53 million going into reserves, however you change the premiums and the limits on the policies. If 2023 happened exactly as it happened this year in terms of incidents and payouts, flash forward to 2024, if that just repeats, in 2024, are we taking another charge or are we not taking another charge? Thanks.\nJohn Kuhlow: So, when you're talking about the GAAP, could you repeat that first question again for Dedicated EBIT?\nDavid Vernon: The first question on Dedicated was, I think Shelley mentioned that it's going to be challenging to grow Dedicated from an EBIT perspective in this market. And was she referring to the GAAP number or the non-GAAP number?\nBrad Delco: Yes. I think David, I don't want to answer that. This is Brad Delco. I don't want to answer that question, because it sounds like if we answer that, it provides a little bit too much on guidance. I think, Nick's intended purpose there and Shelley's intended purpose there was, we have visibility in some fleet losses. And as a result, it's going to be hard to grow revenue and operating income in the quarter. Don't necessarily want to try to distinguish between whether that's on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, because we report and we speak to everything in our financials on a GAAP basis.\nJohn Kuhlow: And David, just to add a final point on insurance. If 2023 were -- or if 2024 plays out like 2023, as I mentioned, we look at our reserves quarterly. We feel like the reserves are appropriately valued. These values were placed on prior-period claims. So, it is not our expectation that we have these charges going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have no further questions in our queue at this time. I will now turn the conference over to John Roberts -- sorry. John Roberts, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.\nJohn Roberts: Great. Thank you and I appreciate the interest in the call today. I would reiterate goodbye and good riddance to 2023, with a couple of exceptions. We think about the performance in our Dedicated and Final Mile business, again, revealing what we believe is a very complementary portfolio of services built in very intentionally. I'd look at our performance and safety. We feel like there is a disconnect between our actual work in performance and investment and the results we're getting in the claims markets and the insurance markets. I think, I look at like JBI, Intermodal has kind of been in the gym all year and we're carrying some extra positioning, but we got a glimpse of that, even in the fourth quarter of what that can lead us to. And I don't remember who said it, but I'm a '80s rock fan and I heard Back In Black, and I really like that, because that'll be something I can use around here through the rest of our work. I wouldn't say that, while 2023 was a tough year, and in fact, we talk about our tenure a lot, but we've discussed here, none of us have really seen much in the lag over 2023 in many years. We're looking at decades of leadership here and so I think, while it was one of the toughest, I see it as also a very strengthening year. We had to lean-in harder to get ready for 2024. We had to ask ourselves a different type of question than we normally do and through that work in prepping for 2024 and dealing with 2023, I do believe we're better prepared as we come out of -- and I guess I'll say when not if, but when we come out of this freight recession, I totally and completely believe we are ready to respond to the needs of our customers. We are -- have extraordinarily strong alignment and commitment to our top priorities, our people, our technology, and our capacity and I would just say let's watch for improvements while we continue to take care of our people who take care of our customers. And when that presents, I think we'll be very ready to serve and take advantage of that change in climate, so good riddance. Thanks for the memories and I'll turn it over to Shelley, to wrap us up.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John. And there is a saying that John Roberts has said for many years around here and it is, growth is oxygen. And I think that you saw some of that come into play in the fourth quarter in Intermodal and that's exactly why we are built for scale. We do look at our investments for the long term and we know that our customers want more of our services and want us to be more comprehensive and solve our new supply chain challenges over the long term. And so we have spent 2023 getting prepared and ready for our customers. Now, in 2024, we need to grow into our investments, in our people, and our technology, and our capacity. One of the ways that we will do that and why it's our priority number one, is making sure that we continue our operational excellence to further separate ourselves as the best-in-class in all five of our business units. That will allow us to create more value for our customers. They will recognize that value. And then, we believe we can earn the right to have a conversation with our customers around cost. That is a key focus for us and that started on January 1. Finally, that will allow us to continue focusing on driving long-term compelling returns for our shareholders. So, those three key priorities as we march into 2024 lets us have a happy dance that 2023 is over and we're moving into 2024, because we're built for scale, and we're ready for growth. But I would be remiss if I did not say we are remaining committed to people being our top priority. Our team of 35,000 people have worked so hard this year, they have been resilient, they have labored harder this year than likely any other year, at least in my 29-year career, and sometimes the fruit of their labor doesn't necessarily show it on paper, but we do believe over the long-term, that fruit of their labor will prove it for our customers, for our people, and for our shareholders. With that, I thank you for your time and your interest. Cheers to 2024.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments, as well as provide an update on J.B Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains very competitive from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by a 12% decline in volume and a 15% decline in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. The acquisition contributed a little over $90 million of revenue to our performance in the quarter. Similar to prior quarters, overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market, remains depressed versus the same period last year. While we aren't pleased with the current results in ICS, we are taking steps that will position us for better success in the future. We have focused our efforts on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio and calling some unprofitable freight which contributed to the lower volume in the quarter. We believe we are out in front of the market with some of our work on rates, but it is too early in the bid season process to fully gauge our performance. We are investing in areas to mitigate strategic theft and enhance capabilities in our platform, while rightsizing resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall, we do believe these changes will position us for better long-term growth and success. Looking at 2024, in ICS, we are focused on quality volume growth that recognizes the value and quality service we provide in the market and rightsizing our cost structure further, to align with activity levels, either through scaling or attrition. We're also focused on premier execution across the business through reliable, excellent service, high on-time performance, and further strategic theft mitigation. Moving over to JBT or Truckload, segment gross revenue was down 19% year-over-year, driven by a 13% decline in revenue per load, and a 7% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering is outperforming the market, as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. The flexibility that we can provide customers by combining dropped trailer capacity with the ability to source the carrier to move the load on the J.B Hunt 360 platform is key and resonates well with our customers. Going into 2024, we are focused on improving the efficiency of our network through increased trailer turns, essentially creating additional capacity on our network without having to add a significant amount of assets. We are also focused on maintaining balance across the trailer network to ensure our assets are in the correct place to meet customer demand and continuing to grow while making sure the overall revenue quality of our portfolio remains healthy. I'll close with some comments on 360. Our investments in our company foundations, our people, technology and capacity remain a focus for us. Technology-enables our people, helps drive productivity and also drives efficiency and how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Despite the challenging freight environment and depressed demand, we continue to see improved productivity in our people-driven by 360 platform. It is just matched to some degree by the current market conditions. That said, as our cost structure is becoming more aligned with current demand, we continue to believe our technology will drive productivity and efficiency gains as the market recovers, allowing us to meet higher customer demand levels without having to had as many resources, while providing high levels of service for our customers. We know that investing in our people, technology and capacity is key to our success and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Hey, Bascome, this is Brad. I'll give a shot at this. First, I mean, you guys treat insurance how you want. I think the intent of sharing the $50 million change in net loss on sale of equipment was more of a year-over-year comment versus sequential, and I don't have that in front of me to share. In terms of what you should expect from 4Q to 1Q, while there's still a lot of 1Q left, we don't typically provide guidance. So I'm sure over the course of the quarter, you and the market will inform itself on kind of what's happening. But as you've heard from our executive team, there's a lot of things that we're working on making sure we're delivering value for customers and making sure we're focused on getting ourselves to earning the right return on our investments and that will be the focus going forward and we'll just have to compete in the market that's given to us. Yeah, Jordan, thank you. It's Brad Hicks. It's incredibly difficult brokerage environment as we will note throughout the entire year. We did spend a tremendous amount of time focused on our cost as we saw volume decline and revenue quality back up significantly. Maybe it's extremely difficult through the bid season that really pick your spots in an ever so declining rate environment. And I do feel like last quarter or quarter and a half, we've been just kind of tried to long that model. As Darren mentioned in his opening question around, we're taking this wait-and-see approach through bid season, but we do feel like things did inflect.

Multiple round bids, driving down to that lowest price. And so, we do have to recalibrate how we think about how we step forward.

Similar to what Darren said, it's really way too early in the bid cycle to see what's ahead of us there.

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and fiscal year and will include more color on the insurance expense impact on the quarter as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, outside of Intermodal and to a lesser extent Final Mile, we didn't see many signs of a peak season in the quarter. Starting with our fourth-quarter results, on a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%, operating income declined 28% and diluted earnings per share decreased 23%. The declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes in our yields combined with inflationary cost pressures. Our fourth-quarter results include a $53 million charge or $0.38 per diluted share related to higher insurance and claims expense primarily related to negative developments of claims and exceeding coverage limits in certain insurance layers. This charge is similar to a charge we incurred in the fourth quarter last year as certain claims from prior incidents continue to settle at much higher amounts than we have historically experienced. For the full-year 2023, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue declined 13%, operating income declined 25%, diluted earnings per share decreased 24%. These full-year results include the impact of the insurance charge I outlined previously. Looking to 2024, we expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in the areas of insurance premiums, capital and people costs. Part of the increase in insurance relates to increases in underlying premiums largely due to market conditions, but also to provide greater coverage across the businesses. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged below our target of one times debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA and maintain flexibility with our credit facility that has ample borrowing capacity, if needed. Looking into 2024, we are planning for net capital expenditures between $800 million and $1 billion. Going a level deeper, our 2024 capital plan assumes $250 million to $300 million for new power equipment, primarily in Intermodal and dedicated and $250 million to $300 million for new trailing equipment which includes containers, chassis and trailers. We also expect to deploy $300 million to $350 million for real-estate and other investments, including technology. In addition, our capital allocation plan in 2024 contemplates continued support of our dividend and we expect to take advantage of opportunities in the market to repurchase shares when they present themselves, all while maintaining our leverage ratio around one times EBITDA. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick. Hey. And Ken, this is John Kuhlow. I'll just add. On the insurance cost pressure that we're seeing, our general approach to risk management is to maintain coverage and insurance policies for our exposures. And as we reset the premiums going into 2024, we saw upwards of 50% to 60% increases in those premiums. And so when we talk about the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in 2024, it's mostly around our premiums. We've done a great job this year and working and focusing on safety to try to bring those incidents down. But the claims costs of the individual claims is what's driving a lot of the inflationary pressures. Yes. Well Chris, I'll take that, again. It's John Kuhlow. With respect to the insurance, we did have a charge last year in the fourth quarter. This really relates to continuing to see what we refer to as unprecedented settlements in our prior year claims. We had a situation where we ran out of our coverage limits in those periods. And so, we're effectively self-insured. Each quarter, we go through and we assess our reserves and working with our actuaries, we needed -- we determined that we need to take up our reserves. Can't say that this will never happen again, but we do believe that the charge that we took for our reserves, that makes them properly valued now. As I mentioned before, we do -- our approach is to maintain coverage for all of our businesses. And we are taking that up and we did a little bit in 2023 and taking that up in 2024 and going forward. Just to give -- with respect to the current environment and how we're seeing these settlements claimed, so -- or how we see these claims settled. So, that's really where we're seeing the most pressure. We are again continuing to look at our reserves on a quarterly basis. But I feel like most of the inflation that we're seeing is through the cost premiums that we have from our underwriters. Hi, Ravi. I'd just add, it is frustrating, but we are focused on the areas that we can control. And as Nick said, we're working to do everything we can to improve our safety to make sure that the incidents themselves are down. And then there needs to be something done with respect to the settlement charges. So, when you're talking about the GAAP, could you repeat that first question again for Dedicated EBIT? And David, just to add a final point on insurance. If 2023 were -- or if 2024 plays out like 2023, as I mentioned, we look at our reserves quarterly. We feel like the reserves are appropriately valued. These values were placed on prior-period claims. So, it is not our expectation that we have these charges going forward."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the fourth-quarter, I am pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results despite the approximately $20 million of insurance-related expense incurred in this segment. Even with the challenging freight environment in 2023, our dedicated business had a record year in both revenue and operating income. Demand for professional, outsourced, private fleet solutions has held up well and we sold approximately 300 trucks of new deals during the fourth-quarter, bringing our full-year sales number to approximately 1,150 trucks. Our pipeline remains strong, but we do have some visibility into fleet losses and/or downsizes throughout 2024 and are working hard to backfill these by executing on that pipeline. Importantly, we are remaining disciplined in pricing new opportunities to ensure we maintain our required rates of return. While 2023 was a challenging year, from a fleet growth perspective, I want to put some context around the work we have done to improve the overall strength and durability of our business. While we have experienced downsizing a lot of our fleets, we even lost the handful of accounts over the last year. The percent of portfolio that churned in 2023 was about half of what we saw in 2009 during the Great Recession. Our focus on private fleet and our customer value delivery process, CVD, that was established from our experience during that time, set us up for better performance during this downturn. As we look to 2024, our strategic focus includes continuing to scale the business, create value for customers, and to leverage our density to help offset inflationary cost pressures, all while executing on behalf of our customers in the safest manner possible. Moving to Final Mile. We have made good progress on improving the revenue quality of our portfolio, and our strong service metrics highlight the value we create for and on behalf of our customers. Our year-over-year change in profitability continues to outpace the change in revenue despite incurring $3 million in additional insurance-related expense in the quarter. Demand for big and bulky products overall remains muted, particularly in furniture, but we did see a seasonal lift in demand for exercise equipment around the holidays. Our focus in this business remains on providing the highest-quality service for the delivery of big and bulky items into the homes of our customer's customer. This service-oriented focus resonates well in the market and we are seeing new brands engaging in discussions with our team. As we move into 2024, we're focused on growing and scaling the business and building on the solid foundation that we have. We will also remain disciplined on revenue quality while focusing on operational excellence and execution for our customers and their customers in a safe, secured manner. Similar to last quarter's, I'll close with some comments on safety in our equipment. Aligning with our Company foundation of taking care of our people, but also the motoring public, we want to continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 60% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras in our fleet with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. As a Company, we had our best safety performance in our history in 2023 measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. As you have heard, the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially, so we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk where possible. Lastly, on equipment, we have cleaned out our older equipment and feel our fleet is refreshed and in good position heading into 2024. You heard John Kuhlow give you a range on CapEx, which reflects our better position on equipment age. This concludes my remarks, but I would like to now turn it over to Darren. Yes. I would say, just as I was thinking about and reflecting back on this year that I think we performed much better than we did in 2008 and 2009, and I've talked about that, just the structure of our deals, CVD, and we lost 18% of our fleet in 2009 and didn't lose 9% -- or we did lose 9%. And so, I think through that, we've got a better base of business, better diversified, so I feel we've come out of that pretty good, sets up well. I would say though that when I think about our sales, I'm just going to give you our standard line of, we're going to sell a 1000 to 1200 trucks, just like we did last year in a really tough year. We're going to plan on doing that again. And as I said, we've got some visibility to some fleet losses coming up. And so, there is a lot of moving parts in there. But when I look at the market and what we're after, the private fleet market, it's really pretty stable. We've -- some of the losses have been in our more what I would call, our business that we've had, legacy business, for quite some time. And so, I think our base will get more solid as we move forward with more private fleets. Hey, Al. First of all, I would say, on our ability to replace some -- clearly, the way our business works is, we usually have waves when we get start-up so we incur the cost. And so, with us losing some of our trucks in 2023, we don't have the momentum we normally have going into 2024, and so we replaced them quickly, but it just takes a little time to kind of get the momentum and get the revenue and the profitability up and going. So, that's the reason that we're talking about 2024 the way we are. Now, as far as any vertical, we looked through our book. I would say, on the furniture side, we had a little bit of that in dedicated. It's impacted some. But I would say that one that's probably been the strongest has been the grocery side of things have just been consistent throughout. And then the others, it's kind of -- just as the economy is going, they're kind of going. Nothing really sticks out anywhere else. Yeah, I'll jump in and this is Nick. Clearly, we think we had record safety year when we look at DOT preventables for the entire organization and we're very pleased with that. We're doing things like -- and we're placing cameras. We're about 65% complete on that rollout. We will have all of those other trucks [retro'ed] (ph) by the end of Q3. So, we clearly think that will help us with our accidents. And then if you think we're also -- we got 65% of our fleet that's got Side Guard Assist that helps us on the right side. Those we can't retro, this is going to take us another couple of years. So we think we're out leading well on the safety side, but the fact is that the individual claims are just going through the roof and the cost of those. And quite honestly, those are in state courts. And so it's a state-by-state that's got to be addressed. We're working with the American Trucking Association and trying to go state-by-state to get tort reform. So, it's going to be a long battle there unless there is some federal legislation that would kind of help us interstate truckers out there. So, John, I don't know if you want to --"

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. As we've navigated through 2023, we remain committed to our strategic areas of focus, including investing in our people, technology and capacity. Our people have and always will come first and I'm proud of the commitment to our people, while continuing to invest in capacity for our network as we prepare to grow with our customers to meet their demand over the years ahead. The experience and talents of our people and our capacity to deliver are connected and enhanced by our technology investments, which combined together, would allow us to deliver exceptional value for our customers. As we have discussed the past couple of quarters and as John discussed, we remain in a challenging environment, but we continue to see some signs of improvement, especially related to intermodal volumes. Having said that, I think it's important to reiterate the volume is historically a leading indicator while price is typically a lagging indicator with uncertainty around the timing of any potential inflection. Going forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for and grow with our customers over the long-term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As we look to 2024 and the uncertain market dynamics, our focus as an organization has not changed. We continue to manage our business to put us in the best position for long-term growth. While we are long-term focused, we are not satisfied with the current results in our business, especially the return performance across our business segments. Intermodal is seeing positive volume growth, but the impact of pricing during the last bid season will be with us through at least the first half of this year. Dedicated margins were resilient in 2023, but the impact of truck count losses and lack of fleet growth will make top and bottom line growth more challenging this year. Final Mile is holding up well despite tepid demand in our end markets. Our Brokerage and Power Only businesses are under significant pressure on both volume and price and continue to feel the brunt of the freight market as evidenced by the performance. We are focused on controlling what we can control and remaining flexible to deliver the best value for our customers. This is where our go-to-market strategy and mode in different service offering can help customers lower cost. We can save customers' money by converting over-the-road shipments to Intermodal, which is cheaper and less carbon intensive. We can create the most efficient dedicated fleets or leverage our technology through our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source the most efficient capacity to drive value and differentiate the end experience for our customers' customer in our Final Mile network. In closing, I want to highlight our areas of strategic focus for 2024. First, we are focused on operational excellence to deliver exceptional value to our customers. While service levels are strong, we believe consistent and quality service will further differentiate us from peers and support our ability to win market share at acceptable returns. Second, we will continue to scale our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity. This isn't something new for us and our commitment to investment in these three areas further position us for long-term growth with our customers as the market recovers. And third, we want to remain focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. We operate in a cyclical market with ups and downs, but over the long-term, we believe our mode in different approach offers customers the most options to deliver the greatest value and solve for their needs, ultimately supporting our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Thank you, John. And there is a saying that John Roberts has said for many years around here and it is, growth is oxygen. And I think that you saw some of that come into play in the fourth quarter in Intermodal and that's exactly why we are built for scale. We do look at our investments for the long term and we know that our customers want more of our services and want us to be more comprehensive and solve our new supply chain challenges over the long term. And so we have spent 2023 getting prepared and ready for our customers. Now, in 2024, we need to grow into our investments, in our people, and our technology, and our capacity. One of the ways that we will do that and why it's our priority number one, is making sure that we continue our operational excellence to further separate ourselves as the best-in-class in all five of our business units. That will allow us to create more value for our customers. They will recognize that value. And then, we believe we can earn the right to have a conversation with our customers around cost. That is a key focus for us and that started on January 1. Finally, that will allow us to continue focusing on driving long-term compelling returns for our shareholders. So, those three key priorities as we march into 2024 lets us have a happy dance that 2023 is over and we're moving into 2024, because we're built for scale, and we're ready for growth. But I would be remiss if I did not say we are remaining committed to people being our top priority. Our team of 35,000 people have worked so hard this year, they have been resilient, they have labored harder this year than likely any other year, at least in my 29-year career, and sometimes the fruit of their labor doesn't necessarily show it on paper, but we do believe over the long-term, that fruit of their labor will prove it for our customers, for our people, and for our shareholders. With that, I thank you for your time and your interest. Cheers to 2024."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have, to deliver value for our customers and all our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. As you heard, we remain in a challenging freight environment, but we have been seeing improving trends in Intermodal since this Spring, which continued as evidenced by our 6% increase in volume for the quarter. In fact, we have seen an improvement in our year-over-year monthly volume trends since April or for nine consecutive months. By month in the fourth quarter, our volumes were up 6% in October, 6% in November, and up 8% in December. During the quarter, we saw a peak season in Intermodal that neither we, or our customers, nor our rail providers were expecting, yet we were able to solve for our customers' capacity needs while maintaining high service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. While we are encouraged by the volume trends we are seeing, it is worth reiterating that volume is historically a leading indicator, while price is typically a lagging indicator. We continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share from the highway. During the quarter, we saw margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the impact of bids priced in prior periods and also, our results in the fourth quarter included approximately $16 million of higher insurance-related expense. We are currently in the early innings of bid season for 2024 and believe it is too early to comment on our expectations or the success of bid so far. Given our strong service levels and the unique value our Intermodal network can provide, we are working with customers to ensure this value is realized and that we earn an acceptable return on our investments to meet and serve their capacity needs. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the Intermodal offering, and growing the overall market. We remain encouraged by the work we are doing with BNSF in the West and the collaboration between our companies. We announced our new Quantum offering during the quarter. We are very excited about this service and the potential to expand the Intermodal market by working with customers that have service-sensitive freight. During the quarter, we also announced our new Intermodal service out of Mexico with GMXT through the Eagle Pass gateway connecting with BNSF. This gives our customers more options to solve their cross-border capacity needs, leveraging the networks of both GMXT and BNSF. In closing, our focus for 2024 will be on regaining share from the over-the-road market, scaling our business to better leverage our assets and investments, and delivering excellent operational execution for and on behalf of our customers. We strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and improved ways to better serve their transportation needs. We have the people, technology, and capacity in the network to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today and remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient, cost-competitive, and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. So, Brandon, I'll start. This is Darren. Certainly, I'm not going to guide you into 2024. What I will say is pricing will forever be worth more than volume in terms of margin performance and return performance. We are under immense cost pressure. And certainly, we believe the value proposition we represent to our customers should equate to a return position that justifies our investments. There's a lot yet to be determined and -- as we go through the bid cycle and so the answer to your question is we'll play itself out in 2024 and we're all going to have to wait and see what the environment is like. Sure. Well, I don't know that -- when I highlight cost pressures, I wasn't intending to just highlight taking containers in and out of storage. I mean, just inflationary cost pressures from wages for our drivers are higher, rates with our railroads are higher. Certainly, just all employment costs, maintenance the equipment itself cost more. Just across-the-board, we have cost increases and that inflationary cost lives across our enterprise, not just Intermodal certainly. And so those are challenges that we're all faced with. It's certainly the same thing that our customers are faced with. And that's why we're working with our customers to deliver more value and look for how do we partner together and take cost out of each other system as we move forward. And in terms of when, you get to see that, just like the last question. We're just going to have to wait and see until we can get the volume growing on a steady base and get the pricing cycle behind us. We don't know exactly what to expect in that. We know that the service quality we built in 2023 has earned us the right to really dialog with our customers around these cost challenges we're faced with. Yes. Okay. I appreciate the question. I think that certainly the new services, we're excited about. I don't want to -- the Mexico service announcement was a conversion from business we were handling through a different method, so I don't want that to be portrayed as an immediate growth movement. But as we move forward, it solidifies our capacity plans for Mexico to allow us to grow further in the long-term, over the long-term future. And when I think about December, the comp was certainly easier. I think that is a factor. I also believe that our mix of customers and the particular group of shippers we serve, had a more significant peak season that they even predicted and that's really why we've highlighted that the peak season was a surprise. And I'll even go as far as to say, our capacity, what I call the coiled spring for many quarters, solved for us this fourth quarter and that peak season, it really allowed us to execute for our customers at a very high level and we're really, really proud of that. I'm extremely proud of my team and I want to make sure and say that. That was impressive, Amit. I think that, look, as volumes came at us in the fourth quarter and like we've highlighted many times, our customers were even surprised by that. So, I think that the volume momentum that built during that quarter was largely related to activities that those customers had going on in the fourth quarter. And again, because they were surprised by it, I think that's why we feel a little bit more unclear right now about what the early part of this year holds. Certainly, traditionally, the first quarter is a drop-down from the fourth quarter. I would say that for my entire career, that's been the case and so I don't know that I am going to guide you on what will happen, but certainly, our customers' inability to tell us about the peak season continues to be a challenge for us to get good solid information about what to expect. Okay. This is Darren. I'll start and just -- and then hand it off to Brad. I think that from a pricing conversation perspective, it's really the wide variety of results there in terms of I think there is universal acknowledgment for our service performance and we feel good about that. There is universal hesitancy to offer rate increases and competition is real. There is competition out there and that will always be a factor. Our customers are under tremendous pressure not to have their costs go up, and so that's going to be a factor as we -- but at the same time, we really -- we're not far enough into these conversations to be able to make heads or tails of it. There's a lot of work to be done. I think that I'm proud of the way that customers are responding to the quality of our service and we're going to lean in on that."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to hit on a couple of topics before I turn it over to our team to discuss our results and how we are investing and managing the business. We remain long-term focused and we'll continue to do so while being disciplined in our approach. I'm a believer in taking the bad with the good and the good with the bad, so let's start with the bad, as well as the obvious. On the topic of Insurance, we have been routinely covering with you the inflationary cost headwinds we faced as a Company, as well as an industry in the areas of professional driver and non-driver wages, healthcare benefits, and equipment cost. However, as an industry, we are also seeing unprecedented pressure in the area of claims, cost, or settlements. As you saw in our release, we incurred $53 million of additional costs in the quarter, largely related to higher claims cost and exceeding coverage limits in certain insurance layers. And this, despite 2023 being the Company's best performance in history on safety, measured by having our lowest DOT preventable accidents per million miles. We remain one of the safest carriers in the industry. Yet our insurance rates continued to increase as the industry experiences higher virdicts, and as a result, higher litigation settlements. During verdicts in trucking cases where the verdicts exceed $1 million, have seen an 867% increase in the average size of verdicts from 2010 to 2018. This is according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform. Given that the majority of motor carriers in the industry carry only $1 million in coverage, just above the legal minimum of $750,000 in coverage, it's the larger carriers who bear the brunt or disproportionate share of the escalating insurance and claims cost and ultimately these inflationary costs get passed on to customers and consumers. As you've heard from us repeatedly, we are continuously focused on our safety performance and you've heard updates from Nick on our latest investments in this area. Our intense focus on safety and our investments in the latest safety technology and compliant equipment helps to protect our drivers, the motoring public, the environment, our customers, and your investments. We remain steadfast and committed to the safety of our people and the motoring public and will continue to invest in the latest technologies and training to support these efforts. On the freight environment, we have turned the page on 2023, goodbye and good riddance. As you are aware, 2023 presented many challenges, but I am very proud of our team and their perseverance in how they responded to these challenges. The experience of our leaders and the investments made during this downturn, I am confident, will drive long-term value for the Company. While the New Year has begun and the calendar has flipped to another page, not much has changed in regard to the freight environment. While we see opportunities across all of our businesses, good work is needed in the areas of revenue quality, controlling cost, and execution to earn an appropriate return while delivering value to our customers. We remain committed to our focus on return on invested capital and managing for the long-term, but the freight environment remains in a challenged state. With all of that out of the way, I am truly encouraged by our team's collective efforts and the opportunities presented across all of our businesses and for our relative performance in this market for 2023. Intermodal is seeing some momentum on the volume side the last few quarters and our work with BNSF and our other rail providers presents opportunities for growth in our future. Dedicated continues to be a steady performer, and along with Final Mile both had record years in segment operating income performance. And while ICS and JBT has faced the brunt of the market challenges, we still see great opportunity to scale our investments in technology, to drive efficiency in our customer supply chain in both our brokerage and power only offerings. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley? Okay. Well, thanks for the two questions, Scott. So, when it comes to volume and looking to regain share from the highway, certainly that feels like some of the lowest fruit for us given the loss of share over, I'm going to call it, several years back into PSR time window, even through certainly the pandemic, I think Intermodal lost some share due to weakness in velocity. And as we gain velocity in 2023, we feel like we can better compete for our customers on consistency in the transit model that the customers need. So that's why we largely highlight highway conversions. Certainly, growth of import traffics through the West Coast ports is an absolute benefit to J.B. Hunt. Certainly, I think we highlighted in the earnings release that we grew Transcon 13% in the fourth-quarter. So that I would think highlights at least some advantage of that effort from growth of imports. As it relates to decoupling highway pricing to Intermodal pricing, I think that between our Transcon networks and our Eastern networks, there is already some decoupling, not 100%. Certainly the influence of the Intermodal market out West is a bigger factor in pricing there than highway rates. But in the eastern network, I can't imagine a world where Intermodal pricing would ever decouple from highway pricing in the eastern network. They really will be tied together. Well, certainly -- I mean, the pricing environment just has too many unknowns today really to highlight anything there, Jason. What I would say is, it's certainly the longer length of haul loads that the West Coast represents can represent higher revenue per load. But that doesn't necessarily mean that there is pricing increases there. And so I'm not going to be able to fill out sort of the mix for you. I mean, we don't even know what that mix will be just yet. Certainly, there is an opportunity for growth on the West Coast that we're hearing about as more and more customers are talking about a shift of their imports to the West Coast. Well, I think that certainly the fixed costs that we're carrying is material. And we highlighted that at least for the fourth-quarter, the coiled spring unlocked a little bit and we were able to spread growth volume over more loads and that's certainly was a contributing factor behind that. No, there certainly was not a price improvement during the quarter. Pricing will continue to be and forever will be the fastest way to repair margin. But certainly volume in our current state is worth more to us than it ever has been in our past given the asset count that we currently own. And so volume is worth more than it used to be and certainly in the fourth quarter was able to show that. Great. Thank you and I appreciate the interest in the call today. I would reiterate goodbye and good riddance to 2023, with a couple of exceptions. We think about the performance in our Dedicated and Final Mile business, again, revealing what we believe is a very complementary portfolio of services built in very intentionally. I'd look at our performance and safety. We feel like there is a disconnect between our actual work in performance and investment and the results we're getting in the claims markets and the insurance markets. I think, I look at like JBI, Intermodal has kind of been in the gym all year and we're carrying some extra positioning, but we got a glimpse of that, even in the fourth quarter of what that can lead us to. And I don't remember who said it, but I'm a '80s rock fan and I heard Back In Black, and I really like that, because that'll be something I can use around here through the rest of our work. I wouldn't say that, while 2023 was a tough year, and in fact, we talk about our tenure a lot, but we've discussed here, none of us have really seen much in the lag over 2023 in many years. We're looking at decades of leadership here and so I think, while it was one of the toughest, I see it as also a very strengthening year. We had to lean-in harder to get ready for 2024. We had to ask ourselves a different type of question than we normally do and through that work in prepping for 2024 and dealing with 2023, I do believe we're better prepared as we come out of -- and I guess I'll say when not if, but when we come out of this freight recession, I totally and completely believe we are ready to respond to the needs of our customers. We are -- have extraordinarily strong alignment and commitment to our top priorities, our people, our technology, and our capacity and I would just say let's watch for improvements while we continue to take care of our people who take care of our customers. And when that presents, I think we'll be very ready to serve and take advantage of that change in climate, so good riddance. Thanks for the memories and I'll turn it over to Shelley, to wrap us up."

I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to take a minute to highlight and reinforce some of the key tenets around how we manage the company. While the challenges in the freight cycle are well known and documented, and as a result, there is no need to rehash here,. I will again remind you about our long-term approach to the business. Our focus is on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see long-term opportunity to compound returns. We participate in an industry with a large, addressable market that is cyclical. Remaining disciplined around our investments with a long-term focus on our people, technology that enables and capacity to deliver for and on behalf of our customers will support and drive long-term growth for the company and our shareholders. In March of 2022, we announced a joint initiative with BNSF to substantially improve intermodal capacity and service for our customers. We recently announced and closed the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. These are key examples of how our companies are working together to best align efficient and value added solutions for our customers. While the brokerage market is challenged, we see lots of opportunities to drive efficiency in the supply chain with our people, powered and enabled by our technology, our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. We continue to work closely with BNSF and all of our rail service providers to strengthen and create a more reliable intermodal product. And I am pleased to see the progress in our intermodal segment relative to the market in our results. Dedicated and final mile continue to show resiliency in this environment, proving again that our premium service products can be differentiated from the competition. Our J.B. Hunt 360 box product in our truckload segment continues to experience growth, providing an asset light solution, while also leveraging our investments in technology to efficiently serve customers. In closing, we have a tremendous team here at J.B. Hunt with a lot of experience. We will remain disciplined on costs and investments to best prepare the company to serve the growing needs of our customers. We will remain focused on earning appropriate returns on capital and driving efficiency in the supply chain to drive greater value for our customers. I remain confident in the future growth of the company. Now, I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My comments will cover our areas of strategic focus and how we are setting ourselves up for long-term success. Of course, these comments will align with our priorities for 2023, which, as a reminder, are to, first, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; second, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and third, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As you've heard us say since the fourth quarter call earlier this year, we have been in a challenging freight environment or a freight recession, largely driven by excess inventory in the supply chain. Our customers have been working through excess inventory, and as we stated last quarter, we felt like that de-stocking trend started to moderate in June. As we sit here today, we see further evidence of this trend, and most notably in our intermodal business, which is at the forefront of the North American supply chain. To be clear on the overall environment, we are not at a point yet to say we're out of the freight recession, but we do feel like we're coming out of it or said differently, directionally we are seeing signs of things moving in a positive direction. Going forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for, and grow with our customers over the long term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As you've heard us say before, we have a long-term approach to how we manage our business and how we invest across our company foundations, which are our people, technology, and capacity. Our people have always come first, and we remain committed to our investments in our people, in proper training, in their safety, and in fair and equitable compensation and benefits. Throughout our company, we have the experience and talent to execute in all types of environments. As an example, the officers of our company have a collective 350 years of experience, not just in the industry, but at our company. The experience and talents of our people combined with our capacity to deliver and connected and enhanced by our technology investments are what combine to deliver exceptional value for our customers. I believe we're seeing evidence of the strength of our brand and service by staying committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity. As we progress in the recovery, I'm confident in our ability to meet the growing needs of our customers as a result. In closing, while the environment is still challenging, it is important to keep in mind that pricing is a lagging indicator, while volume is typically a leading indicator. We are encouraged by the performance of our intermodal business that is gaining share in the market and the resiliency of our dedicated business, they continue to deliver efficient solutions for customers. Our final mile business is holding up well despite seeing varying degrees of demand from the end markets which they serve, highlighting the quality of our premium service product. And in our ICS and JBT business, we continue to see both segments feel the brunt of the freight cycle, most notably in price and volume. They continue to believe in our ability to scale this business to drive efficient solutions with our brokerage and drop trailer services. We will continue to manage the business for long-term growth, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term, sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll be brief with my comments, but I want to hit on a few items, including a high-level review of the quarter and an update on our capital plan. So starting with third quarter results, overall freight activity remained under pressure during the quarter as compared to last year. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 18% year-over-year. Operating income declined 33% and diluted earnings per share decreased 30%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes and yields combined with inflationary cost pressures primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs, and insurance and claims expense. We did have a discrete tax item in the quarter which lowered our effective tax rate to 18.2%. The overall impact to our earnings in the quarter was $0.16 per share spread across the tax and interest expense line items. We continue to make investments in our business for the long term across our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. From an invested capital standpoint these investments are in real estate, equipment, both trailing and power, and as previously mentioned, we did close on the purchase of the brokerage assets from BNSF Logistics in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments. We are conservatively leveraged at still below our target of one-times debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn and available as needed. I previously guided to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of net capital spent for the year. Excluding the acquisition, we anticipate falling around $1.6 billion for the year. Similar to last quarter, some of this is timing related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense with our spend. In terms of our capital priorities, no change on this front. First and foremost, we will continue to invest to grow our business. We will maintain an investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. And finally, we will use excess cash to repurchase stock. In the third quarter we repurchased approximately 267,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our dedicated and final mile segments and we'll give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. I remain pleased with the performance of our dedicated business in the quarter and the resiliency of our model. Demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well in the environment, and we continue to see many opportunities in our pipeline. In the quarter, we sold approximately 265 trucks in new deals, which brings us to over 830 year to day. We are feeling more confident in hitting our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year. Based on the timing of some deals that push from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although we have seen some slightly higher customer churn than we previously expected. In the instances where we have lost an account, we believe the business was lost at inadequate rates of return, particularly considering the value proposition we bring to our clients. Going forward, we remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver value in the market that will allow us to compound our growth over many, many years and further penetrate our large addressable market. Now on to final mile. I am pleased with our performance in the quarter and how we have positioned ourselves as a premium service provider in the industry. I believe we have been able to prove our value propositions as we are nearing the end of some of our work to improve the revenue quality of our portfolio of business. This is evidenced by the year-over-year improvement in profitability in the segment despite lower revenue. In terms of the end markets we serve, we are seeing a slight uptick in demand across some of our end markets in the segment, although furniture deliveries remain in a tough spot. We continue to focus on providing a superior service experience, delivering big and bulky items into the homes of our customer's customer. This continues to resonate well in the market and as a result we see new brands engaging in discussions and being added to our sales pipeline. Similar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety in our equipment. We continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies that will improve and enhance our safety performance as an organization. This very much aligns with our company foundations taking care of our people, but also the motoring public. We continue to roll out inward facing cameras in our fleet and remain on track to be 60% complete of our fleet by the end of the year. We are encouraged by the data we have seen so far since this initiative has gotten underway and also encouraged by the impact this should have on our cost to serve our customers. As the industry is well aware, the cost of claims continue to just move higher and higher, and we are feverishly working to mitigate the risk. Finally, a quick update on equipment. I previously stated that we would be complete with cleaning our older equipment by the end of the third quarter. We've had a couple hundred units spill into the fourth quarter, but I would say we are in a very good position with our equipment across all businesses. I would say we are finally caught up with some of the backlogs that were created as a result of the pandemic and our rapid growth over the last few years. This concludes my remarks, so I would like to now turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'll review the performance of the intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and long-term growth for all of our stakeholders. I'll start by reviewing intermodal's performance in the quarter. As I said last quarter, and you heard Shelley say earlier, we believe the inventory destocking trend started to moderate in June. And we saw evidence of that trend continue throughout the quarter as our volumes inflected positive for the first time in three quarters. By month, our volumes were down 1% in July, up 1% in August, and up 4% in September. In September, we had our largest intermodal volume week in our history and we're able to meet the strong demand with exceptional service. I'm encouraged by the fact that we are seeing the volume lift across both our transcontinental and eastern network highlighting overall increased customer demand for our intermodal service. We believe this is driven by the overall market, but also we believe we are taking market share with our strong service that is outperforming the competition. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the full implementation of the recently repriced bids, which is a reminder trended toward the lower end of our pricing expectations as bid season progressed. We continue to carry resources and capacity and the related costs to ensure that the quality of our service holds up as customer demand for a differentiated service product grows. With regard to rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the intermodal offering and growing the overall market. In fact, I'd say that our rail providers are dialed in both in the East and the West. We believe that the railroads realize that the true test of their service will come once freight volumes increase with overall demand on their networks. But we and they are confident in their ability to maintain high service levels throughout the recovery. We are very encouraged by the current work we are doing with BNSF in the West and feel even more confident about our differentiated service. We now have J.B. Hunt employees in their headquarters in Fort Worth working side by side together to create and customize solutions for our customers and solving to eliminate service challenges as they arise. We continue to work collaboratively to solve for and on behalf of our customers a clear differentiation in the market. We believe Intermodal presents a strong value proposition to customers with significantly improved rail service at a discount to truck pricing, all while cutting carbon emissions on a load by 60% compared to the truck alternative. As such, we see an enormous amount of freight that we believe should be converted from truck to intermodal. We continue to work closely with the rail providers and are encouraged to see the strong service which contributes to a better overall experience for customers. In closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our intermodal franchise and the opportunities to drive significant growth over many, many years. Our customers trust us, believe in our product, and want more of it. We have the people, the technology to enable, and the capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today, and are excited to work with customers to meet their growing demand for efficient transportation solutions. That wraps up my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our integrated capacity solutions and truckload segments. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Before I begin, I would like to publicly welcome the new employees we recently onboarded, as well as the agents from our acquisition of the brokerage operations of BNSF Logistics. We are excited about the opportunities this creates to leverage our investments in technology and the breadth of services we provide to better serve our customers. Starting with ICS, overall, the brokerage environment remains challenged and competitive. Segment gross revenue was down 48% year-over-year, driven by a 38% decline in volume and a 17% decline in revenue per load. Overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market, remains muted versus the prior year period. During the quarter, we did elect to focus our efforts on revenue quality and leading the market to push rates on certain lanes and accounts to appropriate levels. As a result, we did cull a decent amount of revenue and freight from our portfolio. As the quarter progressed, though, we did see a sequential improvement in gross profit dollars per load, particularly in our spot business, but also in our contractual business. We continue to invest in areas to mitigate strategic theft, enhance capability in our platform, and right-side resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall we believe some of these changes will position us for better success in the future. Wrapping up on ICS and to level set a little on expectations in the near term, we are seeing some margin pressure related to peak season so far in Q4, in addition to expecting some dilution from the recent acquisition in the fourth quarter. Shifting now over to JBT or truck load, segment gross revenue was down 17% year-over-year, driven by a 22% decline in revenue per load and partially offset by a 6% increase in volumes. Overall demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up double digits versus the prior year. Customers continue to see value in the flexibility and efficiency of combining the drop trailer capacity with the ability to source the right carrier on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform to move the trailer. The right carrier on the right load and at the right price, that's the power of the platform. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in the development of our 360 box offering to strengthen this product and drive greater efficiency for our customers. Overall, we believe there's growing demand in the market for this service offering and we see long-term opportunities in this area. Wrapping up on 360, as you have heard throughout our comments, we remain committed to investments in our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. I think it's appropriate to point out that technology as a foundation between our people and capacity is the link that connects them. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity, and creates efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. That capacity comes in the form of our own assets or the assets we can secure for or on behalf of our customers. J.B. Hunt 360 is our platform that empowers and enables our people and helps us access the right capacity to serve our customers efficiently with a valuable service. Our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments. This concludes my comments, so I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thank you, Brad. And just for the audience, given the number of folks in queue, we're going to limit the question to one question with no follow-up. Krista, you can go ahead and start the Q&A.\nOperator: Your first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe really wanted to start on the margins, particularly intermodal and maybe get a sense of how you guys are thinking about that and really maybe more specifically from 2Q to 3Q, it seemed like the cost per load went up decently. And I guess I'm trying to make sure I understand if that's mixed or if it's just sort of the full brunt of labor costs, labor inflation. And how do we think that that kind of trends going forward because we did see a step up in load sequentially. Curious if we see that continue, if it'll start to drive some operating leverage in that part of the business.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I'll start, Chris, just with -- we're not satisfied with our margin. We did have cost pressures in the quarter, certainly fuel is a component of that. And the way I would describe the ability to launch some growth, our growth doesn't always come neatly packaged. We moved a lot of empties to onboard new business. Our coiled spring is what enabled us to onboard new business quickly. We're very confident in the product we're offering. We're confident in the service we're offering. And as the next bit cycle comes around, we're willing to talk to our customers about our cost challenges. Do we think volume can unlock efficiency? Absolutely. But as you're ramping up rapidly there will be some cost elements that creep in there that we're going to have to battle. And secondly, we more fully implemented the pricing cycle and as expected our price was down in the quarter and that was part of the margin headwind.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good evening. Just sort of in line with Chris's question, there's the positive, you're seeing more positive trends. There's certainly a market share grab from truckload potentially that's out there. How do you think of releasing that excess capacity into the market at this point, just given your share gain and the opportunity out there? How should we think of that as we kind of move through the progression of the more positive trends here?\nJohn Roberts: Well, I don't -- Allison, I don't know how to give you a firm guidance on how quickly it'll come on board. We're engaged with our customers every day looking for ways to save them money. And one of the primary ways we do that is convert highway business to intermodal. We're looking to create better balance where we can with onboarding new business that supports our network and those will be our focus areas in terms of how quickly it comes on. I guess that gets determined by how quick our customers grow and how the overall market reflects on us. I'm confident in the service product we're offering. That's what we can control right now and so that's what we're focused on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. I know it's hard to put all the moving pieces together, but I'm sort of just curious. The third quarter margin in intermodal, I mean, do you think this could represent the bottom of the cycle if volumes continue to inflect positives and box turns move up sequentially, which occurred in the third quarter? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I think when you phrase it like that, it really all depends on what happens with our customer's volume. But if everything were to remain equal and we can onboard more volume and there's no violent recession we're faced with, then yeah, it can be the bottom. But there's so many external factors that are going to influence that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good afternoon. It's Ken Hoexter. Just on intermodal again, I guess your thoughts on the trend up 4% at the end of the quarter, was that due to the Canadian port strike? Is that maybe talk about if that trend is continuing in October? And then just if you're focused on long term and keep buying the assets, I just want to understand that CapEx comment, because it sounded like you're slowing down. But if you have all these 15% of assets stored do you lengthen the downturn by continuing to buy and store? Does that make it a longer time turnaround?\nBrad Delco: Hey, Ken, this is Brad Delco. I'm going to try to see if we can answer all five or six of those questions with each of the executives. So I\u2019ll let Darren address the intermodal one and let John Kuhlow address the CapEx question. And if we missed one, sue me in email, because I know we already cut you off.\nDarren Field: Well, as the quarter went on one thing that intermodal volumes, one of the more positive elements is, we were really growing throughout the network. Certainly imported goods that transload somewhere on the West Coast are a part of that, but we were pleased with growth we were able to see inside our Eastern network as well. So it was really evenly spread. I mean, you might have heard in the prepared comments, we set a single week volume record during the month of September, and that felt really good for our team to see the value of our services and how our customers trust us and are giving us more of their networks.\nJohn Kuhlow: And Ken, just from a CapEx standpoint, broadly speaking, we've been talking about how we had to retain a lot of equipment in 2021 and 2022 just because of the inability to get that. I think that we've made a lot of great progress on working through our replacements in 2023. We'll still have some in 2024. As you know, all of our growth CapEx is principally success-based through dedicated and even with intermodal. We are carrying, as we've talked about, excess container equipment right now, but we'll work through that and then we'll purchase new as our growth plans deem necessary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So Darren, as we enter 2024 bid season, do you think there's further downside risk to intermodal rates into the first half of the year? Is the next wave of contracts will start to reset or is there a shot that intermodal pricing can start to get better? And then just separately, just quickly, the dedicated retention went from 98% to 94%. Is that a one-off sort of blip or is that sort of a new potential trend?\nDarren Field: Well, I'll start on the intermodal pricing question. Look, I mean, the reality is, it's both an opportunity and a risk. We don't know. The freight recession has been a real thing. As you know, we've talked about inventory de-stocking, and the role that that played in demand in our industry for several quarters now. And we're confident that that pressure relief during the third quarter. Questions remain about the U.S. economy, what's going to happen to the consumer, what will demand be as we head into 2024? I guess, we don't really know that. Do I think that the quality of our service warrants a good discussion with our customers about our costs? Absolutely. So will there be an attempt? And will we talk about the need that we have and the costs that we're faced with? Absolutely, we will. But we're going to have to wait and see how that plays out.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, this is Nick. I'll talk about [Indiscernible] retention. We did face some pressure in the quarter on some losses of a couple of accounts that to competition. We also had an account or two, smaller account or two that went bankrupt. And then just our CBD process as our customer's business slows down, we try to value engineer and reduce fleets. So with all that being said, the way we reduced or we measure that retention, there was some loss in there from same store sales a quarter ago. Can't tell you what the future is going to be. I don't know what the economy is going to be. I do feel very confident with our execution and our discipline around all that. And so, I feel good about the future, but I can't predict what the next two or three quarters are going to provide.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to ask one on the acquisition of the brokerage business from [BNSF] (ph) Logistics. Is there anything you can share on the impact this could have on both the top line and the bottom line? And as you think about the longer term, does this deal change your strategy for ICS, including your targets on profitability?\nBrad Hicks: Hey, Justin. This is Brad Hicks. Let me start by just saying that, when we evaluated that acquisition, we saw several elements that we liked. One in particular is just how their customer base complements against our customer base. The other side of that is, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the welcoming of the agents. That's a new area of investment for us. And so, we do feel like we want to figure that out and then look to exploit that. And when you really think about the backdrop of the breadth of services that J.B. Hunt can offer, we really feel like that could maximize the potential of the agent business model. And so, we're really excited about that. As we think about the deal itself, I mentioned that we'll have some lingering costs in Q4. We think that those will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million in part due to acquisition costs as well as integration-related expenses. And then, just as a -- maybe a baseline benchmark, we feel like in Q4, that's going to generate an incremental approximately $100 million worth of revenue for ICS.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, everyone. I just -- Darren, I just wanted to go back to volume. We've kind of been in this one step forward, one step back dynamic with volumes really since January. And there's obviously some cyclical things going on that are good in terms of the west coast imports maybe a couple months ago and you're taking some market share, but there are some leading indicators that are showing maybe the volume coming into the west coast ports is coming down as the peak season is a little bit muted. And so, I want to kind of balance that with maybe the confidence that you all are kind of exuding on volume and just trying to understand, could we be I the situation a couple months from now where what we're seeing in September and August is a little bit of a head fake from a volume perspective. Just help us with the confidence that you have in terms of what you're seeing and ability to kind of continue on that trend.\nJohn Roberts: Well, Amit, thanks. I think the tough part about a volume conversation is, our customers haven't been very accurate with their forecast or their ability to predict what their needs are. What they are confident in, and our confidence remains high on is that, when they do have a need, we're a go-to provider for them. And we continue to grow confidence out of our customers in our execution ability, our capacity, our willingness to start up new business quickly. And so, our approach to that will continue to be the same. Our customers are under cost pressure. And one of the ways they can save money is convert their highway business back to intermodal. And so, we're going to be very focused on our ability to grow there. I also can't help but -- I mean, we're winning share in the market. Any kind of growth to the West coast will be a benefit for us. I also think the last 12 months have been so confusing based on the way our customers managed inventory. It's really, I don't think anything has been predictable. And so, we're very confident in the product we're offering. We're confident that we're going to be there for our customers and we're going to continue to offer a product that they want to use and that's what we can control.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to tie all that up, Darren, can you give us some sense as to how the rest of peak season is going here into October after those records in September? And then just more broadly speaking, as you talk to folks for next year and the shippers that you're dealing with, go you get a sense that any of them are trying to lock in capacity for potential uptick and they want to get something on board before rates start to move up? Or do you feel like there's still a little bit more inflation that they want to get out of their system from freight rates and maybe they're taking a harder look to start the year. And maybe one more last bite of the apple. So any sense in terms of partnership positioning and outlook for next year will be helpful? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Well, let me start with sort of the exit from Q3 into Q4. I mean, we continue to bring equipment out of storage. None of our equipment has gone back into storage and demand remains really, really strong, just as it was throughout September. So far, here we are. It's October 17th. Things have effectively continued coming out of the back end of September as they were.\nJohn Roberts: Now, I think you asked the question, Brian, about expectations and whether or not shippers would have another bite of the apple. I just -- I think Darren sort of already addressed, it's too soon to comment on what pricing expectations will look like next year\u2026\nDarren Field: I think there's been a -- let me just say, there's been a handful of customers that are at least engaged in dialogue around what maybe we're seeing. So it's different than, hey, I'm going to bid your business, I want another rate reduction. There is a sense of I don't want to accidentally run out of capacity in any of my service offerings, so it's at least a dialogue. I don't want that to represent as if they're busy trying to lock up capacity right now. I mean, I do think customers would love to lock in low prices and that's where -- back to my earlier comments, where we've earned the right to have a conversation about cost challenges we have. And I think that that's been at least understood. Not telling anybody's agreeing to anything. There's just still a lot of questions out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. So, I think you guys are flagging competitive risk in multiple segments, dedicated, ICS, I think maybe also IM. Is this a surprise? And kind of where's this pressure coming from? Is it coming from other public companies? Is it coming from small and mid-sized carriers? And just to follow up on the IM side, a related question. You said that you feel like you're taking share and that's driven some of this volume acceleration. Again, is that share exclusively from truck or are you also taking share from other IMCs?\nJohn Roberts: Where do you want to start, Brad?\nBrad Delco: Yeah, I'll have Darren start on the intermodal side and then I'll let Nick talk about the competitive dynamics that he's seeing to the extent he is seeing it in DCS and then Brad Hicks can wrap up with comments on brokerage and what he's seeing on Power Only.\nDarren Field: I think we're taking share both from the highway and from other intermodal channels. I've been really proud of the team's focus and efforts on the highway conversion front, but inevitably there have been pricing actions by our customers earlier in the year, and maybe we didn't win something, and three months later, they come back, and through a mini bid, we win it a second time because maybe a provider struggled to service that opportunity. And that's not new. That happens every year, but that has certainly been something at play here this summer.\nNick Hobbs: For the dedicated, I'd just say that the fleets that we lost were a couple of other publicly traded companies and we just couldn't match that from a return standpoint. So we walked away. But I would say that if you look at our pipeline, we have a healthy pipeline and the deals that we've won and priced meet our return requirements, so we're very happy with that. So we're always fighting competition out there. So I feel good about the future and where we're going.\nBrad Hicks: And I'll round it out from maybe what we're seeing in brokerage. I think that in brokerage, as you all well know, it's been an incredibly difficult environment. Radical swings in rate from just 12 months to 18 months ago versus what we see today, so it is probably more competitive in the brokerage segment than what you heard from Nick and Darren. It's a fight out there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we hold some freight that was not favorable for us, but we've also lost some freight due to the competitive bid process that our customers took advantage of or utilized during this bid season. But I'll tie it back to our acquisition and really the value of J.B. Hunt 360 and what we see is letting our platform execute and creating that value for our customers. And so with that acquisition and where we're at, I largely feel like we're at the bottom and just kind of bouncing along. But there is extreme pressure on PTE. And so we do see carriers pushing back on the floor of what PTE is today and really just kind of navigating those choppy waters as we work through the beginning of the fourth quarter.\nShelley Simpson: Ravi, I would also say, it I feel like organizationally we want to be physically responsible and take a long-term view on the business that we have and also business that we onboard. If you heard anything from kind of what these three presidents have talked about, Nick's comments around not making a proper return, we aren't talking about a couple of points here. These are dramatic changes that maybe our competitors decided to be strategic with that account for whatever reason. And we believe the best decision for J.B. Hunt and the health of our business and our customers long term is to walk away from that business. Same thing from Brad's perspective, really challenging what's happening in the market. I think Brad is leading in that space and really talking to our customers about the long term benefit, long term value. Has that business been able to be as sticky as we would like? No, I do think Brad's comments around it being, we're in a fight there. I think, the fight doesn't last for that long. You can't lose money for a long period of time in this business. And so, I think for us we take a long-term view. I think in intermodal, we're largely where we thought we'd be, maybe at the lower end of our pricing expectations, but pleased with what our customers have talked to us about and where we are moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Shelley, maybe to follow-up from that and the idea about being disciplined around capital, because you guys have been reinvesting the business here for the last two years at pretty elevated rates. And I know we had the pandemic in the last five years, but intermodal volumes have really been kind of stagnant looking back that far. I guess, what do you guys see in the next five years that transitions out of this stagnant volume outcomes? I know there's been a lot of changes with the rails of the pandemic, but I guess the fear here, and I think historically you guys were always valued higher because of the focus on ROIC, but maybe are we just over investing this cycle now?\nShelley Simpson: Well, let me say this Brandon, I think our customers -- Darren mentioned this earlier, our customers are struggling still with what their forecast will look like. And I know we gave an update on this earlier but I just -- we completed bid season. I would expect our customers to have made material improvements in what freight they are giving us, so bid compliance. And we have not seen a major change in our bid compliance. So I think we're up into the mid-60s now in intermodal. Just for comparisons, if you went back to 2017, that would be in the 90s. So customers are struggling to know what's going to happen from a forecasting perspective. If you're to look at the one-way parts of our business, intermodal, JBT, and inside ICS, those businesses are ranging with bids fully implemented between mid-50s and mid-60s. That's difficult for us to think about our networks and what that will look like, but we also know that customers aren't satisfied with that either. This is the reason you're seeing mini-bids trying to find that equilibrium on or the right balance between price, service, and cost overall. And then I should say where we are investing, remember in 2022, a big part of our investment that carried over into 2023 was our lack of ability to get equipment, particularly on the tractor side. So if you see our fleet replenishment and making sure that we're in good shape there. But also in intermodal, what Darren talked about, our ability to move very quickly with our customer was a key to our success in September and even moving into October. You heard Darren say we're continuing to unstack. Those aren't 100 at a time. You're talking about big numbers that we're swinging dramatically. And so for us, we know what it looks like to shut down our supply chain. We did it in 2020 in intermodal. It was very difficult to onboard equipment and to get things moving again. I do think that we're doing a nice job evaluating what our customers are saying with our own experience to that and trying to plan out how much equipment that should look like. We still believe in our long-term future. Our customers believe in it as well. And I might just echo one more thing. I think our customers had a lot of questions in the first half of the year. They were struggling on inventory. They were trying to determine. Our conversations have shifted slightly into now they have confidence at intermodal, at least our intermodal products can deliver. That's what's given them so much confidence to talk through this, but also recognizing there are so many shipments on the highways that need to convert. That's why we made the release to go to 150,000 intermodal containers. So for us, it's down to a little bit of timing. Certainly we don't price our business based on how much equipment we have. We price our business based on each customer, what the market looks like and what balance looks like as well. And if we want to move into storage, that's us being disciplined in our approach not to distort the market dramatically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Shelley or Darren, I just want to revisit the leverage part of the intermodal model. Your volumes were up again, but the margin was at a cycle low, maybe a multi-cycle low. So is this strictly a function of carrying too many resources, you need the volume to come back, once you get the volume you can add significantly more without adding resources and you get the margin improvement there. Or how much of it is actually moving the pricing needle and then therefore do we have to wait for kind of a full year of resetting the price before we can kind of revisit the bottom end of the long-term range?\nDarren Field: Well, so I've said this multiple times. Volume is maybe a little bit more valuable to our margin today than it ever has been because of the amount of capacity we've had underutilized. So yes, volume is one of the key components. But volume proportionally doesn't move the margin needle near as fast as price does. The harsh reality is, we need both of those elements. Pricing has long been a lagging indicator. And here you are at the end of Q3 and you can see the results from more or less a fully implemented recent bid cycle, and now we're going to go into a new one. And so you don't get to see the full results of that, probably until next summer, the end of Q3. Meanwhile, we'll be looking to grow and unlock benefits there. But there is no magic recipe here. We need both of those elements and that's why we're so focused on delivering excellent service so that we can generate the value for our customers that translates into an appropriate return on our investments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. Shelly, thank you and your team for answering all that you have. I want to ask a question a different way. You've seen a lot of cycles, and each one's unique, and each one's different. I think what's different about this one is, we came out of this extremely tight capacity situation and into a very loose one because of de-stocking. I hear you saying we see signs that looks like it's ending. But what is different in terms about managing this cycle than the previous cycles? And kind of to the question that's been asked two or three times, based on where you are right now, when do you think on a corporate basis we come out of this volume morass? And when do you think on a corporate basis we're in a position to realize higher yields on the service you're providing because of the higher costs?\nShelley Simpson: Yes, thank you for that conversation Jeff. And you know I would say we have had a lot of experiencing managing through the cycles. I do want to repeat something that I've said previously, and that is, this great recession largely resembles the great economic recession of 2009. I think when I look back to what we did, and we did a great job was really investing in our people, making sure that our people felt safe, our people understood our long-term strategy, and we did a great job coming through that. I believe for us in this near term, continuing to evaluate what our customers are saying compared to what's happening in the market and making sure that we're prudent in our short term costs while not losing long term focus, I think is very important for us continuing moving forward. You've heard Darren talk about pricing, you've heard Brad talk about pricing. I think the cautiousness that you hear from us is, we can talk about a freight recession. We're not experts on what's going to happen in the economy. We don't have customers negative. I would say they are neutral to positive. But I don't know that anybody is an expert here as to what's going to happen from an overall freight demand perspective. So it's difficult for us to see what's happening moving forward. I will tell you, we're not changing our margin targets. We are very focused on delivering value for our customers. We know that we can deliver value for customers. Our customers will pay us an appropriate return and therefore delivers long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. That's our focus. Our entire company, all 35,000, really focus on making sure we do that very well. We deliver for our customers and we look at it from their lens. We have a great opportunity to eliminate waste through mode converting into intermode, using the power of the platform and how we service it, continuing to differentiate our value inside our final mile business segment, and delivering the most efficient fleets through our dedicated contract services. That's our overall vision. That's how we talk to customers, and we believe that can deliver the right returns over the long term. But also if we see something changing in the near term, we'll continue to adjust, have conversations with customers, and make sure that we are delivering on the promises that we're making.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Your quarter end dedicated truck count rose for the first time in a year this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about if you think we're through the worst of the like-for-like shrinkage and in customer churn and whether or not that can be stable to grow again? And you know if we end up in that environment the next year, do a lot of costs have to come back to support that growth after you've been in degrowth mode for several quarters? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I would just say that, based on our -- first of all, we think that we're flat, stable is what I would say. If I look at our renewals and things coming up, I feel that we're in a pretty good position there. Talking with our customers feel pretty stable. And then our pipeline is healthy. So I like where we're at. We're going to hit our targets. We feel very comfortable hitting our sales targets. And I think that sets us up hopefully very good, but again, I don't know what the economy is going to do and how people are going to react to that. But I will just say that our customers, our new customers that we're out pursuing, they're still loving the product that we have out there. We're still successful in the sales. So that says even in this environment, we have a lot of interest out there. So we're only 4% to 5% percent of the market. And so we feel good about the future.\nBrad Delco: Hey, Bascome, this is Brad Delco. I do want to add just a little bit more to that, though. I mean, keep in mind, too, when Nick's saying that the fleet is stable, there have been startups throughout this year. And so, we -- as Nick alluded to, we expect to hit our sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks this year, that has come with some shrinkage at some of the accounts, that has come with losing some accounts that we've already talked about and reflected in sort of the 94% retention versus what was previously usually north of 98%. But we have had startups and we've had margins hold up relatively well. And so, hopefully, again, depending on things outside of our control with the economy, we could grow our fleet without seeing maybe the extreme types of pressure on margins that we saw during some of those COVID years when we were bringing on several thousand trucks a year, which was more unusual in terms of the pace of growth.\nNick Hobbs: And the other thing on the truck that we don't need to lose during the year were, there was about 600 trucks that we had extra from having old trucks out there. So we take that out of there and it paints a little different picture. So we feel good about that.\nShelley Simpson: Nick, let me add to that just a bit, because that's exactly what I was going to try to talk through, is that, you've done a great job taking out the incremental trucks that we've had, having to carry, because we couldn't get new equipment. But also the CBD work that you've done, being offensive in our strategy there.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, so we've done a lot of one to two truck reductions at existing accounts, and we've seen that through the history. You asked about our history as we do that through down cycles, it pays back in dividends from those trucks coming back plus some others. So we really feel good about that. If I look at the business we priced in 2022 and how it's performing in 2023, it's performing exactly the way we priced it and that's with the cost in there and that's with the proper return. So we feel very solid about our dedicated model.\nShelley Simpson: And I think my point to that is, that's our long-term view, making sure that we flex with our customers, understanding that we're in dedicated fleets for a long period of time in total, and I think that's a good thing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. So, team, I'd like to ask you a little bit about driver availability and hiring from a capacity perspective. And we've heard a lot over the last five, 10 years talking about driver shortages. Could you talk a little bit about the labor environment when you're hiring for dedicated and intermodal? And then also from a capacity perspective, as you look at the brokerage business, are you seeing any signs of capacity rationalization in the truckload market that you can point us to in terms of trying to get supply and demand back into a better balance? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, I'll take -- this is Nick. I'll take the driver's side. Good, really solid drivers are still hard to find. We are finding them. They're much more available than they have been. But we feel very good about the supply of drivers. We still have pockets in different areas that are tied. And the driver wages are not going anywhere. They're staying up. There's a lot of demand out there for other jobs, so we don't see the driver wages really going down. But with our corporate driver personnel group, we are able to find the drivers we need right now.\nJohn Roberts: I think from a carrier community, we are seeing the pressure kind of show itself with reductions or some losses and closures. But I also feel like that difficult backdrop of the brokerage environment and what -- when I mentioned that, they're pushing back on the lowering cost of PTE to kind of come in line with what customer rates have done. And so, to me that's the signal that says they're at that breaking point. And so, while it hasn't been in high volume yet, we do anticipate that we will continue to see an increase in losses or closures as we move forward deeper into 2023, into 2024, as long as this rate environment persists. And so, we have seen that continue to gain momentum, not at macro scale yet, but I think that that's just a matter of time. There's only so long that the carriers can hang on with the low rates.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to turn the call over to President, Shelley Simpson for some closing remarks.\nShelley Simpson: So thank you so much for joining our call. I will say that you've heard us talk through this last hour really as to where we see the businesses today, but also focused on our future and what our long-term prospects are across all five of our business segments. We do love the complementary nature of all five of our segments as our customers really ask us to help them through the North American supply chain. We feel like that we can answer our customers with any of those five segments. Pleased with the volume growth in Intermodal and what our customers have told us that they want to buy from us. We're starting to see that in our results. We love the resiliency of our dedicated model and I think you're seeing that play out here in the third quarter. Very pleased with our progress in final mile. We didn't talk about that much, but very pleased with us continuing to push our customers on making sure that we are paid appropriately for the value that we create. And also pleased with what's happening inside 360 Box with volume growth overall. The freight environment has been challenging. That is nothing new to our team. It's not a matter of if, but when, we actually come completely out of the freight recession. But we are encouraged by some of the results in some of our businesses. I would say, in total, we're very proud of our people. And in this environment, for us to be able to flex in all of our businesses and make sure that we are delivering on what our customers are asking us for is the highlight of everything that we do. Sometimes our people are working so hard and they don't get to see the fruit of their labor, but I would tell you, they're working harder today than they've ever worked in total. For that we're super proud of our team. We remain committed to our team and remain committed in our three key priorities, delivering value for our customers, committed to our people, and finally committed to long-term returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd love to turn it over to John Roberts, our CEO, for final thoughts.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Shelley. Very well said. I continue to land on your idea here that this recovery is not an if question at all. It's a win question. I really appreciate and respect the callers need more on the win. We wish we could give you more. The compliance data definitely tells us that we're all working towards a better understanding, but the data and the results in the quarter tell us that there's a lot of headwind out there. But I think we continue to find our way back to this idea of people and experience. And the people on this leadership team have an absolute ton of experience. And that gives us confidence to not feel like we have to make short-term decisions when we know what the right long-term decisions are. For instance, When we talk about our container ads, we use very large micro numbers, but I want to emphasize that was a very, very precise calculation made with the railroads on, real capacity, real availability, real conversion opportunity. We didn't just make up a number there. And when we don't see that demand, we look at and we alter the timing. But what Shelley said is so vitally important. When we were asked questions about just today, the volume in Intermodal. What drove the volume down in Intermodal was PSR, very, very simply. And we reacted to that by completely shutting down our desire to continue to bring on equipment that is extraordinarily hard to source and takes a very long time to get landed. That's experience working right there for you. Saying, hey, we did the calculation, we did the math. These assets have an extraordinarily long life. They sit quietly. We're not out stockpiling Class 8 tractors. We're buying the right assets. When I ask myself, how can we best position the company for the win, for the win we recover? We have to invest in the right assets and we have to learn from our experiences and when we apply that, it's just preparation for the win. I totally appreciate what the folks on this call do, but when you're here with us in this room, we're looking at that long term. So much real good conversation on CapEx and it is elevated and that is a very serious matter, but I want to reiterate the drivers behind that were a shortage of supply. We don't really talk about the impact that shortage of supply has on our system, but when we carry equipment over its natural life, you have to carry extra, you have to fix it more, you have to park it more. We're looking at that with our OEMs saying, wait a second, let's think this through like we're thinking through container management. And those are all capital events. I am, like Shelly, really pleased with the progress in final mile. I think that's an important business for us and I know there's a lot of pressure on it. I'm thankful for the discipline that I see in the businesses when we're under so much volume pressure to have the experience to know that holding on to bad deals is not going to turn out right in the long run. We have tried those exercises. They don't really work for us. We have such great visibility into every aspect of the company. Every single fleet in DCS has its own standalone P&L. We know top to bottom what's happening in there. And categorically, if you go around the businesses, we know where we have the problems and we just aren't tolerant to sit. And if someone else was to do it at those margins, then that's fine with us. We'll be ready when the right business comes along. But finally, I'd just say that Shelley is exactly right. The most important asset we have are the 35,000 people that work here. And the investments that we'll make in them, in the technology and in the capacity that will take us where we're going are well in place, well supported, and are underpinned by something that I wrote down that Shelley said that I, it's one of my new favorite phrases, but you can remain prudent with short-term costs while maintaining a long-term focus. With that, we thank you for calling in today. Talk to you in a quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our integrated capacity solutions and truckload segments. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Before I begin, I would like to publicly welcome the new employees we recently onboarded, as well as the agents from our acquisition of the brokerage operations of BNSF Logistics. We are excited about the opportunities this creates to leverage our investments in technology and the breadth of services we provide to better serve our customers. Starting with ICS, overall, the brokerage environment remains challenged and competitive. Segment gross revenue was down 48% year-over-year, driven by a 38% decline in volume and a 17% decline in revenue per load. Overall truckload demand, particularly in the spot market, remains muted versus the prior year period. During the quarter, we did elect to focus our efforts on revenue quality and leading the market to push rates on certain lanes and accounts to appropriate levels. As a result, we did cull a decent amount of revenue and freight from our portfolio. As the quarter progressed, though, we did see a sequential improvement in gross profit dollars per load, particularly in our spot business, but also in our contractual business. We continue to invest in areas to mitigate strategic theft, enhance capability in our platform, and right-side resources with our current demand through attrition. Overall we believe some of these changes will position us for better success in the future. Wrapping up on ICS and to level set a little on expectations in the near term, we are seeing some margin pressure related to peak season so far in Q4, in addition to expecting some dilution from the recent acquisition in the fourth quarter. Shifting now over to JBT or truck load, segment gross revenue was down 17% year-over-year, driven by a 22% decline in revenue per load and partially offset by a 6% increase in volumes. Overall demand for our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up double digits versus the prior year. Customers continue to see value in the flexibility and efficiency of combining the drop trailer capacity with the ability to source the right carrier on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform to move the trailer. The right carrier on the right load and at the right price, that's the power of the platform. Going forward, we will continue to make investments in the development of our 360 box offering to strengthen this product and drive greater efficiency for our customers. Overall, we believe there's growing demand in the market for this service offering and we see long-term opportunities in this area. Wrapping up on 360, as you have heard throughout our comments, we remain committed to investments in our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. I think it's appropriate to point out that technology as a foundation between our people and capacity is the link that connects them. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity, and creates efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. That capacity comes in the form of our own assets or the assets we can secure for or on behalf of our customers. J.B. Hunt 360 is our platform that empowers and enables our people and helps us access the right capacity to serve our customers efficiently with a valuable service. Our platform, J.B. Hunt 360, informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments. This concludes my comments, so I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Hey, Justin. This is Brad Hicks. Let me start by just saying that, when we evaluated that acquisition, we saw several elements that we liked. One in particular is just how their customer base complements against our customer base. The other side of that is, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the welcoming of the agents. That's a new area of investment for us. And so, we do feel like we want to figure that out and then look to exploit that. And when you really think about the backdrop of the breadth of services that J.B. Hunt can offer, we really feel like that could maximize the potential of the agent business model. And so, we're really excited about that. As we think about the deal itself, I mentioned that we'll have some lingering costs in Q4. We think that those will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million in part due to acquisition costs as well as integration-related expenses. And then, just as a -- maybe a baseline benchmark, we feel like in Q4, that's going to generate an incremental approximately $100 million worth of revenue for ICS. And I'll round it out from maybe what we're seeing in brokerage. I think that in brokerage, as you all well know, it's been an incredibly difficult environment. Radical swings in rate from just 12 months to 18 months ago versus what we see today, so it is probably more competitive in the brokerage segment than what you heard from Nick and Darren. It's a fight out there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we hold some freight that was not favorable for us, but we've also lost some freight due to the competitive bid process that our customers took advantage of or utilized during this bid season. But I'll tie it back to our acquisition and really the value of J.B. Hunt 360 and what we see is letting our platform execute and creating that value for our customers. And so with that acquisition and where we're at, I largely feel like we're at the bottom and just kind of bouncing along. But there is extreme pressure on PTE. And so we do see carriers pushing back on the floor of what PTE is today and really just kind of navigating those choppy waters as we work through the beginning of the fourth quarter."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll be brief with my comments, but I want to hit on a few items, including a high-level review of the quarter and an update on our capital plan. So starting with third quarter results, overall freight activity remained under pressure during the quarter as compared to last year. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 18% year-over-year. Operating income declined 33% and diluted earnings per share decreased 30%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes and yields combined with inflationary cost pressures primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs, and insurance and claims expense. We did have a discrete tax item in the quarter which lowered our effective tax rate to 18.2%. The overall impact to our earnings in the quarter was $0.16 per share spread across the tax and interest expense line items. We continue to make investments in our business for the long term across our company foundations, our people, technology, and capacity. From an invested capital standpoint these investments are in real estate, equipment, both trailing and power, and as previously mentioned, we did close on the purchase of the brokerage assets from BNSF Logistics in the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments. We are conservatively leveraged at still below our target of one-times debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. Our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn and available as needed. I previously guided to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion of net capital spent for the year. Excluding the acquisition, we anticipate falling around $1.6 billion for the year. Similar to last quarter, some of this is timing related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense with our spend. In terms of our capital priorities, no change on this front. First and foremost, we will continue to invest to grow our business. We will maintain an investment-grade credit rating and support our dividend. And finally, we will use excess cash to repurchase stock. In the third quarter we repurchased approximately 267,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick. And Ken, just from a CapEx standpoint, broadly speaking, we've been talking about how we had to retain a lot of equipment in 2021 and 2022 just because of the inability to get that. I think that we've made a lot of great progress on working through our replacements in 2023. We'll still have some in 2024. As you know, all of our growth CapEx is principally success-based through dedicated and even with intermodal. We are carrying, as we've talked about, excess container equipment right now, but we'll work through that and then we'll purchase new as our growth plans deem necessary."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our dedicated and final mile segments and we'll give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. I remain pleased with the performance of our dedicated business in the quarter and the resiliency of our model. Demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well in the environment, and we continue to see many opportunities in our pipeline. In the quarter, we sold approximately 265 trucks in new deals, which brings us to over 830 year to day. We are feeling more confident in hitting our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year. Based on the timing of some deals that push from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although we have seen some slightly higher customer churn than we previously expected. In the instances where we have lost an account, we believe the business was lost at inadequate rates of return, particularly considering the value proposition we bring to our clients. Going forward, we remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver value in the market that will allow us to compound our growth over many, many years and further penetrate our large addressable market. Now on to final mile. I am pleased with our performance in the quarter and how we have positioned ourselves as a premium service provider in the industry. I believe we have been able to prove our value propositions as we are nearing the end of some of our work to improve the revenue quality of our portfolio of business. This is evidenced by the year-over-year improvement in profitability in the segment despite lower revenue. In terms of the end markets we serve, we are seeing a slight uptick in demand across some of our end markets in the segment, although furniture deliveries remain in a tough spot. We continue to focus on providing a superior service experience, delivering big and bulky items into the homes of our customer's customer. This continues to resonate well in the market and as a result we see new brands engaging in discussions and being added to our sales pipeline. Similar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety in our equipment. We continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies that will improve and enhance our safety performance as an organization. This very much aligns with our company foundations taking care of our people, but also the motoring public. We continue to roll out inward facing cameras in our fleet and remain on track to be 60% complete of our fleet by the end of the year. We are encouraged by the data we have seen so far since this initiative has gotten underway and also encouraged by the impact this should have on our cost to serve our customers. As the industry is well aware, the cost of claims continue to just move higher and higher, and we are feverishly working to mitigate the risk. Finally, a quick update on equipment. I previously stated that we would be complete with cleaning our older equipment by the end of the third quarter. We've had a couple hundred units spill into the fourth quarter, but I would say we are in a very good position with our equipment across all businesses. I would say we are finally caught up with some of the backlogs that were created as a result of the pandemic and our rapid growth over the last few years. This concludes my remarks, so I would like to now turn the call over to Darren. Yeah, this is Nick. I'll talk about [Indiscernible] retention. We did face some pressure in the quarter on some losses of a couple of accounts that to competition. We also had an account or two, smaller account or two that went bankrupt. And then just our CBD process as our customer's business slows down, we try to value engineer and reduce fleets. So with all that being said, the way we reduced or we measure that retention, there was some loss in there from same store sales a quarter ago. Can't tell you what the future is going to be. I don't know what the economy is going to be. I do feel very confident with our execution and our discipline around all that. And so, I feel good about the future, but I can't predict what the next two or three quarters are going to provide. For the dedicated, I'd just say that the fleets that we lost were a couple of other publicly traded companies and we just couldn't match that from a return standpoint. So we walked away. But I would say that if you look at our pipeline, we have a healthy pipeline and the deals that we've won and priced meet our return requirements, so we're very happy with that. So we're always fighting competition out there. So I feel good about the future and where we're going. Yes, I would just say that, based on our -- first of all, we think that we're flat, stable is what I would say. If I look at our renewals and things coming up, I feel that we're in a pretty good position there. Talking with our customers feel pretty stable. And then our pipeline is healthy. So I like where we're at. We're going to hit our targets. We feel very comfortable hitting our sales targets. And I think that sets us up hopefully very good, but again, I don't know what the economy is going to do and how people are going to react to that. But I will just say that our customers, our new customers that we're out pursuing, they're still loving the product that we have out there. We're still successful in the sales. So that says even in this environment, we have a lot of interest out there. So we're only 4% to 5% percent of the market. And so we feel good about the future. And the other thing on the truck that we don't need to lose during the year were, there was about 600 trucks that we had extra from having old trucks out there. So we take that out of there and it paints a little different picture. So we feel good about that. Yeah, so we've done a lot of one to two truck reductions at existing accounts, and we've seen that through the history. You asked about our history as we do that through down cycles, it pays back in dividends from those trucks coming back plus some others. So we really feel good about that. If I look at the business we priced in 2022 and how it's performing in 2023, it's performing exactly the way we priced it and that's with the cost in there and that's with the proper return. So we feel very solid about our dedicated model. Yeah, I'll take -- this is Nick. I'll take the driver's side. Good, really solid drivers are still hard to find. We are finding them. They're much more available than they have been. But we feel very good about the supply of drivers. We still have pockets in different areas that are tied. And the driver wages are not going anywhere. They're staying up. There's a lot of demand out there for other jobs, so we don't see the driver wages really going down. But with our corporate driver personnel group, we are able to find the drivers we need right now."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. My comments will cover our areas of strategic focus and how we are setting ourselves up for long-term success. Of course, these comments will align with our priorities for 2023, which, as a reminder, are to, first, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; second, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and third, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As you've heard us say since the fourth quarter call earlier this year, we have been in a challenging freight environment or a freight recession, largely driven by excess inventory in the supply chain. Our customers have been working through excess inventory, and as we stated last quarter, we felt like that de-stocking trend started to moderate in June. As we sit here today, we see further evidence of this trend, and most notably in our intermodal business, which is at the forefront of the North American supply chain. To be clear on the overall environment, we are not at a point yet to say we're out of the freight recession, but we do feel like we're coming out of it or said differently, directionally we are seeing signs of things moving in a positive direction. Going forward, our focus remains on how we deliver value for, and grow with our customers over the long term by finding ways to improve efficiency and drive waste out of the supply chain. As you've heard us say before, we have a long-term approach to how we manage our business and how we invest across our company foundations, which are our people, technology, and capacity. Our people have always come first, and we remain committed to our investments in our people, in proper training, in their safety, and in fair and equitable compensation and benefits. Throughout our company, we have the experience and talent to execute in all types of environments. As an example, the officers of our company have a collective 350 years of experience, not just in the industry, but at our company. The experience and talents of our people combined with our capacity to deliver and connected and enhanced by our technology investments are what combine to deliver exceptional value for our customers. I believe we're seeing evidence of the strength of our brand and service by staying committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity. As we progress in the recovery, I'm confident in our ability to meet the growing needs of our customers as a result. In closing, while the environment is still challenging, it is important to keep in mind that pricing is a lagging indicator, while volume is typically a leading indicator. We are encouraged by the performance of our intermodal business that is gaining share in the market and the resiliency of our dedicated business, they continue to deliver efficient solutions for customers. Our final mile business is holding up well despite seeing varying degrees of demand from the end markets which they serve, highlighting the quality of our premium service product. And in our ICS and JBT business, we continue to see both segments feel the brunt of the freight cycle, most notably in price and volume. They continue to believe in our ability to scale this business to drive efficient solutions with our brokerage and drop trailer services. We will continue to manage the business for long-term growth, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term, sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Ravi, I would also say, it I feel like organizationally we want to be physically responsible and take a long-term view on the business that we have and also business that we onboard. If you heard anything from kind of what these three presidents have talked about, Nick's comments around not making a proper return, we aren't talking about a couple of points here. These are dramatic changes that maybe our competitors decided to be strategic with that account for whatever reason. And we believe the best decision for J.B. Hunt and the health of our business and our customers long term is to walk away from that business. Same thing from Brad's perspective, really challenging what's happening in the market. I think Brad is leading in that space and really talking to our customers about the long term benefit, long term value. Has that business been able to be as sticky as we would like? No, I do think Brad's comments around it being, we're in a fight there. I think, the fight doesn't last for that long. You can't lose money for a long period of time in this business. And so, I think for us we take a long-term view. I think in intermodal, we're largely where we thought we'd be, maybe at the lower end of our pricing expectations, but pleased with what our customers have talked to us about and where we are moving forward. Well, let me say this Brandon, I think our customers -- Darren mentioned this earlier, our customers are struggling still with what their forecast will look like. And I know we gave an update on this earlier but I just -- we completed bid season. I would expect our customers to have made material improvements in what freight they are giving us, so bid compliance. And we have not seen a major change in our bid compliance. So I think we're up into the mid-60s now in intermodal. Just for comparisons, if you went back to 2017, that would be in the 90s. So customers are struggling to know what's going to happen from a forecasting perspective. If you're to look at the one-way parts of our business, intermodal, JBT, and inside ICS, those businesses are ranging with bids fully implemented between mid-50s and mid-60s. That's difficult for us to think about our networks and what that will look like, but we also know that customers aren't satisfied with that either. This is the reason you're seeing mini-bids trying to find that equilibrium on or the right balance between price, service, and cost overall. And then I should say where we are investing, remember in 2022, a big part of our investment that carried over into 2023 was our lack of ability to get equipment, particularly on the tractor side. So if you see our fleet replenishment and making sure that we're in good shape there. But also in intermodal, what Darren talked about, our ability to move very quickly with our customer was a key to our success in September and even moving into October. You heard Darren say we're continuing to unstack. Those aren't 100 at a time. You're talking about big numbers that we're swinging dramatically. And so for us, we know what it looks like to shut down our supply chain. We did it in 2020 in intermodal. It was very difficult to onboard equipment and to get things moving again. I do think that we're doing a nice job evaluating what our customers are saying with our own experience to that and trying to plan out how much equipment that should look like. We still believe in our long-term future. Our customers believe in it as well. And I might just echo one more thing. I think our customers had a lot of questions in the first half of the year. They were struggling on inventory. They were trying to determine. Our conversations have shifted slightly into now they have confidence at intermodal, at least our intermodal products can deliver. That's what's given them so much confidence to talk through this, but also recognizing there are so many shipments on the highways that need to convert. That's why we made the release to go to 150,000 intermodal containers. So for us, it's down to a little bit of timing. Certainly we don't price our business based on how much equipment we have. We price our business based on each customer, what the market looks like and what balance looks like as well. And if we want to move into storage, that's us being disciplined in our approach not to distort the market dramatically. Yes, thank you for that conversation Jeff. And you know I would say we have had a lot of experiencing managing through the cycles. I do want to repeat something that I've said previously, and that is, this great recession largely resembles the great economic recession of 2009. I think when I look back to what we did, and we did a great job was really investing in our people, making sure that our people felt safe, our people understood our long-term strategy, and we did a great job coming through that. I believe for us in this near term, continuing to evaluate what our customers are saying compared to what's happening in the market and making sure that we're prudent in our short term costs while not losing long term focus, I think is very important for us continuing moving forward. You've heard Darren talk about pricing, you've heard Brad talk about pricing. I think the cautiousness that you hear from us is, we can talk about a freight recession. We're not experts on what's going to happen in the economy. We don't have customers negative. I would say they are neutral to positive. But I don't know that anybody is an expert here as to what's going to happen from an overall freight demand perspective. So it's difficult for us to see what's happening moving forward. I will tell you, we're not changing our margin targets. We are very focused on delivering value for our customers. We know that we can deliver value for customers. Our customers will pay us an appropriate return and therefore delivers long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. That's our focus. Our entire company, all 35,000, really focus on making sure we do that very well. We deliver for our customers and we look at it from their lens. We have a great opportunity to eliminate waste through mode converting into intermode, using the power of the platform and how we service it, continuing to differentiate our value inside our final mile business segment, and delivering the most efficient fleets through our dedicated contract services. That's our overall vision. That's how we talk to customers, and we believe that can deliver the right returns over the long term. But also if we see something changing in the near term, we'll continue to adjust, have conversations with customers, and make sure that we are delivering on the promises that we're making. Nick, let me add to that just a bit, because that's exactly what I was going to try to talk through, is that, you've done a great job taking out the incremental trucks that we've had, having to carry, because we couldn't get new equipment. But also the CBD work that you've done, being offensive in our strategy there. And I think my point to that is, that's our long-term view, making sure that we flex with our customers, understanding that we're in dedicated fleets for a long period of time in total, and I think that's a good thing. So thank you so much for joining our call. I will say that you've heard us talk through this last hour really as to where we see the businesses today, but also focused on our future and what our long-term prospects are across all five of our business segments. We do love the complementary nature of all five of our segments as our customers really ask us to help them through the North American supply chain. We feel like that we can answer our customers with any of those five segments. Pleased with the volume growth in Intermodal and what our customers have told us that they want to buy from us. We're starting to see that in our results. We love the resiliency of our dedicated model and I think you're seeing that play out here in the third quarter. Very pleased with our progress in final mile. We didn't talk about that much, but very pleased with us continuing to push our customers on making sure that we are paid appropriately for the value that we create. And also pleased with what's happening inside 360 Box with volume growth overall. The freight environment has been challenging. That is nothing new to our team. It's not a matter of if, but when, we actually come completely out of the freight recession. But we are encouraged by some of the results in some of our businesses. I would say, in total, we're very proud of our people. And in this environment, for us to be able to flex in all of our businesses and make sure that we are delivering on what our customers are asking us for is the highlight of everything that we do. Sometimes our people are working so hard and they don't get to see the fruit of their labor, but I would tell you, they're working harder today than they've ever worked in total. For that we're super proud of our team. We remain committed to our team and remain committed in our three key priorities, delivering value for our customers, committed to our people, and finally committed to long-term returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd love to turn it over to John Roberts, our CEO, for final thoughts."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'll review the performance of the intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and long-term growth for all of our stakeholders. I'll start by reviewing intermodal's performance in the quarter. As I said last quarter, and you heard Shelley say earlier, we believe the inventory destocking trend started to moderate in June. And we saw evidence of that trend continue throughout the quarter as our volumes inflected positive for the first time in three quarters. By month, our volumes were down 1% in July, up 1% in August, and up 4% in September. In September, we had our largest intermodal volume week in our history and we're able to meet the strong demand with exceptional service. I'm encouraged by the fact that we are seeing the volume lift across both our transcontinental and eastern network highlighting overall increased customer demand for our intermodal service. We believe this is driven by the overall market, but also we believe we are taking market share with our strong service that is outperforming the competition. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially, largely related to the full implementation of the recently repriced bids, which is a reminder trended toward the lower end of our pricing expectations as bid season progressed. We continue to carry resources and capacity and the related costs to ensure that the quality of our service holds up as customer demand for a differentiated service product grows. With regard to rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the intermodal offering and growing the overall market. In fact, I'd say that our rail providers are dialed in both in the East and the West. We believe that the railroads realize that the true test of their service will come once freight volumes increase with overall demand on their networks. But we and they are confident in their ability to maintain high service levels throughout the recovery. We are very encouraged by the current work we are doing with BNSF in the West and feel even more confident about our differentiated service. We now have J.B. Hunt employees in their headquarters in Fort Worth working side by side together to create and customize solutions for our customers and solving to eliminate service challenges as they arise. We continue to work collaboratively to solve for and on behalf of our customers a clear differentiation in the market. We believe Intermodal presents a strong value proposition to customers with significantly improved rail service at a discount to truck pricing, all while cutting carbon emissions on a load by 60% compared to the truck alternative. As such, we see an enormous amount of freight that we believe should be converted from truck to intermodal. We continue to work closely with the rail providers and are encouraged to see the strong service which contributes to a better overall experience for customers. In closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our intermodal franchise and the opportunities to drive significant growth over many, many years. Our customers trust us, believe in our product, and want more of it. We have the people, the technology to enable, and the capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are handling today, and are excited to work with customers to meet their growing demand for efficient transportation solutions. That wraps up my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Well, as the quarter went on one thing that intermodal volumes, one of the more positive elements is, we were really growing throughout the network. Certainly imported goods that transload somewhere on the West Coast are a part of that, but we were pleased with growth we were able to see inside our Eastern network as well. So it was really evenly spread. I mean, you might have heard in the prepared comments, we set a single week volume record during the month of September, and that felt really good for our team to see the value of our services and how our customers trust us and are giving us more of their networks. Well, I'll start on the intermodal pricing question. Look, I mean, the reality is, it's both an opportunity and a risk. We don't know. The freight recession has been a real thing. As you know, we've talked about inventory de-stocking, and the role that that played in demand in our industry for several quarters now. And we're confident that that pressure relief during the third quarter. Questions remain about the U.S. economy, what's going to happen to the consumer, what will demand be as we head into 2024? I guess, we don't really know that. Do I think that the quality of our service warrants a good discussion with our customers about our costs? Absolutely. So will there be an attempt? And will we talk about the need that we have and the costs that we're faced with? Absolutely, we will. But we're going to have to wait and see how that plays out. Well, let me start with sort of the exit from Q3 into Q4. I mean, we continue to bring equipment out of storage. None of our equipment has gone back into storage and demand remains really, really strong, just as it was throughout September. So far, here we are. It's October 17th. Things have effectively continued coming out of the back end of September as they were. I think there's been a -- let me just say, there's been a handful of customers that are at least engaged in dialogue around what maybe we're seeing. So it's different than, hey, I'm going to bid your business, I want another rate reduction. There is a sense of I don't want to accidentally run out of capacity in any of my service offerings, so it's at least a dialogue. I don't want that to represent as if they're busy trying to lock up capacity right now. I mean, I do think customers would love to lock in low prices and that's where -- back to my earlier comments, where we've earned the right to have a conversation about cost challenges we have. And I think that that's been at least understood. Not telling anybody's agreeing to anything. There's just still a lot of questions out there. I think we're taking share both from the highway and from other intermodal channels. I've been really proud of the team's focus and efforts on the highway conversion front, but inevitably there have been pricing actions by our customers earlier in the year, and maybe we didn't win something, and three months later, they come back, and through a mini bid, we win it a second time because maybe a provider struggled to service that opportunity. And that's not new. That happens every year, but that has certainly been something at play here this summer. Well, so I've said this multiple times. Volume is maybe a little bit more valuable to our margin today than it ever has been because of the amount of capacity we've had underutilized. So yes, volume is one of the key components. But volume proportionally doesn't move the margin needle near as fast as price does. The harsh reality is, we need both of those elements. Pricing has long been a lagging indicator. And here you are at the end of Q3 and you can see the results from more or less a fully implemented recent bid cycle, and now we're going to go into a new one. And so you don't get to see the full results of that, probably until next summer, the end of Q3. Meanwhile, we'll be looking to grow and unlock benefits there. But there is no magic recipe here. We need both of those elements and that's why we're so focused on delivering excellent service so that we can generate the value for our customers that translates into an appropriate return on our investments."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I would like to take a minute to highlight and reinforce some of the key tenets around how we manage the company. While the challenges in the freight cycle are well known and documented, and as a result, there is no need to rehash here,. I will again remind you about our long-term approach to the business. Our focus is on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see long-term opportunity to compound returns. We participate in an industry with a large, addressable market that is cyclical. Remaining disciplined around our investments with a long-term focus on our people, technology that enables and capacity to deliver for and on behalf of our customers will support and drive long-term growth for the company and our shareholders. In March of 2022, we announced a joint initiative with BNSF to substantially improve intermodal capacity and service for our customers. We recently announced and closed the acquisition of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics. These are key examples of how our companies are working together to best align efficient and value added solutions for our customers. While the brokerage market is challenged, we see lots of opportunities to drive efficiency in the supply chain with our people, powered and enabled by our technology, our J.B. Hunt 360 platform. We continue to work closely with BNSF and all of our rail service providers to strengthen and create a more reliable intermodal product. And I am pleased to see the progress in our intermodal segment relative to the market in our results. Dedicated and final mile continue to show resiliency in this environment, proving again that our premium service products can be differentiated from the competition. Our J.B. Hunt 360 box product in our truckload segment continues to experience growth, providing an asset light solution, while also leveraging our investments in technology to efficiently serve customers. In closing, we have a tremendous team here at J.B. Hunt with a lot of experience. We will remain disciplined on costs and investments to best prepare the company to serve the growing needs of our customers. We will remain focused on earning appropriate returns on capital and driving efficiency in the supply chain to drive greater value for our customers. I remain confident in the future growth of the company. Now, I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Well, I'll start, Chris, just with -- we're not satisfied with our margin. We did have cost pressures in the quarter, certainly fuel is a component of that. And the way I would describe the ability to launch some growth, our growth doesn't always come neatly packaged. We moved a lot of empties to onboard new business. Our coiled spring is what enabled us to onboard new business quickly. We're very confident in the product we're offering. We're confident in the service we're offering. And as the next bit cycle comes around, we're willing to talk to our customers about our cost challenges. Do we think volume can unlock efficiency? Absolutely. But as you're ramping up rapidly there will be some cost elements that creep in there that we're going to have to battle. And secondly, we more fully implemented the pricing cycle and as expected our price was down in the quarter and that was part of the margin headwind. Well, I don't -- Allison, I don't know how to give you a firm guidance on how quickly it'll come on board. We're engaged with our customers every day looking for ways to save them money. And one of the primary ways we do that is convert highway business to intermodal. We're looking to create better balance where we can with onboarding new business that supports our network and those will be our focus areas in terms of how quickly it comes on. I guess that gets determined by how quick our customers grow and how the overall market reflects on us. I'm confident in the service product we're offering. That's what we can control right now and so that's what we're focused on. Well, I think when you phrase it like that, it really all depends on what happens with our customer's volume. But if everything were to remain equal and we can onboard more volume and there's no violent recession we're faced with, then yeah, it can be the bottom. But there's so many external factors that are going to influence that. Well, Amit, thanks. I think the tough part about a volume conversation is, our customers haven't been very accurate with their forecast or their ability to predict what their needs are. What they are confident in, and our confidence remains high on is that, when they do have a need, we're a go-to provider for them. And we continue to grow confidence out of our customers in our execution ability, our capacity, our willingness to start up new business quickly. And so, our approach to that will continue to be the same. Our customers are under cost pressure. And one of the ways they can save money is convert their highway business back to intermodal. And so, we're going to be very focused on our ability to grow there. I also can't help but -- I mean, we're winning share in the market. Any kind of growth to the West coast will be a benefit for us. I also think the last 12 months have been so confusing based on the way our customers managed inventory. It's really, I don't think anything has been predictable. And so, we're very confident in the product we're offering. We're confident that we're going to be there for our customers and we're going to continue to offer a product that they want to use and that's what we can control. Now, I think you asked the question, Brian, about expectations and whether or not shippers would have another bite of the apple. I just -- I think Darren sort of already addressed, it's too soon to comment on what pricing expectations will look like next year... Where do you want to start, Brad? I think from a carrier community, we are seeing the pressure kind of show itself with reductions or some losses and closures. But I also feel like that difficult backdrop of the brokerage environment and what -- when I mentioned that, they're pushing back on the lowering cost of PTE to kind of come in line with what customer rates have done. And so, to me that's the signal that says they're at that breaking point. And so, while it hasn't been in high volume yet, we do anticipate that we will continue to see an increase in losses or closures as we move forward deeper into 2023, into 2024, as long as this rate environment persists. And so, we have seen that continue to gain momentum, not at macro scale yet, but I think that that's just a matter of time. There's only so long that the carriers can hang on with the low rates. Thank you, Shelley. Very well said. I continue to land on your idea here that this recovery is not an if question at all. It's a win question. I really appreciate and respect the callers need more on the win. We wish we could give you more. The compliance data definitely tells us that we're all working towards a better understanding, but the data and the results in the quarter tell us that there's a lot of headwind out there. But I think we continue to find our way back to this idea of people and experience. And the people on this leadership team have an absolute ton of experience. And that gives us confidence to not feel like we have to make short-term decisions when we know what the right long-term decisions are. For instance, When we talk about our container ads, we use very large micro numbers, but I want to emphasize that was a very, very precise calculation made with the railroads on, real capacity, real availability, real conversion opportunity. We didn't just make up a number there. And when we don't see that demand, we look at and we alter the timing. But what Shelley said is so vitally important. When we were asked questions about just today, the volume in Intermodal. What drove the volume down in Intermodal was PSR, very, very simply. And we reacted to that by completely shutting down our desire to continue to bring on equipment that is extraordinarily hard to source and takes a very long time to get landed. That's experience working right there for you. Saying, hey, we did the calculation, we did the math. These assets have an extraordinarily long life. They sit quietly. We're not out stockpiling Class 8 tractors. We're buying the right assets. When I ask myself, how can we best position the company for the win, for the win we recover? We have to invest in the right assets and we have to learn from our experiences and when we apply that, it's just preparation for the win. I totally appreciate what the folks on this call do, but when you're here with us in this room, we're looking at that long term. So much real good conversation on CapEx and it is elevated and that is a very serious matter, but I want to reiterate the drivers behind that were a shortage of supply. We don't really talk about the impact that shortage of supply has on our system, but when we carry equipment over its natural life, you have to carry extra, you have to fix it more, you have to park it more. We're looking at that with our OEMs saying, wait a second, let's think this through like we're thinking through container management. And those are all capital events. I am, like Shelly, really pleased with the progress in final mile. I think that's an important business for us and I know there's a lot of pressure on it. I'm thankful for the discipline that I see in the businesses when we're under so much volume pressure to have the experience to know that holding on to bad deals is not going to turn out right in the long run. We have tried those exercises. They don't really work for us. We have such great visibility into every aspect of the company. Every single fleet in DCS has its own standalone P&L. We know top to bottom what's happening in there. And categorically, if you go around the businesses, we know where we have the problems and we just aren't tolerant to sit. And if someone else was to do it at those margins, then that's fine with us. We'll be ready when the right business comes along. But finally, I'd just say that Shelley is exactly right. The most important asset we have are the 35,000 people that work here. And the investments that we'll make in them, in the technology and in the capacity that will take us where we're going are well in place, well supported, and are underpinned by something that I wrote down that Shelley said that I, it's one of my new favorite phrases, but you can remain prudent with short-term costs while maintaining a long-term focus. With that, we thank you for calling in today. Talk to you in a quarter."

Similar to last quarter, I'll touch on a few items and reemphasize some key aspects about how we approach and manage the business. As usual, we have key members of our leadership team here to discuss specific areas of each segment. We've noted for several quarters now the shifting dynamics in the industry, and we see, in part, the product for that shift in our results for the second quarter. That said, we remain pleased with the collective and complementary nature of our business mix, some of which is revealed in our current results. For example, we see expected resiliency in certain areas of the business like DCS, areas with meaningful and unique growth opportunities to capitalize on in our Intermodal business, areas with notable improvement in performance in Final Mile, and areas of investment with a large addressable market and growing demand in our brokerage and power-only 360box offering in Highway Services. We maintain our perspective that all segments present meaningful growth opportunities looking forward. As you've heard us say consistently and for quite some time now, we remain committed to our investments in managing the business for the long term. The investments span across our company foundations, including our people, our technology and our capacity. We have a large addressable market and meaningful opportunity to provide unparalleled service and value to our customers across our complementary portfolio. We remain in pursuit of being better prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while staying disciplined on our cost and relying on our vast experience in the business and together here at J.B. Hunt. In closing, I remain confident in this leadership team. Our return-on-investment-focused approach for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders and our ability to differentiate ourselves in the market. Now, I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I wanted to provide an update on some areas of focus for our organization and how they align with the priorities for 2023 that I've previously shared, which are to: one, remain committed to discipline long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As John mentioned, we remain committed to our investments around our company foundation: people, technology, and capacity. As I've stated before, our people intentionally come first. We believe in creating and providing a work environment where our people feel welcomed, valued, respected, safe, and heard. When we take care of our people, who are empowered and trained to take care of our customers, we create raving fans for our services which in turn supports our growth ambitions. We support this growth with investments in our technology and in our capacity, mainly trucks and trailing equipment. Importantly, our investments in technology and capacity are highly focused on efficiency, productivity, and safety. By remaining committed to our investments, we are prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers with our valued service offering. We have to be able to provide exceptional value to our customers at a competitive price that supports reinvestment in our business. As stated on the last two earnings calls that we are in a freight recession. While the environment remains uncertain, and demand for capacity is still muted, we remain very focused on how we grow with our customers, and we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. We will do this by prudently managing our business in the near term focusing on controllable costs. We will also continue to focus on our resource and people needs and make sure we are appropriately aligned and cost competitive to support our ability to serve and grow with our customers. We remain committed to putting the company in a better position to accelerate growth and market share gains for the eventual inflection in market dynamics. We will continue to manage and balance this approach as we progress. In closing, by remaining committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity, which supports our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to touch on three topics with my remarks, including a high-level review of the quarter, an update on our capital plan, and a quick comment on our balance sheet. Starting on second quarter results. Overall freight demand was muted versus the prior year and also below normal seasonal patterns as compared to the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 18% year-over-year, operating income declined 23%, and diluted earnings per share decreased 25%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight and volumes and pricing trends and inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs, and parts and maintenance related expenses. We continue to manage and invest in the business with a long-term mindset, while also being prudent where we can on costs and expenditures. As it relates to our capital plan for the year, we expect net expenditures to fall within the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which brings down the high end of our range, which was previously $2 billion. Some of this is timing related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense in the current environment. Finally, I wanted to briefly touch on the balance sheet. At quarter-end, we had $296 million of cash on the balance sheet. We elected to draw funds available to us under the new credit facility we put in place last September before the term portion of the commitments would expire. As a result, you will see a corresponding higher debt balance, but our net debt level is about $40 million lower versus the prior quarter. This was done to maintain flexibility and maximize our liquidity. In terms of our other priorities, we have no immediate need for this liquidity other than reinvesting in our business, which is always our top priority for capital. Other priorities include supporting our dividend, maintaining investment-grade credit rating and opportunistically repurchasing shares. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 315,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on Dedicated and Final Mile segments, and I want to also give you an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. I am pleased with the performance of our Dedicated business in the quarter and in particular with the resiliency of our model. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions has moderated some, but remains strong as evidenced by our pipeline and our ability to sell new deals. In the quarter, we sold approximately [370] (ph) trucks worth of new deals and a nice acceleration from the 200 we sold in the first quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic on our ability to hit our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year. Circling back to the resiliency of our model and, as a reminder, our Dedicated contracts typically average five years with annual price escalators linked to inflation-based indices with fixed and variable components to the payment terms among other features. Said differently, we do not have exposure to spot rates. We believe we are differentiated in the market by focusing on our proprietary customer value delivery, or CVD, process to drive value for our customers, which ultimately supports our 98% customer retention rate. Now, on to Final Mile. As we have discussed for several quarters now, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture, and exercise equipment, being delivered into the home is seeing some pressure. We see this in our volume, but also overall our pipeline and bid activity. That said, and as we previously shared, we remain committed to providing a differentiated premium service product in the market while making sure we are appropriately compensated for it. We are seeing evidence of market share gains as customers value our service product backed by our brand. We have also discussed our focus on improving profitability and I'm pleased to see and share some of the progress as evidenced this quarter. I'll close with some comments on safety and our equipment. As both Shelley and John alluded to earlier, we are focused on controlling our costs where we can. Our focus on safety for our employees and the motoring public also aligns with our focus on cost. Last quarter, we discussed another major milestone in our safety journey with the rollout of inward-facing cameras. We are pleased with the rollout thus far and what opportunities have been presented to coach and correct certain actions, but also importantly to reward and, in some cases, exonerate drivers from fault. We expect to have inward-facing cameras rolled out to 60% of our fleet by year-end. Finally, on equipment. We have made faster progress than expected on renewing our fleet following some of the disruptions OEMs experienced due to pandemic. Our average age of our equipment continues to improve, which will help on fuel efficiency, safety and reducing maintenance-related expenses. We expect to be fully caught up with our tractor replacement needs by the end of the third quarter. That concludes my remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thanks everyone for joining us. I plan to review the performance of our Intermodal business and give an update on the market, our service performance, and the opportunity we have to deliver value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity remained tempered, driven primarily by lower overall activity because of the inventory destocking cycle and the resulting declines in import activity. Volumes in the quarter declined 7% year-over-year, and by month were down 9% in April, down 8% in May, and down 4% in June. While we are hesitant to suggest the presence of any green shoots, we saw evidence from customers in June that the destocking trend has moderated. We experienced some pressure on margins in the quarter, largely related to the lack of volume and our inability to leverage our cost structure that is in the process of being built to handle significantly more volume. Volume growth is needed to drive down our unit cost as a broader portion of our portfolio was repriced this quarter. With regards to the market environment, but specifically to bid season wrapping up here in the near term, overall pricing for domestic Intermodal service fell within the range of our expectations as we entered the year, but our overall portfolio trended towards the lower end of those expectations as the bid season progressed. As it stands today, Intermodal continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with vastly improved service at a discount versus the truck alternative at least in line with historical averages, all while cutting the carbon emissions on a load of freight on average by 60% versus the haul truck alternative. We continue to see an enormous amount of freight to convert from Highway to Intermodal and have been working very closely with our primary rail providers to build resiliency in our networks, capacity and a comprehensive service offering to capitalize on the opportunity. As it relates to the overall service from our rail providers, I am encouraged by the trends we are seeing in velocity and on-time service quality, but more importantly, the commitments to collectively work towards an even better overall experience and value proposition for customers. We have stressed the importance of sustaining service through a volume recovery and that's where our joint focus is today. We'd like our position and feel confident in our rail provider's ability to handle more volume as recovery ensues. We believe we are in a unique position with our rail providers to accelerate growth for the domestic intermodal market by providing a differentiated service and value proposition for our customers. In closing, I want to make sure I reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity. As I stated last quarter and what has probably become more evident this quarter, we have a network built and resources available to handle significantly more volume than we are executing today. We remain in a coiled spring status better prepared to meet the future needs of our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. So, I'll turn it over Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and our Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, similar to some of the prior comments, overall demand in truckload brokerage was muted versus the prior-year period and what would be expected from a seasonal perspective coming out of Q1. Top-line revenue for the segment was down 43%, driven by volume down 26% and revenue per load down 24%. Overall, our contractual business is holding up better versus our spot business on the volume front as our contractual business was up double digits year-over-year. This highlights the competitiveness in the market, particularly on the spot business, but also how much activity has declined in the spot market year-over-year. Notably, there seem to be some firming or at least a bottoming out on spot rates towards the end of the quarter and we saw that reflected in our gross margin. Wrapping up on ICS, we remain committed to our long-term investments in this area around our J.B. Hunt 360 technology, our capacity, which in this instance is third-party carriers, and our people. We recognize we have too many resources for the level of activity currently in the system and we'll continue to work to make adjustments to our model to set us up better to adapt to the swings in the market moving forward. Now moving to Truckload. As you recall, we moved almost all of our company tractor assets or trucks out of this segment over to Dedicated with our last quarterly report. Remaining is our drop trailer or 360box service offering served primarily by third-party carriers or independent contractors. These non-company-owned asset providers source available drop trailer loads on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, driving efficiency in the supply chain for our customers and for their own operations. We continue to be pleased and encouraged by the relative strength of our drop trailer demand as customers appreciate the value and flexibility it provides for their operations. Wrapping up on JBT, we are still relatively young in the development of our 360box service offering and continue to make investments to strengthen the product and drive greater efficiencies. We remain encouraged by the market's growing demand for our 360box service and will remain committed to our investments to drive long-term growth in this area. Wrapping up quickly on 360, we remain focused on ways to maximize value for our customers and the carrier community. The level of engagement and interaction in the platform informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident on our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments. As is always the case, we will remain disciplined with our investments focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good evening. Just going back to the modal share shift comment that you made in Intermodal, is there a way to better understand? I mean, are you seeing that today? Obviously, there's a discounted truck still with Intermodal in terms of pricing. Rail service is getting better. Is that starting to accelerate in terms of that shift, or is that something that you still see as an opportunity later on? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Thanks, Allison. When we commented on a tremendous amount of loads that Intermodal can and should be the correct solution for, we've seen that for many, many years. I don't know that it's any more pronounced in the current environment than it's been for the last decade. The reality is we want to develop a better service product and better service experience for our customers with more predictability, and we're working every day today with our rail providers in order to achieve that. That will continue to be our focus as we move forward, and we know that the last, I'm going to call it, five years of rail service has been difficult. However, in today's environment, we're seeing significant improvements, and we're seeing significant commitments, including investments by our rail providers, to help us in this area.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. It's Ken Hoexter. I guess, Darren, you seemed a little hesitant to talk about green shoots, yet you noted you moved from down 8% to down 4% May to June. Maybe talk a little bit about that and your thoughts on discussions with shippers into peak season. How are shippers thinking about that and prepping you for volumes as you look forward?\nDarren Field: Well, coming into the year, we relied heavily on customer forecasts, and they were largely all wrong. And today, we're still a little cautious on what we expect as the year goes on. We will for all -- forever rely on feedback from our customers as we work together to provide capacity and grow solutions for them. So, I don't want anybody to hear green shoots. What I would say is last year Q2 was the strongest volume year. And as we move forward, the comps get easier, frankly, and that's an element as we move forward. But we know that we have the capacity and our customers are confident in what we do. They want to grow with us when their demand returns, and we'll be ready for that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Afternoon. I know you guys don't give specific margin targets around Intermodal, but I am curious given it was somewhat or a little bit below sort of your long-run target range, what does it take to return you to that 10% to 12% range? Is it simply loads and leveraging that, or is there other things that need to happen? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, we were carrying extra cost in -- so far this year as we have extra equipment. We're not utilizing. We certainly took driver wages up a year ago. Those wages are certainly going to stay elevated and yet the market has challenged us with pricing and prices are negative. At this point, we really need more volume to unlock cost takeout from our system and improve the utilization of both our container fleet as well as our drayage fleet and then just the employee base supporting our business, all of which would give us an improvement in our margin profile.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about Dedicated. That was clearly a source of resiliency and strength in the quarter despite the freight market weakness we've seen. But I wanted to get your expectations for that business over the remainder of the year. When you combine some of the fleet attrition you're seeing with new Dedicated sales, do you think the fleet can remain pretty consistent with the level we saw in the second quarter? And from a margin perspective, is there still room for sequential improvement versus what we just saw in the second quarter?\nBrad Hicks: Yeah, I'll talk more about truck count and what we see there. Our pipeline, I would say, is still full. We feel very good about our pipeline. There's a lot of different fleets in there. And so, we really like what we've seen. Our hit rate or close rate is ticked up just slightly. And so, we like where we're going there. So, we feel good about Dedicated. Going to be close to about where the fleet size is end of the year. We still got some other trucks to take out from our maintenance and clean up. As I said, we'll be primarily done with that at the end of Q3 with the extra truck and older trucks. So, we'll see some help there on our truck count, but we'll have some deals that will start out there in the year. But I would just say it's kind of very consistent throughout the year on the sales pipeline. I know we closed a few more trucks in Q2, but the demand does seem to be there, but still people are a little reluctant to pull the trigger the way they had previously.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, if I can go back to you on the pricing and the bid season. Brad Hicks said that you're starting to see some firming or bottoming out of spot pricing as it relates to ICS. You talked about the destocking maybe coming to an end. When we think about the pricing discussions you had in the bid process in March and April, where there was just a lot of, I think, fear in the market versus where we are now in mid-July, has anything gotten any better as those conversations go as trucking gets a little bit better as rail service gets a little bit better?\nDarren Field: Well, that would constitute probably given a little bit of more direction on price than I really think we can. What I would say is our customers have asked for a better service, more consistent service product from us. We're working on providing that. I think that Intermodal has to provide the correct balance of value in the economics as well as the service quality. And that's why we're focused in those two areas. As we move forward, I think the discussions we've had with our customers are around how together can we take cost out to find advantages in pricing. And then, the Intermodal price will always lag the Truckload market. It's never quite as severe. And, certainly, the spot market in truck is a pretty small influencer on the Intermodal pricing overall. Contract drop trailer pricing plays a little bit more of a role in terms of our economics and the influence it might have on our customers purchasing of Intermodal. But I don't know that the spot market influence that we've seen on the Highway side is showing up in any form of dialogue with our customers. It's a data point. It's one of many that we keep an eye on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. I guess, first, just anything to note around the noise around Yellow right now. I know whether it's on the brokerage side or anywhere else, any comments on if you're seeing any shipper response from Yellow? And then, I guess, Darren, I assume bid compliance is still really, really low, 55% or something like that, and you're still stacking, I don't know, 18% of your containers. You guys have the highest variable cost structure in the industry. I was wondering, does there come a point in time because you have so much cost embedded in the system where you're willing to maybe take that price even lower to drive more volume? Just your thoughts around that, because it just seems like this could be a great market share opportunity, and you can offset some of the pricing with the variable cost structure and then the cost leverage as well.\nJohn Roberts: Hey, Amit. I'll address the question related to Yellow. One, we're probably not going to comment on that. But based upon the change in certain stock prices today, I guess we wish we were perceived to have some sort of benefit from whatever may be happening in the industry, LTL industry. And then, I'll pass second part of your question over to Darren.\nDarren Field: We have long asked ourselves if you just cut rate, do you just get more volume? And the reality is the two are not as yoked as you would think. You can cut your price and then haul the same amount of loads for a lower price. We spend a lot of time growing experience in our pricing teams, our sales organizations. They work very closely together in our pricing exercise and process is not quite as commodity like the way you described it. Certainly, as the correct opportunity presents itself, and it comes with volume that contributes to our organization at the correct investment level, if those economics we can meet, then we do that. And we look at them one opportunity at a time, always have, always will.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So, Darren, it sounds like you think volume is the key to getting Intermodal margin and earnings higher. It still feels like maybe there's still some downside risk to price. So, which is the bigger lever in the near term? I guess ultimately, I'm trying to figure out, do you think Intermodal margins and earnings keep resetting a bit lower from the second quarter into the third quarter? And then, maybe just separately just longer term question for John. You guys have made a lot of investments in 360 in a tougher market. The business is now -- the brokerage business is back to losing money. Do you think about dialing back some of those investments? Just how you think about that? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Well, Scott, let me start first on margin. Price will always improve our margin faster than volume will. That will be the case for my entire career. I think you've heard us talk about the need for volume to see some improvement because that's the most likely influencer fastest. I don't anticipate any sort of pricing market in the near term that's going to help with our margin as quickly as we might see an opportunity to grow our volume. Meanwhile, when we announced a 150,000 container growth target over what is now more like two to four years, we did that with the mindset of growing our volume at a correct return, and that will continue to be our focus.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah, let me make a comment just overall, then, Brad, I'll ask you to comment on kind of where we are with 360. But in general, I think the vision and strategy here is that while we know we're in some turbulent water, the opportunities that we see to invest in are probably as good as they've ever been in all aspects of the organization. I see certain changes being made lately that are even more encouraging from a capital allocation discipline standpoint. For instance, moving the power out of the JBT business into Dedicated is a step that is very consistent with long-term investment strategy and a perspective that we have such a huge addressable market and such really, really high-quality services and brand and team of people that are so committed that we would just be remiss to slow down. I know it feels a little off timing right now, but I -- even as of this morning, I continue to be super confident in the opportunity and our ability to execute on what is in front of us. And Brad, let me let you hit.\nBrad Hicks: Yeah. I'll just add from a 360 standpoint, we stay in committed to our investment in the platform technology as it relates to all things J.B. Hunt. We don't think about this one window of time that that we find ourselves in, which is probably the most remarkably difficult environment many of us have experienced in our careers. Largely, the investment that we've made in tech is behind us as it relates to the platform, but we will continue to invest to add capabilities and features of value for our customers and for our carriers. And so, we remain committed, Scott, to the idea that the platform drives value for J.B. Hunt. And it's difficult to see in the last 90 days, but there's a lot of things that are really difficult to see in the last 90 days. And I think that we'll be better for it as we come out of what we're in. I think, Shelley said last quarter, it's not a matter of if but when. And we believe that when that happens, we're going to be very well positioned and poised to be able to scale for the growth that our customers bring our way.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Scott, I might add to this. I think one of the things in our company foundations is technology. And when you think about our ability to serve our customers in 2021 and then 2022, we were able to leverage our technology investments to really step up, have a step function change from a growth perspective and delivering more value for our customers. As if you look at two of the tighter years, if you will, 2018, and then again coming into COVID, our technology further enhanced our ability to serve our customers. So, we look at our technology and not just as an investment of what return can we get on the investments that we're making, that is across our entire organization. And we evaluate every idea that comes across from our people from an investment lens. And so, for us, we let our customers give us feedback. They help drive our technology strategy. And then, you see that play out over a longer period of time as the company continues to grow and have long-term compounding returns on behalf of our shareholders. So that's a key part of our strategy. I don't see that changing. But we're always going to be prudent and watch how we spend and what returns we can get over the long term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Darren, I guess just in terms of the details of how much you're through the contracting in Intermodal in the second quarter? I guess, in other words, how much of the business has been repriced in the environment we're in and maybe what's left in the third and fourth quarter to go? And then, as you look at the box count, the growth sequentially was the lowest it's been quite some time going back to when you sort of launched some of the longer-term growth initiatives. How do we think about that going forward? It sounds like in your comments that maybe we could see that be a bit constrained here in near term as sort of the return profile of the growth is maybe not exactly where it needs to be. Is that something that we'll see kind of slow down a little bit more from where we are right now?\nDarren Field: So, on the pricing front, typical calendar year, and I would say this year is no different. We repriced 30% in the first quarter or implement 30% in the first quarter, 30% in the second, 30% in the third, and 10% in the fourth. I guess, the 10% in the fourth quarter would most likely be the next pricing cycle. So, as we get through this quarter, we'll really finish up implementation. I think that just as a general, we had some customers move a little faster this year. So, it's been earlier than what has been the historical norm. So, there's not that much new price left to implement as we move through the third quarter. And as far as the equipment goes, I think John Roberts highlighted it really well. We continue to see this enormous opportunity to grow our business with value to our customers. That being said, we're not going to ignore the fact that we ran into a slower time, and we did back off where we could. I don't want that to represent to our customers, most importantly, any hesitancy to bring on that equipment. We will continue our pipeline of equipment, but we're going to be prudent with our capital. We're going to be prudent with our expenses to the extent we can. And then, we'll speed it up just as fast as we can. There was a time three or four years ago we actually stopped it, and that taught us a big lesson and we don't want to do that unless forced to. But at this point, we believe in our long-term growth opportunity, and we're going to continue to bring on equipment. But we're going to be as smart about that as we can, and I think the quarter showed that we can slow that down at the right time when demand kind of fades for a little bit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Darren, just one quick one for you in terms of the West Coast labor resolution. The ports have come to agreements, still up for ratification. Any change on the margin since that's been done over the last month in terms of the info or at least the interest level coming through that gateway? And then, Shelley, if you can just give us your updated or maybe, Brad, your updated view on Truckload capacity in the market, especially the small carrier? There's a lot been written about the health of the small carrier, but I think you've given some commentary about they're going to run into a bit more of a cash crunch here in the back half of the year. The spot rate is kind of bouncing around the bottom. Hopefully, just wanted to hear your updated thoughts and if you're seeing anything on the platform as well. Thanks.\nDarren Field: So, I'll start on the West Coast. We had a number of customers that highlighted as soon as that contract negotiation was complete, they would consider moving back some of the East Coast imports through the West Coast. We haven't seen. It's not been real visible to us, but we are in dialogue with many of our customers talking about that opportunity. We still feel confident that the West Coast import opportunity for our customers is the fastest lowest cost answer. So, we're confident that we will see a slow move back to the West, not all of it. Some that went to the East will stay in the East, and we serve those markets as well. So, we're certainly glad that the West Coast labor negotiation is behind us at this point, and so, we'll continue to look for some benefits from that as the year moves on.\nBrad Hicks: And then, Brian, from a Truckload capacity -- this is Brad Hicks, we continue to see net revocations be at elevated levels throughout the second quarter. We've commented previously that in past cycles, typically that range where a carrier can hang on is in a 12 to 15 month window, and we would believe that we're in that nineth to 11th month range depending on what you pick as a starting point. We see orders on new tractors down, notwithstanding some carryover for replacements at the peak of COVID. And we're also seeing pressure in the carrier community kind of pushing back on PTE ranges. And so that kind of makes us feel like that that bottom that I made comment to in my prepared remarks has been realized. Now, we don't know what volume is going to do in the back half, and then certainly any lift from here could prove very valuable to us, but certainly not anticipating any normal peak at this point, but we would expect it to pick up from here. But we don't know. If you look at the elevated revenues that carriers were benefiting from in the peak of the pandemic, it's hard to tell how much of that they were able to save that could carry it deeper than maybe some of our historical data represents. And so, still a little bit wait and see, but certainly seeing more indications of closures or losses in the marketplace today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: You've been in this environment where you've been adding gross trucks in Dedicated, but bleeding some out on a same fleet basis just from the cyclical pressures in the market. How far along in that life cycle do you think we are where -- how far are we from a situation where the gross adds can start to look more like the net adds? And just to add some clarity to that comment, how big of a issue is competition from existing private fleets at some of your otherwise Dedicated customers, or is this really more of a cyclical volume response from those customers? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah. Thanks, Bascome. I would just say what we're seeing is there's a lot of pressure on our customers. And I can't answer when the economy is going to turn around, demand is going to pick up. But if things remain slow, they'll continue to put pressure and our CVD process is all about [cranking out] (ph) cost and redesigning routes and optimizing fleets. And so, we'll continue to do that till the volume picks up. Our volume has just been steady, I would say, because we're coming outbound from the DCs and we want to deliver to stores and homes, and so it's been consistent. I can tell you when it's going to turn around, and we'll just continue to drive out cost as our volumes dictate. We've not -- I don't want to misspeak here, but we're not seeing hardly any pressure from our competition. What we're seeing on our existing fleets, we're just seeing cost pressure internally for the most part. And so that's kind of where we're at.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Zazula with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Zazula: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Brad, you had mentioned a little bit of a mismatch in resources relative to the activity you were seeing in your businesses. Can you unpack that and talk about how you're planning on managing that moving forward and how you're setting yourself up for the eventual upturn?\nBrad Hicks: Yeah, David, thanks for the question. We really coming out of Q1. We saw the downward pressure on volumes and we saw that replay itself, if you will, in Q2. So it's really that radical decline. We have reduced headcount, as you can see. And then really what we're focused on is how we can successfully grow back in to the remaining resources that we have more so than continuing to diminish our capability because we know that when this does turn, we want to be ready and prepared for that. And so, spending a lot of time making sure we are ready for that, tightening up where we can. But by and large, I think the vast majority of the right-sizing is behind us at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a couple here. One just to kind of follow-up on that last question on inventory. Is it going to -- are you [hearing] (ph) that shippers are kind of done with destocking but are reluctant to restock on the other side of that kind of given macro conditions? And maybe a second question. Can you just talk a little bit more about power-only? Kind of you referenced in your earlier remarks, but kind of now that we have cycled a fairly severe downcycle in addition to the pandemic upcycle, can we definitively determine what the kind of normalized level of power-only demand is for the industry? And kind of was that a pandemic-only flash in the pan? Or do you think that's a long-term growth story for the industry?\nDarren Field: So, why don't I start with the inventory question. What we -- what I think we recognize is coming into 2022 in the first half, our customers had made significant orders and they had a lot of inventories as sales began to decline. As those sales declined, they were full flushed with inventory, and it took them some time to burn through that. We're not suggesting that we've had any dialogue with any customer that suggests they don't want to maintain some level of inventory that is aligned with their sales. I mean, they're trying to match inventory with their sales. I'm not aware of any customer that wants to miss a sale because they didn't have inventory. Obviously, they don't want to do that. They're just being a little bit more cautious on the ordering process, and I think supply chain actually allows customers to get their orders faster than they were during the pandemic, and all of those factors are playing in a role. But I'm not aware of a single customer that wants to intentionally hold inventory down if that meant at risk their sales.\nBrad Hicks: And I think for part two, I may not have heard the question entirety, but I think the question was around what do we see for the future of our power-only with 360box. What I would just say there is that we continue to have very strong demand. We had double-digit growth in the network again in the second quarter. And so, in spite of the environment that we're in, to have double-digit growth in a truckload capacity, we're very encouraged by that. I do think that we learned a lot about the radical up and the radical down in the last 36 months, and we're hopeful that we can best align our strategy for those types of swings in the future. I'm hoping that we don't have that level of volatility in the future. But in the event that we do, I think that we're poised to take advantage of the critical learnings that we did experience, again, both on the radical up and more so on the radical decline that we've seen over the last six to nine months. But the customer's appreciation of what box can do for them and the value that creates around flexibility in their system has been very welcoming from a customer base standpoint. So, we remain excited about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to focus a little bit on the Intermodal side. Clearly, you mentioned that the comps do get easier and they get a lot easier in September. Should we expect an inflection on the volume side to maybe some positive numbers? And then, how should we think about your length of haul, given the fact that the West Coast port problems have been pushed behind us?\nDarren Field: Well, Jason, that's with the guidance, I think, what all I'd say is we continue to be encouraged by dialogue we have with our customers. We're prepared to grow. We're specifically prepared to grow on the West Coast as imports continue to improve and our economy, we're still waiting to see if there will be any kind of a holiday shipping season. Not a lot of predictions around that, but we'll have to wait and see. And I would -- the mix was a factor in the first quarter. We talked some about that, and you could see it just in the results of growth. As we move forward, it just depends on what our customers doing, what their sales are like, and unfortunately, I can't really answer your question as we're all waiting to find out the same answer to that question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in here. Darren, can you give us a sequential monthly look at how sort of RPUs ex fuel are trending in the quarter? And then I'm just trying to understand if we exit sort of 2Q at whatever the exit rate is, what would that look like in terms of a year-over-year decline for 3Q?\nDarren Field: So, we've been giving -- during the pandemic, we started providing the monthly volume change year-over-year, that's really all we're going to do in the monthly sequential view there, and anything moving forward is guidance that I just really can't provide.\nDavid Vernon: Well, I mean, it's more of a question about the [indiscernible] guidance.\nJohn Roberts: Well, David, let me answer it this way. I mean, Darren provided information about the cadence of how contracts were implemented over the course of a year. As we enter Q3, a larger portion of our book of business will effectively be repriced. And so, as the year progresses, more and more of our overall portfolio or book of business is repriced at rates that are more commensurate to the environment we're in. And so it seems like that should give you an answer or at least some color to provide you direction of what you're trying to get at.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered. Darren, if I could just throw this out, thank you for the monthly breakdown of carload progression during the quarter. I wanted to take a look at the East versus the West, because the growth rate in the East pulled back from kind of positive 1% last quarter to down 6%. In the West, it was relatively stable, even a little bit better, and I know I'm talking year-on-year comps. You said the West Coast volume hadn't come on yet. Can you talk about what went on in the East? Was a lot of this related to the rail conjunctions related to accidents in Ohio? Was there some kind of shift in that eastern Intermodal market? Could you give us a little more color on that?\nDarren Field: Well, I don't think volumes in the East in the quarter were significantly impacted by anything in Ohio. That [indiscernible] occurred back in, I think, early February if I'm not right if -- I don't recall the exact date. But certainly, the eastern network volumes in the first quarter were encouraging. They remain encouraging. I think a year ago, we had a lot of strength in our eastern network business. And we continue to present pricing and service solutions to our customers in those markets. I would also say that the Highway price is more competitive in the East than it is in the West, and so that plays a slightly more significant role in our eastern network. And I think that as the quarter went on, we really saw enormous improvement in our service performance from our well providers. And that wasn't the case necessarily in the first quarter, but we really experienced a lot of excellent service during the second quarter and we've got a let that play out and work with our customers so that they can see the quality of service and continue to give us an opportunity to grow as the year goes on.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity for the question here. One clarification for Darren. I know you've talked a lot about volume, but think earlier in the call, you said something about easier comps being a factor. Is that the primary reason the year-over-year was better in June or did you actually see a little bit of ad loop pickup that might be better than seasonality? And then, maybe one just for John or Shelley. I know the crystal balls aren't that clear, but it seems like the last couple of cycles, we have seen greater volatility and bigger moves up in rate and capacity and bigger moves down. Do you think that pattern is going to continue? I don't know if that's market structure driven, if that's technology driven. But do you think when we look forward, maybe we'd see another potentially bigger move up in price as we saw in 2018 and over the last couple of years? So, anyways, thanks for the thoughts.\nDarren Field: So first of all, on the comp period, I didn't intend for it to sound like June was an easier comp. June was actually our most difficult comparison month from '22. So, certainly, June had some positive signs in it. Again, we're still in a wait-and-see mode for the rest of the year.\nJohn Roberts: And maybe just for the benefit of everyone on the call, Darren provided the monthly down 9, down 8, down 4 as the quarter progressed. In the prior-year period, April comp was plus 4, May was plus 9, and June was plus 10. So June was our toughest comp in the quarter.\nShelley Simpson: Yeah. I might just say you've heard Darren make lots of comments around what's happening between he and Brad from a cycle perspective. I think it's difficult for us to say what's going to happen from a price perspective coming into this next bid season. I will say the majority of our pricing has been completed on the transactional side. Certainly, Dedicated doesn't have that impact as they're in longer-term agreements, and a majority of their business into some kind of industry from a price discussion. So I couldn't really say that, but I will say, certainly, cost to operate are higher, this go around than it would have been in 2018 or even going through the pandemic, inflation is across the board. And so I think that's why you heard Brad make comments around what's happening from carriers and price in general. I will say, although our second quarter, you did see the continued pressure from a freight recession, there were a lot of great things that happened, and we're really proud of the work. I want to make sure that I call out the strength and resiliency across our complementary business model, in particular, I believe Brad said Dedicated showed strong results and had a record in the quarter for operating income. I think that's important especially considering where we're at. But I also might make notice of Final Mile, who also continued improvement in profitability as they continue to work with customers and making sure we were paid appropriately for the hard work that we do and the value we create for them. We are encouraged with growth opportunities that we do see continuing in both our brokerage and power-only 360box offerings and Highway Services, and we're going to leverage our technology to continue to deliver on behalf of our customers. And we do think our Intermodal business is outperforming the industry. We continue to have meaningful and unique growth opportunities to capitalize on that ahead, and that's how we're going to focus moving into the second half of the year. You've heard us talk a lot about our growth and growth prospects, it isn't a matter of if but when. We will remain committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity and make sure that we're paid appropriately while understanding where we are in the short term. We will stay focused with our people because that's who delivers the great value for our customers. There are over 35,000 of us working hard every day, in particular, drivers on the road, and they're going to make sure we do a great job on behalf of our customers. And finally, that will drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. So, there's still something Darren said and take it out of Intermodal and take it into the organization because we are in a position that we know it's not a matter of if but when we are in a cold spring position on behalf of our customers across our entire organization. With that, I'll turn it over to John for closing remarks.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Shelley. Great thoughts there. I've noted, as we discussed here, as we usually do in this call, we spend most of our time on the kind of current state, near term, appropriately. That's what you need to help continue to evaluate what you see here. I want to mention that we do manage and run our segments with intense focus on detail. It's one of the qualities that I think can set us apart when we do it right. And that's a daily, weekly, monthly evaluation of the critical elements of the business. And so when we look at the macro, when we talk about big compliance and other elements that are vital, it's also important to know that it's a very almost surgical approach that we take. I think we see short-term focused decisions yielding short-term results. And, accordingly, we just are more focused on positioning for that future opportunity than dealing with the current conditions, knowing that that future opportunity will need us to be ready. It does remain a when, not if question. And I can tell you that while I appreciate our composure on our long-term vision, we have great from a real-time work and focus under Shelley's leadership on the current issues that we face because of the freight recession that we're in. And so, I just want to emphasize, our focus here is on our customers, enriching our people's ability to serve our customers, and we are thinking of ourselves as a coiled spring. It's a great analogy, and I'm very, very pleased with the work so far. And we look forward to a great future and calls that we'll be able to give you updates also. So, appreciate you joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of Integrated Capacity Solutions and our Truckload segments, what we collectively call Highway Services. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, similar to some of the prior comments, overall demand in truckload brokerage was muted versus the prior-year period and what would be expected from a seasonal perspective coming out of Q1. Top-line revenue for the segment was down 43%, driven by volume down 26% and revenue per load down 24%. Overall, our contractual business is holding up better versus our spot business on the volume front as our contractual business was up double digits year-over-year. This highlights the competitiveness in the market, particularly on the spot business, but also how much activity has declined in the spot market year-over-year. Notably, there seem to be some firming or at least a bottoming out on spot rates towards the end of the quarter and we saw that reflected in our gross margin. Wrapping up on ICS, we remain committed to our long-term investments in this area around our J.B. Hunt 360 technology, our capacity, which in this instance is third-party carriers, and our people. We recognize we have too many resources for the level of activity currently in the system and we'll continue to work to make adjustments to our model to set us up better to adapt to the swings in the market moving forward. Now moving to Truckload. As you recall, we moved almost all of our company tractor assets or trucks out of this segment over to Dedicated with our last quarterly report. Remaining is our drop trailer or 360box service offering served primarily by third-party carriers or independent contractors. These non-company-owned asset providers source available drop trailer loads on our J.B. Hunt 360 platform, driving efficiency in the supply chain for our customers and for their own operations. We continue to be pleased and encouraged by the relative strength of our drop trailer demand as customers appreciate the value and flexibility it provides for their operations. Wrapping up on JBT, we are still relatively young in the development of our 360box service offering and continue to make investments to strengthen the product and drive greater efficiencies. We remain encouraged by the market's growing demand for our 360box service and will remain committed to our investments to drive long-term growth in this area. Wrapping up quickly on 360, we remain focused on ways to maximize value for our customers and the carrier community. The level of engagement and interaction in the platform informs us about the market and provides a solid foundation to drive productivity in our operations across the organization and eliminate waste in the overall supply chain. While some of the productivity is masked by the current environment, we remain confident on our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and our company with our investments. As is always the case, we will remain disciplined with our investments focused on driving long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A portion of the call. Yeah, I'll talk more about truck count and what we see there. Our pipeline, I would say, is still full. We feel very good about our pipeline. There's a lot of different fleets in there. And so, we really like what we've seen. Our hit rate or close rate is ticked up just slightly. And so, we like where we're going there. So, we feel good about Dedicated. Going to be close to about where the fleet size is end of the year. We still got some other trucks to take out from our maintenance and clean up. As I said, we'll be primarily done with that at the end of Q3 with the extra truck and older trucks. So, we'll see some help there on our truck count, but we'll have some deals that will start out there in the year. But I would just say it's kind of very consistent throughout the year on the sales pipeline. I know we closed a few more trucks in Q2, but the demand does seem to be there, but still people are a little reluctant to pull the trigger the way they had previously. Yeah. I'll just add from a 360 standpoint, we stay in committed to our investment in the platform technology as it relates to all things J.B. Hunt. We don't think about this one window of time that that we find ourselves in, which is probably the most remarkably difficult environment many of us have experienced in our careers. Largely, the investment that we've made in tech is behind us as it relates to the platform, but we will continue to invest to add capabilities and features of value for our customers and for our carriers. And so, we remain committed, Scott, to the idea that the platform drives value for J.B. Hunt. And it's difficult to see in the last 90 days, but there's a lot of things that are really difficult to see in the last 90 days. And I think that we'll be better for it as we come out of what we're in. I think, Shelley said last quarter, it's not a matter of if but when. And we believe that when that happens, we're going to be very well positioned and poised to be able to scale for the growth that our customers bring our way. And then, Brian, from a Truckload capacity -- this is Brad Hicks, we continue to see net revocations be at elevated levels throughout the second quarter. We've commented previously that in past cycles, typically that range where a carrier can hang on is in a 12 to 15 month window, and we would believe that we're in that nineth to 11th month range depending on what you pick as a starting point. We see orders on new tractors down, notwithstanding some carryover for replacements at the peak of COVID. And we're also seeing pressure in the carrier community kind of pushing back on PTE ranges. And so that kind of makes us feel like that that bottom that I made comment to in my prepared remarks has been realized. Now, we don't know what volume is going to do in the back half, and then certainly any lift from here could prove very valuable to us, but certainly not anticipating any normal peak at this point, but we would expect it to pick up from here. But we don't know. If you look at the elevated revenues that carriers were benefiting from in the peak of the pandemic, it's hard to tell how much of that they were able to save that could carry it deeper than maybe some of our historical data represents. And so, still a little bit wait and see, but certainly seeing more indications of closures or losses in the marketplace today. Yeah, David, thanks for the question. We really coming out of Q1. We saw the downward pressure on volumes and we saw that replay itself, if you will, in Q2. So it's really that radical decline. We have reduced headcount, as you can see. And then really what we're focused on is how we can successfully grow back in to the remaining resources that we have more so than continuing to diminish our capability because we know that when this does turn, we want to be ready and prepared for that. And so, spending a lot of time making sure we are ready for that, tightening up where we can. But by and large, I think the vast majority of the right-sizing is behind us at this point. And I think for part two, I may not have heard the question entirety, but I think the question was around what do we see for the future of our power-only with 360box. What I would just say there is that we continue to have very strong demand. We had double-digit growth in the network again in the second quarter. And so, in spite of the environment that we're in, to have double-digit growth in a truckload capacity, we're very encouraged by that. I do think that we learned a lot about the radical up and the radical down in the last 36 months, and we're hopeful that we can best align our strategy for those types of swings in the future. I'm hoping that we don't have that level of volatility in the future. But in the event that we do, I think that we're poised to take advantage of the critical learnings that we did experience, again, both on the radical up and more so on the radical decline that we've seen over the last six to nine months. But the customer's appreciation of what box can do for them and the value that creates around flexibility in their system has been very welcoming from a customer base standpoint. So, we remain excited about that."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to touch on three topics with my remarks, including a high-level review of the quarter, an update on our capital plan, and a quick comment on our balance sheet. Starting on second quarter results. Overall freight demand was muted versus the prior year and also below normal seasonal patterns as compared to the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 18% year-over-year, operating income declined 23%, and diluted earnings per share decreased 25%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight and volumes and pricing trends and inflationary cost pressures, primarily in the areas of salaries and wages, capital costs, and parts and maintenance related expenses. We continue to manage and invest in the business with a long-term mindset, while also being prudent where we can on costs and expenditures. As it relates to our capital plan for the year, we expect net expenditures to fall within the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which brings down the high end of our range, which was previously $2 billion. Some of this is timing related, but also we are being prudent where it makes sense in the current environment. Finally, I wanted to briefly touch on the balance sheet. At quarter-end, we had $296 million of cash on the balance sheet. We elected to draw funds available to us under the new credit facility we put in place last September before the term portion of the commitments would expire. As a result, you will see a corresponding higher debt balance, but our net debt level is about $40 million lower versus the prior quarter. This was done to maintain flexibility and maximize our liquidity. In terms of our other priorities, we have no immediate need for this liquidity other than reinvesting in our business, which is always our top priority for capital. Other priorities include supporting our dividend, maintaining investment-grade credit rating and opportunistically repurchasing shares. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 315,000 shares and will remain active as opportunities present themselves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on Dedicated and Final Mile segments, and I want to also give you an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. I am pleased with the performance of our Dedicated business in the quarter and in particular with the resiliency of our model. Demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions has moderated some, but remains strong as evidenced by our pipeline and our ability to sell new deals. In the quarter, we sold approximately [370] (ph) trucks worth of new deals and a nice acceleration from the 200 we sold in the first quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic on our ability to hit our gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks for the year. Circling back to the resiliency of our model and, as a reminder, our Dedicated contracts typically average five years with annual price escalators linked to inflation-based indices with fixed and variable components to the payment terms among other features. Said differently, we do not have exposure to spot rates. We believe we are differentiated in the market by focusing on our proprietary customer value delivery, or CVD, process to drive value for our customers, which ultimately supports our 98% customer retention rate. Now, on to Final Mile. As we have discussed for several quarters now, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture, and exercise equipment, being delivered into the home is seeing some pressure. We see this in our volume, but also overall our pipeline and bid activity. That said, and as we previously shared, we remain committed to providing a differentiated premium service product in the market while making sure we are appropriately compensated for it. We are seeing evidence of market share gains as customers value our service product backed by our brand. We have also discussed our focus on improving profitability and I'm pleased to see and share some of the progress as evidenced this quarter. I'll close with some comments on safety and our equipment. As both Shelley and John alluded to earlier, we are focused on controlling our costs where we can. Our focus on safety for our employees and the motoring public also aligns with our focus on cost. Last quarter, we discussed another major milestone in our safety journey with the rollout of inward-facing cameras. We are pleased with the rollout thus far and what opportunities have been presented to coach and correct certain actions, but also importantly to reward and, in some cases, exonerate drivers from fault. We expect to have inward-facing cameras rolled out to 60% of our fleet by year-end. Finally, on equipment. We have made faster progress than expected on renewing our fleet following some of the disruptions OEMs experienced due to pandemic. Our average age of our equipment continues to improve, which will help on fuel efficiency, safety and reducing maintenance-related expenses. We expect to be fully caught up with our tractor replacement needs by the end of the third quarter. That concludes my remarks. So, I'll turn it over to Darren. Yeah. Thanks, Bascome. I would just say what we're seeing is there's a lot of pressure on our customers. And I can't answer when the economy is going to turn around, demand is going to pick up. But if things remain slow, they'll continue to put pressure and our CVD process is all about [cranking out] (ph) cost and redesigning routes and optimizing fleets. And so, we'll continue to do that till the volume picks up. Our volume has just been steady, I would say, because we're coming outbound from the DCs and we want to deliver to stores and homes, and so it's been consistent. I can tell you when it's going to turn around, and we'll just continue to drive out cost as our volumes dictate. We've not -- I don't want to misspeak here, but we're not seeing hardly any pressure from our competition. What we're seeing on our existing fleets, we're just seeing cost pressure internally for the most part. And so that's kind of where we're at."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I wanted to provide an update on some areas of focus for our organization and how they align with the priorities for 2023 that I've previously shared, which are to: one, remain committed to discipline long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. As John mentioned, we remain committed to our investments around our company foundation: people, technology, and capacity. As I've stated before, our people intentionally come first. We believe in creating and providing a work environment where our people feel welcomed, valued, respected, safe, and heard. When we take care of our people, who are empowered and trained to take care of our customers, we create raving fans for our services which in turn supports our growth ambitions. We support this growth with investments in our technology and in our capacity, mainly trucks and trailing equipment. Importantly, our investments in technology and capacity are highly focused on efficiency, productivity, and safety. By remaining committed to our investments, we are prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers with our valued service offering. We have to be able to provide exceptional value to our customers at a competitive price that supports reinvestment in our business. As stated on the last two earnings calls that we are in a freight recession. While the environment remains uncertain, and demand for capacity is still muted, we remain very focused on how we grow with our customers, and we will continue to remain disciplined in our approach. We will do this by prudently managing our business in the near term focusing on controllable costs. We will also continue to focus on our resource and people needs and make sure we are appropriately aligned and cost competitive to support our ability to serve and grow with our customers. We remain committed to putting the company in a better position to accelerate growth and market share gains for the eventual inflection in market dynamics. We will continue to manage and balance this approach as we progress. In closing, by remaining committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology, and capacity, which supports our ability to deliver exceptional value for our customers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Hey, Scott, I might add to this. I think one of the things in our company foundations is technology. And when you think about our ability to serve our customers in 2021 and then 2022, we were able to leverage our technology investments to really step up, have a step function change from a growth perspective and delivering more value for our customers. As if you look at two of the tighter years, if you will, 2018, and then again coming into COVID, our technology further enhanced our ability to serve our customers. So, we look at our technology and not just as an investment of what return can we get on the investments that we're making, that is across our entire organization. And we evaluate every idea that comes across from our people from an investment lens. And so, for us, we let our customers give us feedback. They help drive our technology strategy. And then, you see that play out over a longer period of time as the company continues to grow and have long-term compounding returns on behalf of our shareholders. So that's a key part of our strategy. I don't see that changing. But we're always going to be prudent and watch how we spend and what returns we can get over the long term. Yeah. I might just say you've heard Darren make lots of comments around what's happening between he and Brad from a cycle perspective. I think it's difficult for us to say what's going to happen from a price perspective coming into this next bid season. I will say the majority of our pricing has been completed on the transactional side. Certainly, Dedicated doesn't have that impact as they're in longer-term agreements, and a majority of their business into some kind of industry from a price discussion. So I couldn't really say that, but I will say, certainly, cost to operate are higher, this go around than it would have been in 2018 or even going through the pandemic, inflation is across the board. And so I think that's why you heard Brad make comments around what's happening from carriers and price in general. I will say, although our second quarter, you did see the continued pressure from a freight recession, there were a lot of great things that happened, and we're really proud of the work. I want to make sure that I call out the strength and resiliency across our complementary business model, in particular, I believe Brad said Dedicated showed strong results and had a record in the quarter for operating income. I think that's important especially considering where we're at. But I also might make notice of Final Mile, who also continued improvement in profitability as they continue to work with customers and making sure we were paid appropriately for the hard work that we do and the value we create for them. We are encouraged with growth opportunities that we do see continuing in both our brokerage and power-only 360box offerings and Highway Services, and we're going to leverage our technology to continue to deliver on behalf of our customers. And we do think our Intermodal business is outperforming the industry. We continue to have meaningful and unique growth opportunities to capitalize on that ahead, and that's how we're going to focus moving into the second half of the year. You've heard us talk a lot about our growth and growth prospects, it isn't a matter of if but when. We will remain committed to our long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity and make sure that we're paid appropriately while understanding where we are in the short term. We will stay focused with our people because that's who delivers the great value for our customers. There are over 35,000 of us working hard every day, in particular, drivers on the road, and they're going to make sure we do a great job on behalf of our customers. And finally, that will drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. So, there's still something Darren said and take it out of Intermodal and take it into the organization because we are in a position that we know it's not a matter of if but when we are in a cold spring position on behalf of our customers across our entire organization. With that, I'll turn it over to John for closing remarks."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thanks everyone for joining us. I plan to review the performance of our Intermodal business and give an update on the market, our service performance, and the opportunity we have to deliver value to our customers. I'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity remained tempered, driven primarily by lower overall activity because of the inventory destocking cycle and the resulting declines in import activity. Volumes in the quarter declined 7% year-over-year, and by month were down 9% in April, down 8% in May, and down 4% in June. While we are hesitant to suggest the presence of any green shoots, we saw evidence from customers in June that the destocking trend has moderated. We experienced some pressure on margins in the quarter, largely related to the lack of volume and our inability to leverage our cost structure that is in the process of being built to handle significantly more volume. Volume growth is needed to drive down our unit cost as a broader portion of our portfolio was repriced this quarter. With regards to the market environment, but specifically to bid season wrapping up here in the near term, overall pricing for domestic Intermodal service fell within the range of our expectations as we entered the year, but our overall portfolio trended towards the lower end of those expectations as the bid season progressed. As it stands today, Intermodal continues to present a strong value proposition to customers with vastly improved service at a discount versus the truck alternative at least in line with historical averages, all while cutting the carbon emissions on a load of freight on average by 60% versus the haul truck alternative. We continue to see an enormous amount of freight to convert from Highway to Intermodal and have been working very closely with our primary rail providers to build resiliency in our networks, capacity and a comprehensive service offering to capitalize on the opportunity. As it relates to the overall service from our rail providers, I am encouraged by the trends we are seeing in velocity and on-time service quality, but more importantly, the commitments to collectively work towards an even better overall experience and value proposition for customers. We have stressed the importance of sustaining service through a volume recovery and that's where our joint focus is today. We'd like our position and feel confident in our rail provider's ability to handle more volume as recovery ensues. We believe we are in a unique position with our rail providers to accelerate growth for the domestic intermodal market by providing a differentiated service and value proposition for our customers. In closing, I want to make sure I reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity. As I stated last quarter and what has probably become more evident this quarter, we have a network built and resources available to handle significantly more volume than we are executing today. We remain in a coiled spring status better prepared to meet the future needs of our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. So, I'll turn it over Brad Hicks. Thanks, Allison. When we commented on a tremendous amount of loads that Intermodal can and should be the correct solution for, we've seen that for many, many years. I don't know that it's any more pronounced in the current environment than it's been for the last decade. The reality is we want to develop a better service product and better service experience for our customers with more predictability, and we're working every day today with our rail providers in order to achieve that. That will continue to be our focus as we move forward, and we know that the last, I'm going to call it, five years of rail service has been difficult. However, in today's environment, we're seeing significant improvements, and we're seeing significant commitments, including investments by our rail providers, to help us in this area. Well, coming into the year, we relied heavily on customer forecasts, and they were largely all wrong. And today, we're still a little cautious on what we expect as the year goes on. We will for all -- forever rely on feedback from our customers as we work together to provide capacity and grow solutions for them. So, I don't want anybody to hear green shoots. What I would say is last year Q2 was the strongest volume year. And as we move forward, the comps get easier, frankly, and that's an element as we move forward. But we know that we have the capacity and our customers are confident in what we do. They want to grow with us when their demand returns, and we'll be ready for that. Well, certainly, we were carrying extra cost in -- so far this year as we have extra equipment. We're not utilizing. We certainly took driver wages up a year ago. Those wages are certainly going to stay elevated and yet the market has challenged us with pricing and prices are negative. At this point, we really need more volume to unlock cost takeout from our system and improve the utilization of both our container fleet as well as our drayage fleet and then just the employee base supporting our business, all of which would give us an improvement in our margin profile. Well, that would constitute probably given a little bit of more direction on price than I really think we can. What I would say is our customers have asked for a better service, more consistent service product from us. We're working on providing that. I think that Intermodal has to provide the correct balance of value in the economics as well as the service quality. And that's why we're focused in those two areas. As we move forward, I think the discussions we've had with our customers are around how together can we take cost out to find advantages in pricing. And then, the Intermodal price will always lag the Truckload market. It's never quite as severe. And, certainly, the spot market in truck is a pretty small influencer on the Intermodal pricing overall. Contract drop trailer pricing plays a little bit more of a role in terms of our economics and the influence it might have on our customers purchasing of Intermodal. But I don't know that the spot market influence that we've seen on the Highway side is showing up in any form of dialogue with our customers. It's a data point. It's one of many that we keep an eye on. We have long asked ourselves if you just cut rate, do you just get more volume? And the reality is the two are not as yoked as you would think. You can cut your price and then haul the same amount of loads for a lower price. We spend a lot of time growing experience in our pricing teams, our sales organizations. They work very closely together in our pricing exercise and process is not quite as commodity like the way you described it. Certainly, as the correct opportunity presents itself, and it comes with volume that contributes to our organization at the correct investment level, if those economics we can meet, then we do that. And we look at them one opportunity at a time, always have, always will. Well, Scott, let me start first on margin. Price will always improve our margin faster than volume will. That will be the case for my entire career. I think you've heard us talk about the need for volume to see some improvement because that's the most likely influencer fastest. I don't anticipate any sort of pricing market in the near term that's going to help with our margin as quickly as we might see an opportunity to grow our volume. Meanwhile, when we announced a 150,000 container growth target over what is now more like two to four years, we did that with the mindset of growing our volume at a correct return, and that will continue to be our focus. So, on the pricing front, typical calendar year, and I would say this year is no different. We repriced 30% in the first quarter or implement 30% in the first quarter, 30% in the second, 30% in the third, and 10% in the fourth. I guess, the 10% in the fourth quarter would most likely be the next pricing cycle. So, as we get through this quarter, we'll really finish up implementation. I think that just as a general, we had some customers move a little faster this year. So, it's been earlier than what has been the historical norm. So, there's not that much new price left to implement as we move through the third quarter. And as far as the equipment goes, I think John Roberts highlighted it really well. We continue to see this enormous opportunity to grow our business with value to our customers. That being said, we're not going to ignore the fact that we ran into a slower time, and we did back off where we could. I don't want that to represent to our customers, most importantly, any hesitancy to bring on that equipment. We will continue our pipeline of equipment, but we're going to be prudent with our capital. We're going to be prudent with our expenses to the extent we can. And then, we'll speed it up just as fast as we can. There was a time three or four years ago we actually stopped it, and that taught us a big lesson and we don't want to do that unless forced to. But at this point, we believe in our long-term growth opportunity, and we're going to continue to bring on equipment. But we're going to be as smart about that as we can, and I think the quarter showed that we can slow that down at the right time when demand kind of fades for a little bit. So, I'll start on the West Coast. We had a number of customers that highlighted as soon as that contract negotiation was complete, they would consider moving back some of the East Coast imports through the West Coast. We haven't seen. It's not been real visible to us, but we are in dialogue with many of our customers talking about that opportunity. We still feel confident that the West Coast import opportunity for our customers is the fastest lowest cost answer. So, we're confident that we will see a slow move back to the West, not all of it. Some that went to the East will stay in the East, and we serve those markets as well. So, we're certainly glad that the West Coast labor negotiation is behind us at this point, and so, we'll continue to look for some benefits from that as the year moves on. So, why don't I start with the inventory question. What we -- what I think we recognize is coming into 2022 in the first half, our customers had made significant orders and they had a lot of inventories as sales began to decline. As those sales declined, they were full flushed with inventory, and it took them some time to burn through that. We're not suggesting that we've had any dialogue with any customer that suggests they don't want to maintain some level of inventory that is aligned with their sales. I mean, they're trying to match inventory with their sales. I'm not aware of any customer that wants to miss a sale because they didn't have inventory. Obviously, they don't want to do that. They're just being a little bit more cautious on the ordering process, and I think supply chain actually allows customers to get their orders faster than they were during the pandemic, and all of those factors are playing in a role. But I'm not aware of a single customer that wants to intentionally hold inventory down if that meant at risk their sales. Well, Jason, that's with the guidance, I think, what all I'd say is we continue to be encouraged by dialogue we have with our customers. We're prepared to grow. We're specifically prepared to grow on the West Coast as imports continue to improve and our economy, we're still waiting to see if there will be any kind of a holiday shipping season. Not a lot of predictions around that, but we'll have to wait and see. And I would -- the mix was a factor in the first quarter. We talked some about that, and you could see it just in the results of growth. As we move forward, it just depends on what our customers doing, what their sales are like, and unfortunately, I can't really answer your question as we're all waiting to find out the same answer to that question. So, we've been giving -- during the pandemic, we started providing the monthly volume change year-over-year, that's really all we're going to do in the monthly sequential view there, and anything moving forward is guidance that I just really can't provide. Well, I don't think volumes in the East in the quarter were significantly impacted by anything in Ohio. That [indiscernible] occurred back in, I think, early February if I'm not right if -- I don't recall the exact date. But certainly, the eastern network volumes in the first quarter were encouraging. They remain encouraging. I think a year ago, we had a lot of strength in our eastern network business. And we continue to present pricing and service solutions to our customers in those markets. I would also say that the Highway price is more competitive in the East than it is in the West, and so that plays a slightly more significant role in our eastern network. And I think that as the quarter went on, we really saw enormous improvement in our service performance from our well providers. And that wasn't the case necessarily in the first quarter, but we really experienced a lot of excellent service during the second quarter and we've got a let that play out and work with our customers so that they can see the quality of service and continue to give us an opportunity to grow as the year goes on. So first of all, on the comp period, I didn't intend for it to sound like June was an easier comp. June was actually our most difficult comparison month from '22. So, certainly, June had some positive signs in it. Again, we're still in a wait-and-see mode for the rest of the year."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. Similar to last quarter, I'll touch on a few items and reemphasize some key aspects about how we approach and manage the business. As usual, we have key members of our leadership team here to discuss specific areas of each segment. We've noted for several quarters now the shifting dynamics in the industry, and we see, in part, the product for that shift in our results for the second quarter. That said, we remain pleased with the collective and complementary nature of our business mix, some of which is revealed in our current results. For example, we see expected resiliency in certain areas of the business like DCS, areas with meaningful and unique growth opportunities to capitalize on in our Intermodal business, areas with notable improvement in performance in Final Mile, and areas of investment with a large addressable market and growing demand in our brokerage and power-only 360box offering in Highway Services. We maintain our perspective that all segments present meaningful growth opportunities looking forward. As you've heard us say consistently and for quite some time now, we remain committed to our investments in managing the business for the long term. The investments span across our company foundations, including our people, our technology and our capacity. We have a large addressable market and meaningful opportunity to provide unparalleled service and value to our customers across our complementary portfolio. We remain in pursuit of being better prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while staying disciplined on our cost and relying on our vast experience in the business and together here at J.B. Hunt. In closing, I remain confident in this leadership team. Our return-on-investment-focused approach for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders and our ability to differentiate ourselves in the market. Now, I'll turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson. Shelley? Hey, Amit. I'll address the question related to Yellow. One, we're probably not going to comment on that. But based upon the change in certain stock prices today, I guess we wish we were perceived to have some sort of benefit from whatever may be happening in the industry, LTL industry. And then, I'll pass second part of your question over to Darren. Yeah, let me make a comment just overall, then, Brad, I'll ask you to comment on kind of where we are with 360. But in general, I think the vision and strategy here is that while we know we're in some turbulent water, the opportunities that we see to invest in are probably as good as they've ever been in all aspects of the organization. I see certain changes being made lately that are even more encouraging from a capital allocation discipline standpoint. For instance, moving the power out of the JBT business into Dedicated is a step that is very consistent with long-term investment strategy and a perspective that we have such a huge addressable market and such really, really high-quality services and brand and team of people that are so committed that we would just be remiss to slow down. I know it feels a little off timing right now, but I -- even as of this morning, I continue to be super confident in the opportunity and our ability to execute on what is in front of us. And Brad, let me let you hit. Well, David, let me answer it this way. I mean, Darren provided information about the cadence of how contracts were implemented over the course of a year. As we enter Q3, a larger portion of our book of business will effectively be repriced. And so, as the year progresses, more and more of our overall portfolio or book of business is repriced at rates that are more commensurate to the environment we're in. And so it seems like that should give you an answer or at least some color to provide you direction of what you're trying to get at. And maybe just for the benefit of everyone on the call, Darren provided the monthly down 9, down 8, down 4 as the quarter progressed. In the prior-year period, April comp was plus 4, May was plus 9, and June was plus 10. So June was our toughest comp in the quarter. Thanks, Shelley. Great thoughts there. I've noted, as we discussed here, as we usually do in this call, we spend most of our time on the kind of current state, near term, appropriately. That's what you need to help continue to evaluate what you see here. I want to mention that we do manage and run our segments with intense focus on detail. It's one of the qualities that I think can set us apart when we do it right. And that's a daily, weekly, monthly evaluation of the critical elements of the business. And so when we look at the macro, when we talk about big compliance and other elements that are vital, it's also important to know that it's a very almost surgical approach that we take. I think we see short-term focused decisions yielding short-term results. And, accordingly, we just are more focused on positioning for that future opportunity than dealing with the current conditions, knowing that that future opportunity will need us to be ready. It does remain a when, not if question. And I can tell you that while I appreciate our composure on our long-term vision, we have great from a real-time work and focus under Shelley's leadership on the current issues that we face because of the freight recession that we're in. And so, I just want to emphasize, our focus here is on our customers, enriching our people's ability to serve our customers, and we are thinking of ourselves as a coiled spring. It's a great analogy, and I'm very, very pleased with the work so far. And we look forward to a great future and calls that we'll be able to give you updates also. So, appreciate you joining us today."

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some opening comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll touch on a few items, but will be brief with my comments as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business. As we have discussed, shifting dynamics in the market for several quarters now, it should be evident that freight demand is muted even when taking into account seasonal factors. As I stated last quarter, I believe this environment presents both opportunities and challenges for our company that will ultimately put us in a better position in the future. I am seeing, firsthand, how this team and might I add this experienced team is responding to set our company up for long-term success and compounding growth as we navigate through these demand patterns. We remain thoughtful in our approach to managing the business and controlling costs where it makes sense without sacrificing our preparedness to capitalize on large, meaningful and addressable opportunities for the company. We have and will always manage this business with a focus on long-term growth built on our company foundations, people, technology and capacity. In closing, I remain confident that the collective and complementary nature of our distinct business will again prove resilient in this environment, coupled with experience, a strong balance sheet and a long-term mindset, key elements which will continue to differentiate us in the market. We remain committed to investments and achieving our required return on those investments to support our long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson, for more details. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I thought it made sense to talk about where we are as an organization and what we are working on to set us up for long-term success. More importantly, how this aligns with our 2023 priorities that I've previously shared, which are to: one, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments and our people, technology and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. To start, we're in a challenging freight environment where there is deflationary price pressure for an industry that continues to face inflationary cost pressures. Simply stated, we're in a freight recession. As we have discussed, we believe we are in a position to deliver exceptional value for our customers by leveraging our full suite of services to deliver maximum efficiency and eliminate waste in the supply chain. We can do this by providing cost savings opportunities by converting on highway freight to intermodal, designing a highly engineered and efficient solution in our dedicated segment, leveraging vast amounts of market competitive capacity sourced on J.B. Hunt 360 or by providing best-in-class service as one of the largest final mile providers in North America. The strength and resiliency of our organization is supported by our mode neutral approach across all of our businesses and backed by our company foundation, which are, our people, technology, and capacity. And that's where we are today. So what are we working on? As we've committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity, we admittedly have too much cost in our system right now for the current level of activity in our organization. And while we want to prudently manage our business in the near-term by focusing on controllable cost, more importantly, we remain focused on our long-term strategy to compound our growth at acceptable returns. As an organization, we have put greater emphasis in areas of our business by reallocating resources that will set us up to accelerate our growth and performance coming out of this current environment. One area in particular that has immense focus is in the area of safety. Also, as you might have noticed in our release, we moved pieces of our JBT and ICS segments into DCS and FMS segments respectively to best position the organization longer-term. While none of our businesses are immune to this environment, I am confident that there are great things happening in our business that set us up for long-term success. Remaining committed to our disciplined investments while prudently managing our cost is an area of focus for us across our organization. In closing, I want to say, we remain cautious on the outlook for the year. But remain confident in our ability to deliver value for our customers that will enable us to grow and take share through cycles, while maintaining discipline on our returns on capital. As I have stated previously, we will remain focused on the things we can control, but remain committed to managing our business for the long-term. As I look across our organization and see the experience and tenure of our team as a result of the investments made throughout our careers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to touch on three topics with my prepared remarks, including a quick review of the quarter, some details on our capital plan for 2023 and bring to your attention some small changes we made in our segment reporting. First, on the quarter's results. As previously discussed, overall demand for freight capacity has moderated versus the prior year period as evidenced in our results. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year, operating income declined 17% and diluted earnings per share decreased 18%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes moderating pricing trends and inflationary cost pressures, particularly in the areas of salaries and wages, insurance and claims, and parts and maintenance-related expenses. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Regarding those investments, our capital plan still contemplates between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of investment in 2023. To provide some greater detail, we expect about $400 million to $500 million for real estate, which will support our long-term growth plans for the company. The majority of the balance is almost evenly split between our tractor and trailing capacity needs. Keep in mind, trailing capacity includes both dry and temperature controlled trailers and containers, as well as chassis. The growth in our intermodal and dedicated fleets in the past two years, coupled with the lack of availability of new equipment as OEM supply chains were constrained, required us to hold our equipment longer. Accordingly, a large portion of our 2023 tractor capital is for replacement needs. We did repurchase some shares in the quarter and remain committed to be active in the market as opportunities arise. Finally, we moved the majority of our J.B. Hunt owned tractors out of our JBT segment into DCS. These trucks have consistently operated in a dedicated like manner for customers over many years and makes more strategic sense to be managed out of our DCS segment, while also allowing JBT to focus its efforts on scaling our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering. Second, we moved our non-asset LTL business out of ICS and into Final Mile, which has similar operating characteristics as our Final Mile business. These realignments best position our organization for our future and focuses each segment's people and assets in particular areas of expertise. We have included an addendum in our earnings release to provide a historical perspective for these moves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide some comments on our dedicated contract services and Final Mile segments, and also give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. While demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remain strong, we have seen some moderation in our pipeline of opportunities. That said, we sold approximately 200 trucks of new business in the first quarter and remain optimistic about hitting our target for the year. Our net truck adds in the quarter increased 426, but included trucks transferred from JBT. Excluding this, our net truck count increased 28 units in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, this number was influenced by the cleaning up of extra trucks held due to the age of our fleet and also partly driven by our CVD or customer value delivery process. This process optimizes fleets to manage costs for our customers as demand levels in their business change. This supports our 98% retention and our future growth opportunities. To a lesser extent, we did see some account closures in the quarter. Overall, we continue to carry momentum from our success over the last year, which drove revenue and operating income growth of 13% and 29%, respectively, in the quarter. Now on the Final Mile. As we discussed last quarter, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment is soft, but this hasn't deterred us from our commitment to improving capability in this segment. Our efforts are focused on ensuring we are getting appropriately compensated for our high quality differentiated service product in the market. We continue to put business at risk during this renewal processes. And at this point, we remain pleased with our ability to retain business. This is, in my opinion, a testament to our service. Encouragingly, we are seeing some activity in the pipeline, but overall demand remains tempered in the segment. I'll close with some comments on safety. We continue to make significant investments in our training and new technologies to improve safety performance in our operations. As a result, we recently announced the rollout of inward facing cameras across our fleet to help address the distracted driving and other coachable activities with our driving workforce. This is a big step for our organization, follow our similar board moves in our history to lead in the area of safety, including [1996] (ph) increasing our pay package to attract experienced drivers, which resulted in a 50% reduction in DOT preventable accidents. In 2006, supplementing the DOT urine drug test with hair testing, which resulted in an 87% decrease in DOT post-accident positive rates. Then in 2011, rolling out forward collision warning systems which delivered nearly a 50% reduction in rear end accident frequency. In 2016, rolling out forward facing cameras with drove an 18% reduction in collision frequency per million miles. I am proud of our company's commitment to the safety of our employees and the motoring public. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity. I'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was tempered, driven by overall freight activity. But specifically lower imports and elevated inventory levels across the supply chain. Volumes in the quarter declined 5% year-over-year and by month were down 2% in January, down 4% in February and down 8% in March. As we stated in our earnings release, transcontinental volumes were down 9% in the quarter, but our Eastern volumes were up 1%. I think this is an important call out as we have been growing volumes in the East, which is the most truck competitive market, while being in a depressed truckload environment. This mix shift to shorter length of haul freight does influence contribution dollars per load which did impact us in the quarter, but also should signal our ability to deliver value to our customers in this market. Rail service predictability and consistency has improved to near pre pandemic levels, while customer detention of equipment improved even further and as the quarter progressed. While we have seen a decline in revenue associated with the detention of equipment, we have not yet offset that impact with the onboarding of new volume. As I've stated recently, our network and service offering is a coil spring that can handle significantly greater volume today and unlock a lot of value for our customers and our company. We have the people, the drake capacity, and the containers that could handle upwards of 15% to 20% more volume today. As we have shared recently, we have been meeting with customers and continue to be encouraged by the feedback we are receiving about our service. Customers trust us and our say/do culture. They believe in our Intermodal product and they want more of it, but part of that is influenced by the economy and overall freight demand. We feel very confident that we have a differentiated product in the market that will support our ability to take share. We are encouraged by the results we are getting so far in the bid process and look forward to the opportunity to prove the value we can deliver to our customers. In closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise and its opportunities to drive significant growth over many years. It provides significant value for our customers with opportunities to save money by converting freight from the highway to intermodal which reduces costs and is further supported by fuel costs and carbon emission savings. We are in the best position to commit more intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress further through the current bid season, which should present meaningful opportunities to unlock value in our network for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our integrated capacity solutions and truckload segments, but we collectively call Highway Services. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. But before we begin, as mentioned in our release, we carved out our LTL operations from ICS which are now included in Final Mile. We also carved out most of the operations of our company owned trucks from JBT which are now included in DCS results. I will speak to our results on a reported basis with the adjustment to our prior period. Regarding this shift, we believe this better aligns the management of these particular businesses and allows Highway to focus our efforts on leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source third party capacity for the movement of full truckload freight. Now turning to the business, I'll start off with ICS. Top line revenue was down 42%, driven largely by a 25% decline in volume. The truckload market continues to see significant pressure on both volume and price and we are certainly seeing that, particularly in the spot market as our contractual truckload volumes were up in the quarter. Touching on our volume performance, we are not immune to the market, but we are also not meeting our expectations. That said, I want to remind you of the work ICS powered by J.B. Hunt 360 handled a year ago to help meet the needs of our Intermodal and Dedicated customers as congestion and equipment delays tempered our ability to serve their needs. ICS was able to step in and cover freight which is a testament to the power of our scroll and our mode neutral approach. However, as we stand here today, we are clearly facing tougher comps as a result of that dynamic. Now moving to truckload. Similar to my message last quarter, we continue to see demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better than the market, although we are not fully immune from the market dynamics. Our 360 box volumes were up double digits in quarter as customers continue to like the flexibility of blending their live and drop trailer capacity needs by utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. As it pertains to both segments, our goal remains to leverage our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. While the market is challenging, we are focused on controlling our costs. That said, we do remain committed to our long-term investments in our people and technology to deliver exceptional value for all of our stakeholders. Rapping up quickly on 360, we have built the foundation of our platform and what we need to commercialize to our customers and carriers. Our task now is to scale and optimize these investments. As you might have noticed, we did back up on some of the stats on 360, both on a dollar and a percentage basis. A significant portion of that is market driven, but some of that was intentional in the quarter. We did have to insert some manual processes and restrict some third party capacity on the platform to manage risks around several large cargo theft rings. This did impact profitability in both segments in the quarter. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give some instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Thanks, Brad. And Sierra in the interest of time and based on the number of callers we have in queue, we're going to do one question with no follow ups. Sierra, you can queue for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Question, can you maybe touch base a little bit on -- little more color around the customer signals you're hearing on Intermodal. I know it's sort of a cautious outlook, but perhaps relative to what you're thinking in January with inventory restocking, even thoughts on second half peak season. Is there any sort of change in signaling from when you guys talked to us back in January? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Yeah. So, throughout the quarter, I think we were successful in the bid cycle. And some of that volume hasn't really materialized. Our customers, throughout the quarter, did remain optimistic for stronger volumes in the second half of the year. We shared at multiple conferences that we are slightly less optimistic than our customers. The end of the day, our volumes and customer bid compliance is at an all-time low. And so that naturally creates some question marks. Our customers want more of what we do when they need it. Import volumes are clearly not strong. And so there is question marks out there about what will happen in the second half of the year. And so, as the quarter went on, I would say, we're slightly less optimistic. We've said that multiple times. Outside of that, I don't know what else to say other than I know our customers do want our capacity as soon as the import volumes return to normal.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please proceed.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, I'm going to stick with you and the bid process. You said you're encouraged by the results so far. Can you just explain a little bit? Are you encouraged by the wins you're getting? Are you encouraged by pricing maybe being a bit more resilient than maybe the freight recession that Shelley referenced would typically indicate to the extent that it's a latter? Any type of numbers you can give around kind of year-over-year sequential pricing comparisons within those good processes?\nDarren Field: Yeah. So I'm not going to give any guidance on this call to be clear. I think we're encouraged by both and encouraged by both price and volume, meaning, I think we're winning volume that our customers believe that they will have. And encouraged by price in that, I don't think it's behaved any more challenging than what we expected coming into the year. Look, there's challenge on price, there's also cost to take out, part of the cost to take out comes with volume pouring over the top. And so, we're encouraged by the volume wins we have received on paper. We are -- we haven't seen all that volume yet. So there are, again, kind of like the last question still a handful of question marks out there. But I would say the bid season -- I remain optimistic about our future. There is going to [how many day] (ph) when imports improve from where they are. When will that be? I don't know the answer to that. But it will improve and we stand to gain tremendously when that happens.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So, Darren, you've got 17% of the boxes parked in Q1. Are you still buying boxes? Are you -- and parking more? Are there any green shoots that have you un-parking any boxes? And then, as I look ahead, I suspect Intermodal price probably moves lower from Q1 to Q2. In that kind of environment, can Intermodal margin earnings improve from Q1 to Q2? Or does price naturally just take the margin earnings down a bit more?\nDarren Field: Well, number one, I'm not going to guide you on that second half of that question. I think as it relates to the equipment and storage, when we buy our equipment, we're buying it for the long-term. When we announced in March of 2022, a pathway to 150,000 containers over 3 years to 5 years, that's because the opportunity that presents itself to us for the long-term is significant. We did slow down onboarding equipment during the first quarter from the run rate we had been on in the back half of 2022. Velocity from our rail providers as well as customer unloading has unlocked a tremendous amount of capacity. And so, our opportunity to grow even while equipment is in storage remains intact and we have ample capacity do what we need with our customers. Look, in terms of the margin profile as we move forward, we continue to be confident in our ability to take cost out as we pour volume over the top. We have long-term margin targets that are not being changed, and we're confident in our ability to win and grow with our customers at acceptable returns.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Darren, may be sticking with you here, just in terms of just the outlook for Intermodal for 2023, you're pretty clear on the last conference call about your expectations for growth from the business. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just want to make sure I understand sort of what your expectations are for whether it be revenue loads, profit for the segment for 2023 and what maybe has changed if anything?\nDarren Field: So listen, on the first -- on the fourth quarter call back in January, I did say I expect it to grow revenue loads and income. J.B. Hunt's growth company, that's our expectation around here every day, no matter what the conditions. That statement wasn't intended to be guidance, but clearly that's how it was interpreted. Again, as we go through the year, we're working with customers, talking to them about what their expectations are and that largely defines our own. And as we go through -- as we were coming into the year, we've probably had a lot of confidence in demand growth as 2023 went on. At this point, our customers have been less accurate than ever before. And so, we're still waiting to see what happens. As far as an update to that statement, I don't have an update for you. I know our system is built to handle 15% to 20% more as I said in my prepared comments and we look forward to growing with our customers through the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe I'll just take a step back from Intermodal and John Roberts. I had a high level question for you. So, if we see weakness in the freight market and the economy persists into the second half, how does that change the way you think about managing the business in terms of both your growth plans and the cost structure? And are you already making any pivots today based on how your expectations for the rest of the year have evolved?\nJohn Roberts: Hey, Justin. Well, I think the real question is the timing, Darren, said it. I talked to Shelley earlier today about the same idea that it's not really a question of if the freight demand will come back to normal. It's just really a question of when. And having the experience that we have around this table has really helped us position our thinking and our direction because we've been through freight cycles in the past. Some of us have been through quite a number of freight cycles in the past. And so, we know these times are coming. And if you look at what we've done with the company over the last maybe 10 years or so, every time we go through a cycle, we learn something about how our business runs up and then back down. And we have made very serious and intentional decisions about, for instance, how we place assets. You'll note that, I think Brad in your comments, we've transitioned essentially all of the power into dedicated where we can monitor it differently because we can see things in dedicated business model in a way that we like differently than we can sometimes see in a network mode. And so, if we look at where we are right now, and we think, oh well, maybe this timing we didn't quite get that right. That's going to be part of the reality that we live in. And because we have the experience and because the folks that are around this table have made mistakes and made good decisions, I think we're really just questioning how we -- how we time our reentry into a more normalized system. Now we are in leadership positions in many of our businesses. And our customers really appreciate that. We can handle scale. And so we don't want to lose any of that positioning value. I can say that right now, as we started to see the year presented itself a little differently than we had expected from our planning sessions, immediate action and intense focus has been taken on elements of cost. As Darren pointed out, we're running our playbooks through bids. I think Nick will comment on what his business looks like, what we're seeing in the world Highway Services. Those things are teaching us that we got to be a maybe a little bit more fluid. It's a word that Shelley used with me earlier today. And I am aware, of course, we're not going to speak of details, but I\u2019m aware of many efforts and elements that are ongoing today that will really continue to help us stay healthy. While we get to that other side which we know is not a question of if it will present itself but when. So we just have to be patient and careful and thoughtful.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hey, Darren. I just want to circle back on the bit compliance. I think a couple of quarters ago you talked 60% to 70%. Where is that number now? Just trying to get a sense. And then just you've always talked about a lot of cost in the system that can come out. And so, I guess, another way to ask that, when I look at operating profit dollars per load, it's basically almost doubled from 2020 to 2022. And I guess the question is, how much of that gain do you think you can hold on to as the volume environment remains challenging and that there's like a pricing reset really at the start of the back half of the year. So bit compliance and then kind of talk about your ability to maintain the line on operating profit dollars per load?\nDarren Field: And it is impressive how you guys get more than one question in. So bit compliance is sub 60, middle 50\u2019s. It's terrible. It's an all-time worst. So we'll see when that improves. Obviously, our transcontinental business is largely tied to imported goods and there's real significant challenge with bid compliance on that business is pretty poor. The cost takeout, one of the thoughts there has been, hey, we had weakness in velocity, so spreading the fixed cost of owning the equipment over more loads with better velocity is a cost takeout, but that comes with volume. We had driver productivity challenges as a result of poor rail service. And as rail service improves, we get stronger driver productivity and better utilization of our drayage assets. That's a cost takeout on per load economics. And then just staffing and overhead and how do we pour more loads over the system without adding overhead? And all of those actions are available to us that come with volume. Will we sustain the current op income per load? I don't have any idea. I know this that we're going to be happy with the return profile on our business. And our customers want more of our product, and I think that gives us an opportunity to price it fairly and anticipate a fair return for the work that we do. We must provide them an excellent customer service experience and we have to be good at communicating what their experience should be like, but I don't have any guidance on income per load. What I know is, we have a long-term margin target. We'll live within those boundaries and we expect that our return is going to be warrants reinvestment in our business.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the, I guess, normalization of operating profit per load. Can you just talk about the congestion fees? It sounds like the costs are still there to come out, but what about the congestion fees if you're not really seeing the detention times as high as they were at the customers? And then if you can just talk broadly on safety, you did mention a few times. I think it might be a little hard to move the needle but it has been a challenge in the past. So be curious to hear your thoughts on how quickly you can make some improvements there? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. I'll quickly touch on the storage fees [indiscernible] is really what I think you're getting at. We highlighted many times we're not going to break that out. I don't think that -- we've said before, don't over assume how much of a factor that is in terms of our income. Clearly customers are unloading faster. That revenue was down in the quarter year-over-year. And the results are the results. The cost takeout does come faster with volume [indiscernible] system. I'll let Nick come in on safety.\nNick Hobbs: Yes, I'll take the safety question. We were faced with some challenges clearly in Q1, saw some last year. We had a tremendous growth. In the meantime, we have tremendous growth across the organization with new managers, new drivers. It presents some challenges to us. We're encouraged by the progress we're making. Still got a long way to go. In addition to that, the inward facing cameras, we're rolling that out. And so, we think that's going to -- well, we know it's going to take us another year and a half to two years to get fully implemented, but we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing there. So I would just say we're focused on it and we'll keep chipping away on our safety numbers. And we've seen good results so far at the end of Q1 from what we've seen.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good evening. Just on Intermodal volumes, could you maybe talk about the sequential trends you saw in the quarter and how they compare with what you would typically see in terms of seasonality in Q1? Just any thoughts there?\nJohn Roberts : Well, I mean, we highlighted negative two in January, negative four in February, negative eight in March. I think that we would normally anticipate our volumes to be improving year-over-year every month of the year. And then historically, the first quarter might actually trail the fourth quarter in terms of volume and then you build back up over the course of the year. And I would call that very normal that Q2 is growing over Q1, Q3 even over one and then four is going to be your strongest quarter, take a little step back in the first quarter of the next year and then keep growing. That is -- that's probably a 15 year historical view. That would be very normal. Right now when I go back to a year ago, volumes were really strong. I think the second quarter last year was probably our record volume quarter at any time in any year. And imports were strong and as the second half last year continued import flows began to change and so we'll have to see what that means this year. But as we move into the rest of the year, we do anticipate that we can get back on a growth trajectory, but we're also in a little bit of a wait and see and wait for customer to -- compliance to improve and demand particularly on the West Coast to improve.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. I guess, John, Shelley, or I guess, Brad, just to continue on that. You noted we're in a freight recession accelerating declines with down 8%. I guess you're saying that it gets even tougher as you move into April and 2Q. I guess are there any signs of -- from an ICS point of view, seeing capacity come out? Is there anything you're starting to see peaking out of inventory levels? Any signs on how we could see this peak out or is 2Q going to be -- it sounds like from that last commentary maybe even worse than 1Q.\nBrad Hicks: Yeah, Ken. This is Brad. I'll start from an ICS perspective and anybody else is free to add in there. As we came into the year, Darren covered nicely what our kind of macro thoughts were and we're seeing more pronounced in highway and in ICS in particular kind of the freight recession impact. We're not really seeing a high volume of carriers exit at this point, although you can see in our reported data that we did reduce our active carriers. That was in part to my comment on some of the [indiscernible] that that we saw occur in in the quarter. And so, we kind of called out and establish new parameters there. So that's not an indication necessarily of carrier loss. It was our processes and protocols that we implemented to create better protection for us against that specific set of circumstances. And quite frankly, the market itself more pronounced in spot. We were a little bit over indexed through the height of the pandemic in fisting our customers and their disrupted need. And quite frankly, we were probably behind on the published side coming into this current environment. We work tirelessly to recover from that. And I think you can see we're north of 60% on published freight at this point in time. But obviously the heavy volume was in spot and what occurred to spot in the back half of last year in the first part of this year with a negative to our overall book and our overall performance.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Ken. I might add just a couple things to that. You know, we do see a low point of what's happening in spot. And from a capacity perspective, our evaluation of how cures can perform in this environment makes it very difficult for spot to go significantly lower. I'm not suggesting we've completely found the bottom, but we have seen a more leveling out, Brad, of what's happening in the spot market. So just from a capacity perspective, we estimate that they are losing money to breaking even at this point. It have been for a period of time. Typically, that can't last for a long period of time. So it'd be one note that I would say. And from an inventory perspective, we did spend a lot of time with our customers. I think they are struggling to really forecast what consumers are going to do. It's one of the reasons that we're more cautious on our outlook. Certainly, what Darren talked about on bid compliance, that's just an intermodal, JBT is similar. The brokerage side is even worse than that. So across all of our transactional businesses, I would say it's been very difficult for our customer to forecast. I think that's the reason we're not giving any more color as to what we think for the back half of the year. We can go off of their optimism and them wanting to purchase our services, but I think it's just a little more caution from us as to what the timing will be in total.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could give some comments on the revenue per load in Intermodal. We saw, I think, it's about a 9% decline sequentially 1Q versus 4Q. Is that a function of lower contract rates or is that accessorial and other? And maybe just kind of how we think about the cadence of when new contract rates affect the business. Is that -- did you see that in 1Q, or does that really not start until 2Q? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I think there's a lot in that question. Mix of our business can play an enormous role and we highlighted that we were negative 9% transcon, plus 1% East. That's going to influence our overall revenue per load. Certainly, all of the factors you highlighted are part of it. In terms of the way we implement pricing, what we've highlighted multiple times is, we implement approximately 30% of our business in Q1, 30% in Q2, 30% in Q3 and 10% in Q4. Current cycle, so I don't know that it's any different than that. There's -- customers -- our ability to predict what's going on with that. I mean, Shelley just highlighted it. It's never been more challenging to know just what's going to happen with volumes. And I said earlier, I mean, the pricing market has largely behaved like we would have expected. And we expected some negative pressure on price. So I don't know how to give you any kind of further info on what to expect with price. I just know that certainly the impact of shorter length of haul and growth in the East more than transcon, once our transcon gets back to normal, you can expect that that would be helpful to the revenue per loan.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nAri Rosa: Hi, good afternoon. So we've seen a lot of changing dynamics out West, obviously, with some of your IMC competitors switching between railroads. I'm a little surprised to see, I guess, the extent of the weakness in volumes. I was hoping you could just talk about the dynamics of what's driving the weakness out West. Is it really just that kind of international intermodal business? Or is there an element that's being driven by competition? And then in that context, how are you thinking about your ability longer term to take share, particularly in the West? Thanks.\nJohn Roberts: Okay. Well, let me be very clear. I don't believe we're losing share in the West to a competitor. I feel very confident that our customers want our business. We'll have to prove it that we're taking share, but I feel very confident in our competitive environment against IMCs on the Union Pacific. Largely, the weakness in the West is almost purely related to the import economics. International Intermodal that comes in and goes intact is down, but so is just imports in general that feed warehouses throughout California and then create full truckload shipments out of there and the transload model. So all of that business is down. But I do expect and anticipate that J.B. Hunt is growing share in all markets in Intermodal.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed.\nBascome Majors: You're heading into the year, it didn't feel like either Hunt or retailers are really broadly in the market. There was a lot of expectation for import recovery either in the West Coast or nationally in the first quarter. And so, I wanted to drill into a little more of what really or what was the most impactful change that really caused you to discount your optimism over the 2.5 months or 3 months since we talked in January. And on the other side of that, what one or two shifts do you want to see either in data you track or your customer messaging to ratchet that optimism back up? Thank you.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I mean, I don't know that we anticipated strength or rebound in imports in Q1. When we talk about what might have gradually changed over the course of the quarter, again, it was that compliance and just continued uncertainty from our customers about what the consumer was going to do and what order would be like. I think we felt that a lot in the first quarter as we met with customers and you could see as time went on their ability to forecast and even know what to expect, we had questions and that's what has created our change to some degree. What do we need to happen? We need imports to improve. We need a West Coast labor agreement to finalize and give customers confidence in the West Coast to import programs more than anything we need in the economy and the goods economy to improve. That will drive the fastest response and inventories to bleed off.\nShelley Simpson: Bascome, I would add to that. I think we're using our experience through the cycles to create more cautiousness in what we think on the timing for 2023. We have a lot of customers asking us those questions. I think they have a lot of optimism and they want things to improve. We don't have the data to help support some of that. So I think it's more of our experience that's having us have a slight change. I spoke earlier that we're less optimistic, but it is a timing issue more than anything.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from David Zazula with Barclays. Please proceed.\nDavid Zazula: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If you could just talk a little bit about dedicated and just what the expected pace is for truck sales this year? Whether you're expecting customers to lean maybe a little more into dedicated, like, given some of the services it's going to provide in 2023?\nJohn Roberts: Thanks for that question. We've had -- we've been talking about and looking at our sales compared to last year and last year was just terrific and our sales have slowed down a touch. But we're very optimistic when we look in the pipeline. And we're starting to see some of our customers really ask some questions on some private fleets that we're working on to really take out cost and using our engineering resources to really not just put out a procurement bid, but really how can we do things more efficient since their volume was down. So we're encouraged by that. So I would say we still will hit our targets. We feel comfortable hitting our sales targets that we lay out every year. So we're optimistic. Our volumes in general are okay, I would say, in Dedicated. So we're continuing to go to the stores and all the things that we do on a consistent not robust, but we have a lot of interest from a lot of different customers looking for us to help them with some solutions to take out cost. And we think that plays into our strength very nicely.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Elliot Alper with Cowen. Please proceed.\nElliot Alper: Great. Thank you. Staying on the Dedicated side. You spoke out about the pipeline beginning to soften a bit. I guess, is there anything more you can share on that? Are these customers reducing their freight need by, say, X number of trucks? Are you seeing pockets of weakness in certain product categories?\nJohn Roberts: I would say we're clearly seeing some weakness when it comes to building and construction, it\u2019s where we're seeing some stuff and we kind of look at it by industry kind of on the [indiscernible] side around that. But overall, I would just say, when I say it's slowing down, we're seeing decisions. We've got a lot of stuff out there waiting decisions on it. Our customers are a little more skittish on making decisions, trying to figure out what's happening with their core business. And we've seen more decisions in the last couple of weeks pick up from what we've seen the previous month. So hopefully that's a little bit a lot in our area, but we feel very optimistic about it.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please begin.\nBruce Chan: Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just a clean up here for John Kuhlow, specifically around the segment realignment. I'm wondering if there are any savings that we should expect in that process just in terms of leveraging people that maybe perform similar functions? Or is that really just more of a reporting or commercial impact there?\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes. I think -- I don't want to draw too much attention to this, it was a little bit more of a reporting. And looking at our services, we felt like those as we talked about, we felt like those services -- could be better managed and/or more aligned in some of the different segments. And so that's why we made the move. We do feel like once in those segments, there can be some margin improvement there. But for the most part, it\u2019s more of an accounting and reporting issue to get those more aligned to where the other similar services are.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our final question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in here towards the end. I'm wondering if you can maybe talk about your posture into this bid season. Are you are you kind of approaching it in a more balanced fashion? Are you focusing on maybe a little bit of share take just given that we're in what sounds like based on your commentary, a temporary downturn in in freight demand? Just trying to think about how you guys are thinking about managing this period of uncertainty, particularly around the Intermodal bids?\nJohn Roberts: Well, I'll start with Highway. We've been very public in our desire to grow our published volumes in particular in ICS. We have had success in doing that, not enough at this point to offset the overall decline in freight demand. And I will highlight that we did see growth inside of our 360 box offering in the quarter, double digit growth and so very satisfied with the trajectory and the growth of that particular product offering for our customers. And so, we have largely met our bid goals. However, as mentioned numerous times, not just in intermodal, but in all of our transactional businesses, the bid compliance from our customers is at an all-time low. And so we really yet to see or feel the benefit of those wins at this point in time. And obviously, as mentioned, we don't have really a good crystal ball as to if -- not so much if, but when they will recover it?\nDarren Field: So I'll hit on intermodal on that question from a posture going into the bid cycle. I mean, we spent the better part of 2021 and 2022 without enough capacity to truly do everything that our customers wanted us to do caused by weakness in velocity, caused by slow unloading, slower rail service. And so, our posture in 2000 -- this bid cycle, in the 2023 bid cycle has just been to communicate with our customers that things are normalizing with our velocity and our capacity, we went out and acquired and announced publicly a mission to grow our capacity up to 150,000 containers in three to five years. And we're trying to really give our customers confidence that we're going to be there for them, that we're aware that costs had increased for them and that we felt like we could get some cost takeout by growing volume in our system. And so our approach has been to grow with our customers, but our approach is always to cover our investment with appropriate returns. And so, that's a balancing act. If you're asking, did we just set out to take share? We set out to grow because that's always our mission. That will be our mission next tomorrow and the next day and from here on forward. So that was our posture as we move into the bid season.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Darren. And I do feel like our mission is to help our customers continue to take cost out of the supply chain. We've outlined how we can do that through all of our segments. But let me say, we've talked about thriving in any market. And this is a tough market, but there have been good fundamentals happening inside of our businesses. I think in the first quarter, you saw the resiliency of our dedicated contract services model. As they recorded a record quarter one to other quarter ones in both revenue and operating income and still continued demand from our customers in that segment. We're proud of the work that's happened in Intermodal and we have a healthy business model. We did a great job on our quality of revenue and continuing just maintain and stay within our margin targets, while having a lot of demand from our customers for our long-term. 360 box has grown in an environment that's had declining volumes in total signaling that our customers continue to want our services in those areas. We are very pleased with the progress, but yet want to continue to move forward in our Final Mile segment on improving our financial performance there. And finally, we are seeing some improved fundamentals as the quarter progressed and here coming into Q2 and ICS as they are carefully managing their cost in tech and people relative to what's happening in this environment. And while we're cautious on the timing of their recovery in this freight recession, we're going to focus on striking a balance between short term managing our costs, to more in line with current volumes, while being prepared and ready for long-term growth with our customers that will drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. And we will remain committed to our three core fundamentals, our people, our technology, and our capacity. And like I say, Darren talked about our people and our safety culture, and it is the number one focus organizationally, how we drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders and how we drive more value for our customers is leaning into our people, taking care of our people, and making sure that they can trust us, our customers ultimately trust them. And as a result, we grow over the long-term. So I want to say thank you to the people that have been performing for us. It has been a difficult environment that they can weather the environment as we went up during the pandemic, we're seeing the same decline just on the inverse of what happened on the incline. I cannot say enough about what our people are doing to deliver. Sometimes our results don't always show the hard work and effort that's happening as a result. But over the long-term, we feel confident that our people will get to see the fruit of their labor.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Shelley. I'll just close this by saying that, as we look at this turbulence, we are very confident in our structure overall, our asset structure for each business makes sense to us in a way that it hasn't always for me. And I think we finished a lot of the work coming into 2023 that needed to be done. So that things like 360 box could have a chance to get that traction. It's looking for as a very unique and we think very needed service. I'm thankful that we asked a question here about Dedicated, although it did take 50 minutes of the hour call to get to it. Because I think we're again reminding everyone that that's a very different business than I think what is it is interpreted as. And in this tough climate where you see radical changes in some of our channel demand, you see a real steady state, a very resilient business that is asset intense, but also has a very different rate and contract structure that we are the industry leader at providing. And I think when we take it up to return on invested capital, we look at the performance of margins in intermodal at this point. We look at the performance and all of the businesses that do require more capital, that's why I say I think we're in a better position than we've ever been in. Shelley talked about responding to the market signals, the market changes. Right now, we are doing that. And I think there is a very, very quick response at this level with this team to address challenges that are weren't expected necessarily. But with the most important part of that conversation being about the long-term, we are a long-term company. Our addressable market is somewhere in the high hundreds of billions of dollars. And so, when we say we're a growth company, that's because as industry leaders, we have fractional percentages of the markets that we serve even in the number one spot. So we like where we're at. We have a strong view. We will make tweaks. Remember on CapEx, when you think about that, a good portion of our CapEx is replacement. We had plenty of trouble through the pandemic in getting equipment replaced that we needed. I think we will look at timing on other elements of CapEx expansion and growth. And with DCS, that model is a pull system anyway. So it only triggers being our heaviest demand when it is asked to or after a deal is closed. So I think that that all goes back to the idea of probably more cautious about the rest of this year than we were three months ago to that question based on the facts and data that we're seeing. And we will respond, but we know this. Last point, it's not a question of yes, this is coming back. It's just a question of when and what position will we be in when our customers start ringing our phone again in ways that they have in the past. Thank you for calling in today.\nOperator: That concludes the J.B. Hunt 1Q 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon. I'll review the performance of our integrated capacity solutions and truckload segments, but we collectively call Highway Services. I will also provide an update on J.B. Hunt 360. But before we begin, as mentioned in our release, we carved out our LTL operations from ICS which are now included in Final Mile. We also carved out most of the operations of our company owned trucks from JBT which are now included in DCS results. I will speak to our results on a reported basis with the adjustment to our prior period. Regarding this shift, we believe this better aligns the management of these particular businesses and allows Highway to focus our efforts on leveraging our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to source third party capacity for the movement of full truckload freight. Now turning to the business, I'll start off with ICS. Top line revenue was down 42%, driven largely by a 25% decline in volume. The truckload market continues to see significant pressure on both volume and price and we are certainly seeing that, particularly in the spot market as our contractual truckload volumes were up in the quarter. Touching on our volume performance, we are not immune to the market, but we are also not meeting our expectations. That said, I want to remind you of the work ICS powered by J.B. Hunt 360 handled a year ago to help meet the needs of our Intermodal and Dedicated customers as congestion and equipment delays tempered our ability to serve their needs. ICS was able to step in and cover freight which is a testament to the power of our scroll and our mode neutral approach. However, as we stand here today, we are clearly facing tougher comps as a result of that dynamic. Now moving to truckload. Similar to my message last quarter, we continue to see demand for drop trailing capacity holding up better than the market, although we are not fully immune from the market dynamics. Our 360 box volumes were up double digits in quarter as customers continue to like the flexibility of blending their live and drop trailer capacity needs by utilizing the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. As it pertains to both segments, our goal remains to leverage our J.B. Hunt 360 platform and make investments that will allow us to scale our business by outpacing the market. While the market is challenging, we are focused on controlling our costs. That said, we do remain committed to our long-term investments in our people and technology to deliver exceptional value for all of our stakeholders. Rapping up quickly on 360, we have built the foundation of our platform and what we need to commercialize to our customers and carriers. Our task now is to scale and optimize these investments. As you might have noticed, we did back up on some of the stats on 360, both on a dollar and a percentage basis. A significant portion of that is market driven, but some of that was intentional in the quarter. We did have to insert some manual processes and restrict some third party capacity on the platform to manage risks around several large cargo theft rings. This did impact profitability in both segments in the quarter. That concludes my comments. So I'll turn it over to Brad Delco to give some instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Yeah, Ken. This is Brad. I'll start from an ICS perspective and anybody else is free to add in there. As we came into the year, Darren covered nicely what our kind of macro thoughts were and we're seeing more pronounced in highway and in ICS in particular kind of the freight recession impact. We're not really seeing a high volume of carriers exit at this point, although you can see in our reported data that we did reduce our active carriers. That was in part to my comment on some of the [indiscernible] that that we saw occur in in the quarter. And so, we kind of called out and establish new parameters there. So that's not an indication necessarily of carrier loss. It was our processes and protocols that we implemented to create better protection for us against that specific set of circumstances. And quite frankly, the market itself more pronounced in spot. We were a little bit over indexed through the height of the pandemic in fisting our customers and their disrupted need. And quite frankly, we were probably behind on the published side coming into this current environment. We work tirelessly to recover from that. And I think you can see we're north of 60% on published freight at this point in time. But obviously the heavy volume was in spot and what occurred to spot in the back half of last year in the first part of this year with a negative to our overall book and our overall performance."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to touch on three topics with my prepared remarks, including a quick review of the quarter, some details on our capital plan for 2023 and bring to your attention some small changes we made in our segment reporting. First, on the quarter's results. As previously discussed, overall demand for freight capacity has moderated versus the prior year period as evidenced in our results. On a consolidated GAAP basis, revenue for the quarter declined 7% year-over-year, operating income declined 17% and diluted earnings per share decreased 18%. These declines were primarily driven by lower freight volumes moderating pricing trends and inflationary cost pressures, particularly in the areas of salaries and wages, insurance and claims, and parts and maintenance-related expenses. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity available to support our investments to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Regarding those investments, our capital plan still contemplates between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of investment in 2023. To provide some greater detail, we expect about $400 million to $500 million for real estate, which will support our long-term growth plans for the company. The majority of the balance is almost evenly split between our tractor and trailing capacity needs. Keep in mind, trailing capacity includes both dry and temperature controlled trailers and containers, as well as chassis. The growth in our intermodal and dedicated fleets in the past two years, coupled with the lack of availability of new equipment as OEM supply chains were constrained, required us to hold our equipment longer. Accordingly, a large portion of our 2023 tractor capital is for replacement needs. We did repurchase some shares in the quarter and remain committed to be active in the market as opportunities arise. Finally, we moved the majority of our J.B. Hunt owned tractors out of our JBT segment into DCS. These trucks have consistently operated in a dedicated like manner for customers over many years and makes more strategic sense to be managed out of our DCS segment, while also allowing JBT to focus its efforts on scaling our J.B. Hunt 360 box service offering. Second, we moved our non-asset LTL business out of ICS and into Final Mile, which has similar operating characteristics as our Final Mile business. These realignments best position our organization for our future and focuses each segment's people and assets in particular areas of expertise. We have included an addendum in our earnings release to provide a historical perspective for these moves. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Nick. Yes. I think -- I don't want to draw too much attention to this, it was a little bit more of a reporting. And looking at our services, we felt like those as we talked about, we felt like those services -- could be better managed and/or more aligned in some of the different segments. And so that's why we made the move. We do feel like once in those segments, there can be some margin improvement there. But for the most part, it's more of an accounting and reporting issue to get those more aligned to where the other similar services are."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide some comments on our dedicated contract services and Final Mile segments, and also give an update on areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with dedicated. While demand for our professional outsourced private fleet solutions remain strong, we have seen some moderation in our pipeline of opportunities. That said, we sold approximately 200 trucks of new business in the first quarter and remain optimistic about hitting our target for the year. Our net truck adds in the quarter increased 426, but included trucks transferred from JBT. Excluding this, our net truck count increased 28 units in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, this number was influenced by the cleaning up of extra trucks held due to the age of our fleet and also partly driven by our CVD or customer value delivery process. This process optimizes fleets to manage costs for our customers as demand levels in their business change. This supports our 98% retention and our future growth opportunities. To a lesser extent, we did see some account closures in the quarter. Overall, we continue to carry momentum from our success over the last year, which drove revenue and operating income growth of 13% and 29%, respectively, in the quarter. Now on the Final Mile. As we discussed last quarter, demand for big and bulky products, including appliances, furniture and exercise equipment is soft, but this hasn't deterred us from our commitment to improving capability in this segment. Our efforts are focused on ensuring we are getting appropriately compensated for our high quality differentiated service product in the market. We continue to put business at risk during this renewal processes. And at this point, we remain pleased with our ability to retain business. This is, in my opinion, a testament to our service. Encouragingly, we are seeing some activity in the pipeline, but overall demand remains tempered in the segment. I'll close with some comments on safety. We continue to make significant investments in our training and new technologies to improve safety performance in our operations. As a result, we recently announced the rollout of inward facing cameras across our fleet to help address the distracted driving and other coachable activities with our driving workforce. This is a big step for our organization, follow our similar board moves in our history to lead in the area of safety, including [1996] (ph) increasing our pay package to attract experienced drivers, which resulted in a 50% reduction in DOT preventable accidents. In 2006, supplementing the DOT urine drug test with hair testing, which resulted in an 87% decrease in DOT post-accident positive rates. Then in 2011, rolling out forward collision warning systems which delivered nearly a 50% reduction in rear end accident frequency. In 2016, rolling out forward facing cameras with drove an 18% reduction in collision frequency per million miles. I am proud of our company's commitment to the safety of our employees and the motoring public. That concludes my remarks, so I'll turn it over to Darren. Yes, I'll take the safety question. We were faced with some challenges clearly in Q1, saw some last year. We had a tremendous growth. In the meantime, we have tremendous growth across the organization with new managers, new drivers. It presents some challenges to us. We're encouraged by the progress we're making. Still got a long way to go. In addition to that, the inward facing cameras, we're rolling that out. And so, we think that's going to -- well, we know it's going to take us another year and a half to two years to get fully implemented, but we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing there. So I would just say we're focused on it and we'll keep chipping away on our safety numbers. And we've seen good results so far at the end of Q1 from what we've seen."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I thought it made sense to talk about where we are as an organization and what we are working on to set us up for long-term success. More importantly, how this aligns with our 2023 priorities that I've previously shared, which are to: one, remain committed to disciplined long-term investments and our people, technology and capacity; two, deliver exceptional value to our customers; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. To start, we're in a challenging freight environment where there is deflationary price pressure for an industry that continues to face inflationary cost pressures. Simply stated, we're in a freight recession. As we have discussed, we believe we are in a position to deliver exceptional value for our customers by leveraging our full suite of services to deliver maximum efficiency and eliminate waste in the supply chain. We can do this by providing cost savings opportunities by converting on highway freight to intermodal, designing a highly engineered and efficient solution in our dedicated segment, leveraging vast amounts of market competitive capacity sourced on J.B. Hunt 360 or by providing best-in-class service as one of the largest final mile providers in North America. The strength and resiliency of our organization is supported by our mode neutral approach across all of our businesses and backed by our company foundation, which are, our people, technology, and capacity. And that's where we are today. So what are we working on? As we've committed to disciplined long-term investments in our people, technology and capacity, we admittedly have too much cost in our system right now for the current level of activity in our organization. And while we want to prudently manage our business in the near-term by focusing on controllable cost, more importantly, we remain focused on our long-term strategy to compound our growth at acceptable returns. As an organization, we have put greater emphasis in areas of our business by reallocating resources that will set us up to accelerate our growth and performance coming out of this current environment. One area in particular that has immense focus is in the area of safety. Also, as you might have noticed in our release, we moved pieces of our JBT and ICS segments into DCS and FMS segments respectively to best position the organization longer-term. While none of our businesses are immune to this environment, I am confident that there are great things happening in our business that set us up for long-term success. Remaining committed to our disciplined investments while prudently managing our cost is an area of focus for us across our organization. In closing, I want to say, we remain cautious on the outlook for the year. But remain confident in our ability to deliver value for our customers that will enable us to grow and take share through cycles, while maintaining discipline on our returns on capital. As I have stated previously, we will remain focused on the things we can control, but remain committed to managing our business for the long-term. As I look across our organization and see the experience and tenure of our team as a result of the investments made throughout our careers, I am confident in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Hey, Ken. I might add just a couple things to that. You know, we do see a low point of what's happening in spot. And from a capacity perspective, our evaluation of how cures can perform in this environment makes it very difficult for spot to go significantly lower. I'm not suggesting we've completely found the bottom, but we have seen a more leveling out, Brad, of what's happening in the spot market. So just from a capacity perspective, we estimate that they are losing money to breaking even at this point. It have been for a period of time. Typically, that can't last for a long period of time. So it'd be one note that I would say. And from an inventory perspective, we did spend a lot of time with our customers. I think they are struggling to really forecast what consumers are going to do. It's one of the reasons that we're more cautious on our outlook. Certainly, what Darren talked about on bid compliance, that's just an intermodal, JBT is similar. The brokerage side is even worse than that. So across all of our transactional businesses, I would say it's been very difficult for our customer to forecast. I think that's the reason we're not giving any more color as to what we think for the back half of the year. We can go off of their optimism and them wanting to purchase our services, but I think it's just a little more caution from us as to what the timing will be in total. Bascome, I would add to that. I think we're using our experience through the cycles to create more cautiousness in what we think on the timing for 2023. We have a lot of customers asking us those questions. I think they have a lot of optimism and they want things to improve. We don't have the data to help support some of that. So I think it's more of our experience that's having us have a slight change. I spoke earlier that we're less optimistic, but it is a timing issue more than anything. Thank you, Darren. And I do feel like our mission is to help our customers continue to take cost out of the supply chain. We've outlined how we can do that through all of our segments. But let me say, we've talked about thriving in any market. And this is a tough market, but there have been good fundamentals happening inside of our businesses. I think in the first quarter, you saw the resiliency of our dedicated contract services model. As they recorded a record quarter one to other quarter ones in both revenue and operating income and still continued demand from our customers in that segment. We're proud of the work that's happened in Intermodal and we have a healthy business model. We did a great job on our quality of revenue and continuing just maintain and stay within our margin targets, while having a lot of demand from our customers for our long-term. 360 box has grown in an environment that's had declining volumes in total signaling that our customers continue to want our services in those areas. We are very pleased with the progress, but yet want to continue to move forward in our Final Mile segment on improving our financial performance there. And finally, we are seeing some improved fundamentals as the quarter progressed and here coming into Q2 and ICS as they are carefully managing their cost in tech and people relative to what's happening in this environment. And while we're cautious on the timing of their recovery in this freight recession, we're going to focus on striking a balance between short term managing our costs, to more in line with current volumes, while being prepared and ready for long-term growth with our customers that will drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders.

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business in the quarter and reiterate the opportunities we have to deliver significant value to our customers with the investments we are making in our people, technology and capacity. I'll start by reviewing Intermodal's performance in the quarter. Demand for Intermodal capacity was tempered, driven by overall freight activity. But specifically lower imports and elevated inventory levels across the supply chain. Volumes in the quarter declined 5% year-over-year and by month were down 2% in January, down 4% in February and down 8% in March. As we stated in our earnings release, transcontinental volumes were down 9% in the quarter, but our Eastern volumes were up 1%. I think this is an important call out as we have been growing volumes in the East, which is the most truck competitive market, while being in a depressed truckload environment. This mix shift to shorter length of haul freight does influence contribution dollars per load which did impact us in the quarter, but also should signal our ability to deliver value to our customers in this market. Rail service predictability and consistency has improved to near pre pandemic levels, while customer detention of equipment improved even further and as the quarter progressed. While we have seen a decline in revenue associated with the detention of equipment, we have not yet offset that impact with the onboarding of new volume. As I've stated recently, our network and service offering is a coil spring that can handle significantly greater volume today and unlock a lot of value for our customers and our company. We have the people, the drake capacity, and the containers that could handle upwards of 15% to 20% more volume today. As we have shared recently, we have been meeting with customers and continue to be encouraged by the feedback we are receiving about our service. Customers trust us and our say/do culture. They believe in our Intermodal product and they want more of it, but part of that is influenced by the economy and overall freight demand. We feel very confident that we have a differentiated product in the market that will support our ability to take share. We are encouraged by the results we are getting so far in the bid process and look forward to the opportunity to prove the value we can deliver to our customers. In closing, we strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise and its opportunities to drive significant growth over many years. It provides significant value for our customers with opportunities to save money by converting freight from the highway to intermodal which reduces costs and is further supported by fuel costs and carbon emission savings. We are in the best position to commit more intermodal capacity to our customers as we progress further through the current bid season, which should present meaningful opportunities to unlock value in our network for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, so I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Yeah. So I'm not going to give any guidance on this call to be clear. I think we're encouraged by both and encouraged by both price and volume, meaning, I think we're winning volume that our customers believe that they will have. And encouraged by price in that, I don't think it's behaved any more challenging than what we expected coming into the year. Look, there's challenge on price, there's also cost to take out, part of the cost to take out comes with volume pouring over the top. And so, we're encouraged by the volume wins we have received on paper. We are -- we haven't seen all that volume yet. So there are, again, kind of like the last question still a handful of question marks out there. But I would say the bid season -- I remain optimistic about our future. There is going to [how many day] (ph) when imports improve from where they are. When will that be? I don't know the answer to that. But it will improve and we stand to gain tremendously when that happens. Well, number one, I'm not going to guide you on that second half of that question. I think as it relates to the equipment and storage, when we buy our equipment, we're buying it for the long-term. When we announced in March of 2022, a pathway to 150,000 containers over 3 years to 5 years, that's because the opportunity that presents itself to us for the long-term is significant. We did slow down onboarding equipment during the first quarter from the run rate we had been on in the back half of 2022. Velocity from our rail providers as well as customer unloading has unlocked a tremendous amount of capacity. And so, our opportunity to grow even while equipment is in storage remains intact and we have ample capacity do what we need with our customers. Look, in terms of the margin profile as we move forward, we continue to be confident in our ability to take cost out as we pour volume over the top. We have long-term margin targets that are not being changed, and we're confident in our ability to win and grow with our customers at acceptable returns. So listen, on the first -- on the fourth quarter call back in January, I did say I expect it to grow revenue loads and income. J.B. Hunt's growth company, that's our expectation around here every day, no matter what the conditions. That statement wasn't intended to be guidance, but clearly that's how it was interpreted. Again, as we go through the year, we're working with customers, talking to them about what their expectations are and that largely defines our own. And as we go through -- as we were coming into the year, we've probably had a lot of confidence in demand growth as 2023 went on. At this point, our customers have been less accurate than ever before. And so, we're still waiting to see what happens. As far as an update to that statement, I don't have an update for you. I know our system is built to handle 15% to 20% more as I said in my prepared comments and we look forward to growing with our customers through the rest of the year. And it is impressive how you guys get more than one question in. So bit compliance is sub 60, middle 50's. It's terrible. It's an all-time worst. So we'll see when that improves. Obviously, our transcontinental business is largely tied to imported goods and there's real significant challenge with bid compliance on that business is pretty poor. The cost takeout, one of the thoughts there has been, hey, we had weakness in velocity, so spreading the fixed cost of owning the equipment over more loads with better velocity is a cost takeout, but that comes with volume. We had driver productivity challenges as a result of poor rail service. And as rail service improves, we get stronger driver productivity and better utilization of our drayage assets. That's a cost takeout on per load economics. And then just staffing and overhead and how do we pour more loads over the system without adding overhead? And all of those actions are available to us that come with volume. Will we sustain the current op income per load? I don't have any idea. I know this that we're going to be happy with the return profile on our business. And our customers want more of our product, and I think that gives us an opportunity to price it fairly and anticipate a fair return for the work that we do. We must provide them an excellent customer service experience and we have to be good at communicating what their experience should be like, but I don't have any guidance on income per load. What I know is, we have a long-term margin target. We'll live within those boundaries and we expect that our return is going to be warrants reinvestment in our business. So I'll hit on intermodal on that question from a posture going into the bid cycle. I mean, we spent the better part of 2021 and 2022 without enough capacity to truly do everything that our customers wanted us to do caused by weakness in velocity, caused by slow unloading, slower rail service. And so, our posture in 2000 -- this bid cycle, in the 2023 bid cycle has just been to communicate with our customers that things are normalizing with our velocity and our capacity, we went out and acquired and announced publicly a mission to grow our capacity up to 150,000 containers in three to five years. And we're trying to really give our customers confidence that we're going to be there for them, that we're aware that costs had increased for them and that we felt like we could get some cost takeout by growing volume in our system. And so our approach has been to grow with our customers, but our approach is always to cover our investment with appropriate returns. And so, that's a balancing act. If you're asking, did we just set out to take share? We set out to grow because that's always our mission. That will be our mission next tomorrow and the next day and from here on forward. So that was our posture as we move into the bid season."

            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon. I'll touch on a few items, but will be brief with my comments as we have members of our leadership team here to cover specific areas of our business. As we have discussed, shifting dynamics in the market for several quarters now, it should be evident that freight demand is muted even when taking into account seasonal factors. As I stated last quarter, I believe this environment presents both opportunities and challenges for our company that will ultimately put us in a better position in the future. I am seeing, firsthand, how this team and might I add this experienced team is responding to set our company up for long-term success and compounding growth as we navigate through these demand patterns. We remain thoughtful in our approach to managing the business and controlling costs where it makes sense without sacrificing our preparedness to capitalize on large, meaningful and addressable opportunities for the company. We have and will always manage this business with a focus on long-term growth built on our company foundations, people, technology and capacity. In closing, I remain confident that the collective and complementary nature of our distinct business will again prove resilient in this environment, coupled with experience, a strong balance sheet and a long-term mindset, key elements which will continue to differentiate us in the market. We remain committed to investments and achieving our required return on those investments to support our long-term sustainable growth for the benefit of all our stakeholders. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our President, Shelley Simpson, for more details. Shelley? Yeah. So, throughout the quarter, I think we were successful in the bid cycle. And some of that volume hasn't really materialized. Our customers, throughout the quarter, did remain optimistic for stronger volumes in the second half of the year. We shared at multiple conferences that we are slightly less optimistic than our customers. The end of the day, our volumes and customer bid compliance is at an all-time low. And so that naturally creates some question marks. Our customers want more of what we do when they need it. Import volumes are clearly not strong. And so there is question marks out there about what will happen in the second half of the year. And so, as the quarter went on, I would say, we're slightly less optimistic. We've said that multiple times. Outside of that, I don't know what else to say other than I know our customers do want our capacity as soon as the import volumes return to normal. Hey, Justin. Well, I think the real question is the timing, Darren, said it. I talked to Shelley earlier today about the same idea that it's not really a question of if the freight demand will come back to normal. It's just really a question of when. And having the experience that we have around this table has really helped us position our thinking and our direction because we've been through freight cycles in the past. Some of us have been through quite a number of freight cycles in the past. And so, we know these times are coming. And if you look at what we've done with the company over the last maybe 10 years or so, every time we go through a cycle, we learn something about how our business runs up and then back down. And we have made very serious and intentional decisions about, for instance, how we place assets. You'll note that, I think Brad in your comments, we've transitioned essentially all of the power into dedicated where we can monitor it differently because we can see things in dedicated business model in a way that we like differently than we can sometimes see in a network mode. And so, if we look at where we are right now, and we think, oh well, maybe this timing we didn't quite get that right. That's going to be part of the reality that we live in. And because we have the experience and because the folks that are around this table have made mistakes and made good decisions, I think we're really just questioning how we -- how we time our reentry into a more normalized system. Now we are in leadership positions in many of our businesses. And our customers really appreciate that. We can handle scale. And so we don't want to lose any of that positioning value. I can say that right now, as we started to see the year presented itself a little differently than we had expected from our planning sessions, immediate action and intense focus has been taken on elements of cost. As Darren pointed out, we're running our playbooks through bids. I think Nick will comment on what his business looks like, what we're seeing in the world Highway Services. Those things are teaching us that we got to be a maybe a little bit more fluid. It's a word that Shelley used with me earlier today. And I am aware, of course, we're not going to speak of details, but I'm aware of many efforts and elements that are ongoing today that will really continue to help us stay healthy. While we get to that other side which we know is not a question of if it will present itself but when. So we just have to be patient and careful and thoughtful. Okay. I'll quickly touch on the storage fees [indiscernible] is really what I think you're getting at. We highlighted many times we're not going to break that out. I don't think that -- we've said before, don't over assume how much of a factor that is in terms of our income. Clearly customers are unloading faster. That revenue was down in the quarter year-over-year. And the results are the results. The cost takeout does come faster with volume [indiscernible] system. I'll let Nick come in on safety. Well, I mean, we highlighted negative two in January, negative four in February, negative eight in March. I think that we would normally anticipate our volumes to be improving year-over-year every month of the year. And then historically, the first quarter might actually trail the fourth quarter in terms of volume and then you build back up over the course of the year. And I would call that very normal that Q2 is growing over Q1, Q3 even over one and then four is going to be your strongest quarter, take a little step back in the first quarter of the next year and then keep growing. That is -- that's probably a 15 year historical view. That would be very normal. Right now when I go back to a year ago, volumes were really strong. I think the second quarter last year was probably our record volume quarter at any time in any year. And imports were strong and as the second half last year continued import flows began to change and so we'll have to see what that means this year. But as we move into the rest of the year, we do anticipate that we can get back on a growth trajectory, but we're also in a little bit of a wait and see and wait for customer to -- compliance to improve and demand particularly on the West Coast to improve. Well, I think there's a lot in that question. Mix of our business can play an enormous role and we highlighted that we were negative 9% transcon, plus 1% East. That's going to influence our overall revenue per load. Certainly, all of the factors you highlighted are part of it. In terms of the way we implement pricing, what we've highlighted multiple times is, we implement approximately 30% of our business in Q1, 30% in Q2, 30% in Q3 and 10% in Q4. Current cycle, so I don't know that it's any different than that. There's -- customers -- our ability to predict what's going on with that. I mean, Shelley just highlighted it. It's never been more challenging to know just what's going to happen with volumes. And I said earlier, I mean, the pricing market has largely behaved like we would have expected. And we expected some negative pressure on price. So I don't know how to give you any kind of further info on what to expect with price. I just know that certainly the impact of shorter length of haul and growth in the East more than transcon, once our transcon gets back to normal, you can expect that that would be helpful to the revenue per loan. Okay. Well, let me be very clear. I don't believe we're losing share in the West to a competitor. I feel very confident that our customers want our business. We'll have to prove it that we're taking share, but I feel very confident in our competitive environment against IMCs on the Union Pacific. Largely, the weakness in the West is almost purely related to the import economics. International Intermodal that comes in and goes intact is down, but so is just imports in general that feed warehouses throughout California and then create full truckload shipments out of there and the transload model. So all of that business is down. But I do expect and anticipate that J.B. Hunt is growing share in all markets in Intermodal. Well, I mean, I don't know that we anticipated strength or rebound in imports in Q1. When we talk about what might have gradually changed over the course of the quarter, again, it was that compliance and just continued uncertainty from our customers about what the consumer was going to do and what order would be like. I think we felt that a lot in the first quarter as we met with customers and you could see as time went on their ability to forecast and even know what to expect, we had questions and that's what has created our change to some degree. What do we need to happen? We need imports to improve. We need a West Coast labor agreement to finalize and give customers confidence in the West Coast to import programs more than anything we need in the economy and the goods economy to improve. That will drive the fastest response and inventories to bleed off. Thanks for that question. We've had -- we've been talking about and looking at our sales compared to last year and last year was just terrific and our sales have slowed down a touch. But we're very optimistic when we look in the pipeline. And we're starting to see some of our customers really ask some questions on some private fleets that we're working on to really take out cost and using our engineering resources to really not just put out a procurement bid, but really how can we do things more efficient since their volume was down. So we're encouraged by that. So I would say we still will hit our targets. We feel comfortable hitting our sales targets that we lay out every year. So we're optimistic. Our volumes in general are okay, I would say, in Dedicated. So we're continuing to go to the stores and all the things that we do on a consistent not robust, but we have a lot of interest from a lot of different customers looking for us to help them with some solutions to take out cost. And we think that plays into our strength very nicely. I would say we're clearly seeing some weakness when it comes to building and construction, it's where we're seeing some stuff and we kind of look at it by industry kind of on the [indiscernible] side around that. But overall, I would just say, when I say it's slowing down, we're seeing decisions. We've got a lot of stuff out there waiting decisions on it. Our customers are a little more skittish on making decisions, trying to figure out what's happening with their core business. And we've seen more decisions in the last couple of weeks pick up from what we've seen the previous month. So hopefully that's a little bit a lot in our area, but we feel very optimistic about it. Well, I'll start with Highway. We've been very public in our desire to grow our published volumes in particular in ICS. We have had success in doing that, not enough at this point to offset the overall decline in freight demand. And I will highlight that we did see growth inside of our 360 box offering in the quarter, double digit growth and so very satisfied with the trajectory and the growth of that particular product offering for our customers. And so, we have largely met our bid goals. However, as mentioned numerous times, not just in intermodal, but in all of our transactional businesses, the bid compliance from our customers is at an all-time low. And so we really yet to see or feel the benefit of those wins at this point in time. And obviously, as mentioned, we don't have really a good crystal ball as to if -- not so much if, but when they will recover it? Thanks, Shelley. I'll just close this by saying that, as we look at this turbulence, we are very confident in our structure overall, our asset structure for each business makes sense to us in a way that it hasn't always for me. And I think we finished a lot of the work coming into 2023 that needed to be done. So that things like 360 box could have a chance to get that traction. It's looking for as a very unique and we think very needed service. I'm thankful that we asked a question here about Dedicated, although it did take 50 minutes of the hour call to get to it. Because I think we're again reminding everyone that that's a very different business than I think what is it is interpreted as. And in this tough climate where you see radical changes in some of our channel demand, you see a real steady state, a very resilient business that is asset intense, but also has a very different rate and contract structure that we are the industry leader at providing. And I think when we take it up to return on invested capital, we look at the performance of margins in intermodal at this point. We look at the performance and all of the businesses that do require more capital, that's why I say I think we're in a better position than we've ever been in. Shelley talked about responding to the market signals, the market changes. Right now, we are doing that. And I think there is a very, very quick response at this level with this team to address challenges that are weren't expected necessarily. But with the most important part of that conversation being about the long-term, we are a long-term company. Our addressable market is somewhere in the high hundreds of billions of dollars. And so, when we say we're a growth company, that's because as industry leaders, we have fractional percentages of the markets that we serve even in the number one spot. So we like where we're at. We have a strong view. We will make tweaks. Remember on CapEx, when you think about that, a good portion of our CapEx is replacement. We had plenty of trouble through the pandemic in getting equipment replaced that we needed. I think we will look at timing on other elements of CapEx expansion and growth. And with DCS, that model is a pull system anyway. So it only triggers being our heaviest demand when it is asked to or after a deal is closed. So I think that that all goes back to the idea of probably more cautious about the rest of this year than we were three months ago to that question based on the facts and data that we're seeing. And we will respond, but we know this. Last point, it's not a question of yes, this is coming back. It's just a question of when and what position will we be in when our customers start ringing our phone again in ways that they have in the past. Thank you for calling in today."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brad Delco, Senior Vice President of Finance. You may begin.\nBrad Delco: Good afternoon. Before I introduce the speakers, I would like to provide some disclosures regarding forward-looking statements. This call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on J.B.

For more information regarding risk factors, please refer to J.B. Hunt's Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now, I would like to introduce the speakers on today's call. This afternoon, I am joined by our President and CEO, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Spencer Frazier, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; our COO and President of Contract Services, Nick Hobbs; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services and Executive Vice President of People. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. First, our thoughts are with those impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast and Florida. Many of our employees were impacted, and I'm proud of how our company has responded to support them and the recovery and relief efforts in these communities. The rebuilding will take time and J.B. Hunt will continue to support these efforts. Turning to the quarter. We continue to navigate a challenging freight environment while remaining focused on what we can control around our costs, providing exceptional service to our customers, preparing for their future transportation needs and maintaining our focus on safety. As discussed last quarter, we have seen a return to more normal seasonal demand patterns as evidenced across our businesses in the third quarter, which the team will highlight in their remarks. I remain confident in our strategy as we execute on our priorities, which as a reminder are; one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, scale our long-term investments in our company foundations, which are people, technology, and capacity; and three, drive long-term value and returns for our shareholders. Our focus remains on how we can deliver value for our customers with excellent service while looking for ways to drive waste out of their supply chain. We do have some more positive signs in the business to support our work in this area, particularly around our volume trends, customer awards, and third-party surveys that highlight J.B. Hunt's performance. I see more evidence today that we can scale our investments in our people, technology, and capacity to capture additional market share at better returns as the freight cycle inflection occurs. I remain confident in our strategy and maintain our focus on generating appropriate returns on capital to deliver value for our shareholders. As we prepare for an eventual churn in the freight market, we have focused our organization on being operationally excellent and delivering unmatched value for our customers. By controlling what we can right now, we position ourselves to grow with our customers, knowing that these key service components are ingrained in our people. At the same time, we know we need to repair our margins to generate acceptable returns to reinvest in the business and our customers are and should be aware of that as well. We take great pride in providing high-quality service in all that we do, which is a testament to the dedication that our people have to serve customers well. Creating value for our customers is core to what we do and helps build long-term strategic relationships. Customer Value Delivery or CVD is a process that we have used for a while in our dedicated business and we continue to roll this out across our entire organization. Part of the value we create is through our safety culture and performance, which is the strength of our business and we have continued to improve upon last year's record performance as Nick will discuss. The team will provide more details on each of our businesses, but in summary, I continue to have strong conviction around our strategy and the growth potential of our company. We have and we will continue to prove our ability to deliver outperformance for our people, our customers and our shareholders. Our confidence comes from our people, our experience, our complementary suite of services, our scale, our strategic investments and our financial strength. All of these uniquely position us for the future as we pursue our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to recent quarters, my comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter, an update on our cost control efforts, and an update on our capital allocation plan for the remainder of 2024. As a general overview, while we have seen some slight moderation in inflationary cost pressures, the deflationary rate environment continues to pressure our overall margin performance across the segments. Let me start with a quick review of the third quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to the prior year period, revenue declined 3%, operating income declined 7% and diluted earnings per share decreased 17%. We saw our volumes on a sequential basis outperform normal seasonality, particularly in JBI, but also in our Highway Services business, which includes both ICS and JBT. That said, overall yield pressure in these areas continue to put pressure on margins and our overall profitability. We continue to focus on productivity, efficiency, and discretionary cost areas to enhance our performance across all of our businesses. We believe this is evidenced and supported by what we believe to be industry-leading margin and return performances in our two largest segments, both Intermodal and Dedicated. Going forward, for the full year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, which should imply a decent step-down in our fourth quarter tax rate compared to the prior three quarters. To update on our cost control efforts, we have made significant improvements across the business to right-size our cost structure, mostly evidenced in our Highway Services businesses as both JBT and ICS improved their operating margins compared to the prior year period. We remain thoughtful in our approach to managing our costs, focusing on controlling what we can in the near term without jeopardizing our ability to support future growth and our aggregate earnings power potential. Our focus on cost has been broad-based and covers the entire span of our company. Wrapping up with an update to our 2024 capital plan, we now expect our net capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $625 million, which is below our previously revised expectation of $650 million to $700 million. Our update from the prior quarter largely reflects the sale of all the chassis that we acquired from Walmart, which will not fit the containers we purchased following our retrofitting of those assets. The sale reduces the net purchase price of those assets and gives us even greater confidence in the strategic value of that transaction for our customers and importantly, our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of stock. With limited near-term capital needs with regards to equipment, our current leverage position, market dynamics and our view on where we are in the cycle, we continue to believe a disciplined approach to share repurchases is a prudent use of capital at this time. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Spencer.\nSpencer Frazier: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on the market, our commercial strategy and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of more normal seasonal demand patterns, particularly across our Intermodal and Highway segments. In JBT and ICS, we experienced modestly improving volume trends and some pockets of tightness across the country, which would or should be expected around the month-end and quarter-end. While in general, capacity remains readily available in the market on the highway side of the business, some customers are beginning to use more mini bids to fill some out-of-cycle capacity needs. Additionally, there is interest in having more collaborative long-term planning discussions around business strategies. Historically, both of these engagements have been indicative that supply and demand are becoming more imbalanced. When we have conversations with customers around their transportation needs, we highlight the value our [Indiscernible] services can present and focus on excellence to ensure all of our customer needs are being met. Our goal is to achieve the top ranking on each of our customers' service provider scorecards. With some customers, we've achieved our goal, while with others, we have some opportunities to improve. Through our mode-neutral sales strategy, we work with our customers to develop the optimal solution for their needs with our people leveraging our full suite of services and technology to create value. We believe this is a clear differentiator for J.B. Hunt in the market. Our focus is on providing the best customer experience with every interaction we have while living up to our say-do culture. We know that excellent service the first time leads to opportunities for future growth across our customer supply chain and we are committed to achieving both. I'll close with some feedback we are hearing from customers. First, we are beginning to execute the peak season plans we developed with our customers. While some volumes were pulled forward into Q3, we also incurred more peak season start-up costs to pre-position resources to serve our customers' peak demand in Q4. Secondly, each customer, regardless of size and industry is unique. Within our diverse portfolio, our customers are somewhat mixed on the outlooks for demand for their products and what their transportation needs will look like in the near-to-medium term. While that is their view on the market, we believe we are in a strong position to take share based on the value we can create for our customers with our people, technology, and most importantly, our consistent service levels. Lastly, as we sit here today, capacity is not a top concern for customers, but they are aware that the current market dynamics will shift, though the timing and rate of change remains uncertain. Customers are also aware that there has been significant cost inflation across our industry and margins are under pressure. With these knowns, we will continue to work with them to help drive efficiencies across their supply chain while balancing our need to repair our margins. We remain committed to investing in our business and growing with our customers over the long term by delivering consistent value at the high service levels they've come to expect from J.B. Hunt. That concludes my remarks. So, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Our Dedicated business model is focused on providing professional outsourced private fleet solutions to our customers performed well during the quarter. We believe the resiliency and performance in this segment stands out in the market and supports our differentiated model and go-to-market strategy. While we have discussed some pressure on the fleet size due to customer downsizing, bankruptcies, and as a result of remaining disciplined on our underwriting return hurdles, we believe the market remains stable with ample opportunities for future growth. During the third quarter, we sold 258 trucks of new deals with some we expected to sign in Q3, spilling over into Q4 due to timing. Our sales pipeline remains strong and our team has worked hard to backfill most of those truck losses we have experienced this year. We have started up a significant number of customer locations and trucks over the past two quarters, which has had an impact on our margins as mature business has been replaced by newer, less mature business. That said, we remain disciplined on new customer wins and are confident that this new business will generate both appropriate margins and more importantly, returns on capital once they ramp to maturity. Going forward, we expect new account gross sales to remain stable within our long-term stated range of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks on an annualized basis, but keeping in mind, growth in operating income typically lags fleet growth by a few quarters. Shifting to Final Mile. We have made significant progress to improve the overall health of our business focusing on high-quality service and revenue quality while remaining cost-disciplined through the process. We have seen the market for big and bulky delivery evolve with customers looking for high-quality service providers with national scale and strong safety standards. Overall, demand for big and bulky products remained somewhat challenged with continued soft demand for furniture and modestly soft trends in exercise equipment and appliances. While we remain encouraged by our sales pipeline and continue to engage in discussions with new brands, we have seen some customer churn, which impacted top-line and bottom-line performance in the quarter. Our focus remains on providing the highest service level as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customer with a priority on being safe and secure. We will remain disciplined with potential new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service, while we work to grow the business and improve profitability. Going forward, while we are encouraged by the improvement in our Final Mile business this year, we remain focused on growing the business profitably with the right customers that recognize the value we provide. Similar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety. Our Company is rooted in a foundation of safety for not only our people, but also the motoring public, and we continue to invest in training and equipment to enhance our already strong safety culture. In 2023, we had a record performance in terms of DOT-preventable accidents per million miles. And so far year-to-date, I am pleased to say we have improved further. I am also pleased to announce that we hit our previously stated goal of being 100% roll-out with inward-facing cameras in our trucks by the end of the third quarter. These cameras are just one of many innovative safety initiatives we have rolled out that continues to contribute to our safety culture and performance. As you are aware, the cost of claims have elevated, but we continue to manage and mitigate risk by remaining focused on our safety performance. This concludes my remarks, so I would like to turn the call over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. Let me start with a review of Intermodal's performance during the quarter. Overall, we saw the momentum from the second quarter accelerate into the third quarter as our overall volume was up 5% year-over-year, which modestly outperformed normal seasonality. The volume growth during the third quarter was driven by 7% growth in Transcon with Southern California outbound volumes up double-digits once again this quarter and 3% growth in the East. By month, our consolidated volumes were up 7% in July, up 4% in August, and up 4% in September. In the East, we continue to compete more directly with one-way truckload, but as evidenced by our overall volume improvement this quarter, we are beginning to win back small amounts of freight from customers due to our strong service levels and ability to meet their capacity needs. As we look to our bid warehouse, we continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal as it is more economical and environmentally friendly. We stand ready and have the capacity and people in place to meet and exceed our customer service needs both now and in the years ahead. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure year-over-year and despite a modest improvement in margins sequentially, we did incur additional expenses in the third quarter. You've heard me say that right now, volume means more to us than it has ever before and that remains true. However, pricing has been and is still the biggest lever to improve margins. While we did see sequential volume growth, we absorbed additional expense during the quarter to keep our network fluid in light of the imbalances caused by the strength in our networks, specifically out of Southern California. We are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing in customers' bid compliance, which will provide us better opportunities in the future to fill in lane imbalances and drive greater efficiencies in the network. Going forward, and as a reminder, we implemented the remaining pricing from our 2024 bid season during the third quarter. And given the nature of our pricing cycle, we will be living with a large portion of current pricing through the first half of 2025. We just kicked off our 2025 bid season and we do like our position given our service levels and ability to handle customer surge demand that we have been experiencing. We continue to see truckload pricing that we believe is unsustainable over the long term, particularly in the Eastern network. We have recently seen some shippers look to convert small amounts of freight from truck to rail in the East, which we are encouraged by and highlights our service and value proposition that we and our rail providers are able to provide. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service levels from each of them, their commitment to the Intermodal offering in growing the overall market. That said, we and our railroad providers know the true test of our collective service will come once freight volumes increase with higher overall demand on our networks. We have been in constant dialogue with them that this peak could serve as one of many proven moments to show customers that we collectively can handle significant growth while maintaining proper service. Maintaining service during periods of stronger demand like we are experiencing today supports the case for Intermodal growth and additional conversion from over-the-road freight. Our conviction in the strength of our Intermodal franchise hasn't wavered. Our customers trust us, our service levels are exceptional, and our optimism on the future growth of our Intermodal business hasn't changed. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive with pressure on both volume and rate. That said, I am encouraged by some of the progress we have made to stabilize trends in the business. Segment gross revenue declined 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by a 10% decline in volume, partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue per load. Sequentially, ICS volume increased 2% as our efforts to diversify and strengthen our customer base are starting to yield results. While we continue to focus on quality revenue and growing with the right customers, we have also made strides to right-size the cost structure of our business, especially in our legacy ICS business. Segment gross margins were high at 17.9% for the quarter, highlighting our disciplined bid strategy, effective sourcing and was also aided by some project-related work. We continue to make progress on our costs and better aligning our resources with our current business levels. In the quarter, we did incur some additional expense related to the integration of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics, which had an approximately $2 million negative impact on our operating expenses in the quarter as compared to the second quarter. Going forward, we will remain focused on further diversifying our customer base, continuing to right-size our cost structure and leveraging our technology to scale growth. We will need to scale the business with more volume on the platform to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability. Moving over to JBT or Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 12% year-over-year, driven by a 6% decrease in volume and a 6% decrease in revenue per load. Our focus remains on attracting the right freight that best fits our network while ensuring that our capacity is positioned in the right markets to meet customer needs. We've seen customer bid compliance improve throughout the year, which allows us to better plan our capacity, which provides efficiency across our network and has contributed to the improved profitability in our JBT business. Our service levels have been very strong and at the highest level since the shift to our power-only model, J.B. Hunt's 360box in 2019. Our high service levels, combined with the flexibility of the drop trailer network, position us well for future growth with new and existing customers. Going forward, we continue to expect to see some pressure on volumes. That said, I am confident in the network discipline that we have and the growth opportunities in front of us as we head into the 2025 bid season. I'll close with some comments on 360. Technology is foundational to our company and is the piece that connects and empowers our people to the available capacity we have to serve our customers. A lot of the significant investments into the foundations of our platform have been complete. That said, we continue to leverage this foundation into new market opportunities. For example, rolling out the platform to the agents we acquired from the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics and also to the SMB and LTL markets, while also improving cargo security in our business. We continue to believe our technology investments will drive greater productivity and efficiency gains across this goal and better position us for long-term growth with our customers. This concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Wow. Great. Appreciate being upfront. And I guess, Shelley, you would cut me off if I asked on November 16th how many points Texas will win by. So I will not ask that. You noted normal intermodal patterns, but I guess looking at how much was pulled forward, can you estimate how much was -- the results were aided by the pull forward? And Darren, you noted business is strong now, I guess given the post-hurricanes catch-up from strike, or is this just the peak season improvement? I'm wondering if we see the slowdown faster because of those earlier shipments. I know a lot in there, but I'm trying to understand the impact of the pre-shipping.\nDarren Field: Sure. So, Ken, appreciate the question. I'm sure Spencer might have some thoughts as well. Look, as we went into peak season planning, we communicated with all of our customers and looked for as much of their advice as we could get and prepared our plans. We certainly know that there were customers that were shifting business back to the West Coast from the East because it fit their network well. We had customers shifting freight from the East back to the West because of fears of a potential labor strike on the East Coast. We had customers talking about a pull forward just from a preparedness and an overall capacity standpoint. And we had many, many customers that said normal peak. So I think that the results are really in terms of a mixed bag, in terms of how much was pulled forward, we don't really know. I don't want to tell you that none of it was. Some of it was certainly pulled forward. We do have a lot of customers that continue to expect a normal peak as we go through the fourth quarter. So we do anticipate continued demand for our services and we'll all kind of have to wait and see if it's a faster pull down. But at this point, I think we're expecting things to behave what we consider normal. Spencer, I don't know if you have some thoughts you'd like to share there.\nSpencer Frazier: Yes, Darren, thanks for that. And Ken, appreciate your question. A couple of things. Just regarding the port strike in the East, as Darren mentioned, our customers really deployed a handful of different strategies. Some of that was a little bit of a shift to the West. Some of it maybe pulled some inventory in ahead of that strike, and others had a wait-and-see approach. And when we sit here right now, I'd say we've got a couple weeks for those East Coast ports to really normalize their flows. But something to consider is this deadline just got extended to January 15th. And so the plays that they ran leading up to this event are now probably going to be rerun as we look forward into January. And then also, I'd say a couple of other things just around peak and peak demand. I want to give our customers a lot of credit for the work that they've done as their demand has normalized, as well as their inventories have normalized with their forecast, the capacity needs from J.B. Hunt. They've done a better job of that, I think. Brad and Darren both mentioned that our bid compliance numbers have improved. We're happy to see that. And then also as we think about peak going forward, we're still in active conversations to make sure we continue to position our people to successfully execute peak along with our capacity over the next several weeks, so our customers can have a great finish to the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe a little bit more on the peak season. You mentioned a little bit of project freight coming back. I think that was Brad on the ICS side. So broadly on rail service, how is it performing out of the West? It seems like you have a pretty good ability to move a tremendous amount of volume, but how has that performed in with the new COO, I guess, consulting for them, Ed Harris for BNSF, do you expect any changes here in the short term or the medium term as he looks to take a closer look at those operations? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Okay, Brian, your phone kind of broke up there, but I think I know the gist of it. Just for -- our Western provider, we continue to be engaged at all levels of our organization in terms of how can we be more efficient and stronger together when we solve problems together. I'm aware that Ed Harris being assigned as a consultant to BNSF has created a handful of questions. It's our understanding that he's really focused on their merchandise network. I would say this, BNSF is the largest intermodal provider and moves the densest intermodal business, serving the fewest nodes in the intermodal industry. That density is very much in line with all things PSR. Now, I'm not saying they're a PSR railroad. It's just -- they didn't have to do that. There's a lot of attention to intermodal at BNSF in terms of their growth channel. And we're convinced that there is no changes coming to our business in the coming months or years. There's no deviation from their strategy to grow intermodal. We're very encouraged by their commentary. If anything, improvement in their merchandise network could positively influence intermodal service. We'll wait and see. That's not an area of their business that we stay focused on. But we're assured by the BNSF that PSR is not a strategy at BNSF. I don't know if Shelley wanted to make a comment on that or not.\nShelley Simpson: No, I think Darren said it well. I would just say, for us, we're very focused on expanding the intermodal market together. So both J.B. Hunt and BN are thinking about how do we launch for customers around intermodal and expanding emerging markets, like things we've done with Quantum and what we're doing with Mexico. We're continuing those conversations. I would say anything that happens from a merchandising perspective would roll over into J.B. Hunt and should benefit us as well.\nBrad Delco: And then Brian, I think you may have been put on mute. This is Brad, but you asked a question about project-related business. I'll let Brad Hicks respond to that.\nBrad Hicks: Yes, Brian. We had some of that start in the second quarter and we'll certainly have project business that will carry into Q4. Some of that is seasonal work that we do on behalf of our customers. Otherwise, there's small pockets where our customers have needs, where we want to make sure that we're the right partner and service them at a level that we can continue to be that first call when they have those extra needs. I really think that the key element there is just how proud we are of the improvement that we've seen in ICS in particular. The gross margins in the quarter were very healthy and I think that that's representative of the foundational work that we've been focused on all year around quality of revenue and the right type of business, and certainly, our teams have done a great job executing throughout the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, I was hoping you can help understand the sequential increase in revenue per load. I know it wasn't gigantic, but it did go up, your East went up 3% in 3Q versus down 7%. So, conceptually, there should have been a mixed headwind there. You've been telling us all along to kind of bake in that 30% bid season from 1Q, 2Q, and 3Q. So, just felt like with everything that you just posted from a mix perspective that revenue per load would have been down sequentially. So, how did you manage that up? And then I guess, how do we think about your comments about being fully baked into the middle of '25? Does that mean kind of flat from here or is there any improvement potential?\nDarren Field: Okay. Well, on the revenue per load, I mean the mix -- the mix results in the quarter were -- our length of haul was actually longer in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter and there was sequential pricing pressure certainly that played a role in those results. I lost a little piece of your question there. I just know that, as we've gone through the year and implemented new pricing, none of us are satisfied with where we're at in terms of the returns on our business. We still believe that the pathway to help for us is to execute on behalf of our customers, make sure that we're doing what we say we're going to do, and deliver value to our customers so that when the world changes, we're prepared and in a good position to talk about the quality of our service, the challenges we have from a cost standpoint and recover some of our margin through pricing efforts. That's -- that will continue to be our focus and we'll wait and see how that plays out as we move into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi. Question on Dedicated. Can you maybe give an update a bit on the overall general competitive environment for new business? And also, I've been hearing some thoughts that private fleets, shippers themselves have been adding their own trucks over the last year or two and maybe that's impacting some of the over-the-road guys. I'm just curious if you've heard that and if so, does that make it tougher maybe to sign in and close some of the deals on the Dedicated front? Thanks.\nSpencer Frazier: All right. Thanks, Jordan. Yes, I'll talk about that a little bit. I have been reading a lot about competition in the Dedicated market as well. But what we're seeing in the marketplace and where we're focused on really private fleet replacement, we're not seeing any unusual competition out there, I would say, and what we're really targeting, we love our pipeline. We love the success we've had. We're remaining disciplined in our pricing margins and so, we feel very good about that. We're -- I see a lot of the competition and hear about a lot of it is more in the retail, dry van kind of drop and hook, more commoditized. And we have a little bit in there, but not a lot. But just looking at the names that we've been awarded in the last week, you probably wouldn't recognize three or four of the names in there, the private fleets that we've taken over. So, we feel good about that. Now from private fleets, I would say, yes, some of the large private fleets are growing and that's fine. But if I look at the market, $60 billion to $80 billion to $90 billion that we have qualified, we still feel very good about where we're going and our sales targets. So, I read a lot about the competition and we see some, we've lost some business with our trucks. But overall, I feel very good that with our disciplined pricing approach, we can still be very, very successful.\nBrad Delco: Jordan, this is Brad Delco. I do want to add, I mean, Nick in his prepared comments talked about the performance of that business. And I think when you look at the performance of the business both in terms of how well revenue in trucks and certainly operating income and margins has held up relative to a lot of the peers set, and I mean, I do think it's a differentiated model that's supported by that performance and hopefully that's recognized by those on the call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Hi, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking our questions. Darren, on the Intermodal margin side, those held in, I think nicely and better than expected given the pricing pressure this year. Can you maybe just talk through the puts and takes of the sequential step-up in the margin? And then from a pricing standpoint, maybe Spencer can add color too, but you're going into this upcoming bid season with more excess capacity than historically. So, maybe in a year that didn't go as well this year, strategically, how are you thinking about driving volume growth versus holding the line on price and just the strategy going into that bid season given the excess capacity we're in now?\nDarren Field: Okay. Well, on the sequential margin, at the end of the day, volume, we've said before, volume has meant more to us today than ever before. It still isn't more valuable than the role that pricing would play. When pricing can turn, you can see that impact margin quicker. Certainly, velocity on our system can play a role. When we pick up volume, there's efficiencies we gain inside of our drayage operation or there's certainly a lot of opportunity to grow. A load out of Southern California is not the same as a load going back to Southern California. So, the mix of the traffic that operates in the third quarter versus second quarter is very different and the result of the margin is what it is. As we go into the next year, and like I said earlier in the call, I mean we're not satisfied with our returns. We believe that carriers are operating at rates below their cost. We think they're unsustainable. We're surprised by the longevity and how long it has lasted. We also have been wrong in the past when we believed that the pricing market was about to turn and we could get rates up and I would even say at this point last year, probably I'm not sure I said it, but I probably did believe that a year ago today and I would have been wrong. And so, as we go into the bid season, we're focused on delivering value to our customers, talking about the capacity answers that we have, also talking about the cost challenges we face, talking about how we're prepared to serve their needs in a host of ways and that's at the enterprise-level. And so, as we go into this bid cycle, we're going to continue that process because the experience in this room has taught us that that's the best approach.\nSpencer Frazier: Yes. And Darren, I'll add, Daniel, you kind of wanted to know a little bit about where we're at with customers in our conversations. And I would say this, they're in their bid and budgeting process right now. And in that, they're challenged to operate their supply chain and find ways to do that in the most efficient way possible. And they also know, as Darren just said, the costs in our industries have been rising dramatically and the margins are not sufficient. But when we have those conversations with our customers, really we are very transparent in the cost-to-serve them while working with them to design optimal solutions across their network. And ultimately, we're leaning on the consistently high service levels that drive value and find a match for that value for both companies. And ultimately, that's going to set them up, set our teams up for success, and hopefully improve our returns in the process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, pretty dramatic improvement in the broker -- ICS gross margin in the quarter. Any thoughts, is that the market? Is that in your mind more specific to you and how sustainable is that? And then just separately, I think the last couple of years in Q4, we've had some pretty big insurance accruals just catch-up. Any color on how to think about that in Q4 this year?\nBrad Delco: Yes. Hi, Scott. I'll start with your first question and then I'll maybe throw it to John Kuhlow for the second part there. The gross margin percent that we see in Q3, I think is unique to J.B. Hunt and the focus and the work that we've been trying to accomplish. Now we will see when some others release, but certainly against what we were seeing in earlier quarters of the year, that feels like it's unique to us. And I really do think it's a testament to the type of freight that we're going after, the customers and the value that we're providing to our customers as well as the execution of our business in terms of our purchasing and leveraging our technology through J.B. Hunt 360 and I think that those have all come together for us in a unique way in Q3. Now, we have seen more recently disruption with the back-to-back hurricanes in the Southeast and Florida, as Shelley mentioned at the opening comments. And so we see little things happening there that can have the potential to put pressure on us. But we also saw that a little bit leading into the fourth of July and then it loosened back up for us in terms of the book of freight that we have. So, I do feel like we're capitalizing and trying to maximize what that could be for us. And I'm really proud of the great work that the team has done.\nShelley Simpson: Hi, Scott, it's Shelley. I might just add, we don't model and aren't modeling for a 17%-plus margin that's historically very high for the market. So, I would say anything in the average of 14% to 15% would be more norm. And so there have been some things that ICS has done and some key customers that they're working closely with and I think that's yielded some improvement here in third quarter and we'll see what happens here moving forward.\nJohn Kuhlow: And Scott, this is John Kuhlow, and actually I thought maybe Shelley was going to take the insurance question. Yes. So, to your point, we did -- over the last couple of years, we had some more significant charges in various quarters for our insurance. That was a little bit more of circumstances around the dramatic increases in where some of these settlements were going and as it was layered against our insurance structure at the time and so, I do feel like we've made a lot of good progress in going through our claims, working with our actuaries and our attorneys, and feel like we're in a good spot with respect to our insurance accruals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I just want to follow up on the BNSF commentary. I think you said that you don't expect anything to materially change, but so are you saying that you don't think they're going to do PSR at all? And if they did, does that change your go-to-market strategy with them in any way? Thanks.\nBrad Delco: Well, first of all, Ravi, yes, you heard us loud and clear. I don't believe BNSF is implementing PSR. They are certainly engaged with us for decades now in how can we be more efficient and more effective together. Now that we are largely the only channel at BNSF, I would say that that dialog has ramped up to another gear. And together, we work together on how can we drive efficiency for each other. But most importantly, BNSF listens to us talk about what our BCOs need and want from the market. And we feel like that is very different than what we have experienced from railroads implementing PSR. Certainly, the way that they listen to what BCOs want and need has us very encouraged and we're certain at all levels at BNSF, we have their commitment that PSR is not part of their strategy. Growing their Intermodal business is part of their strategy. All that being said, their margin isn't what they want it to be, our margin isn't what we want it to be. So, together, we have to deliver excellence in our service execution and we have to go repair each other's margins together in the market and we stand ready to do that with our customers just as soon as that is possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. I'm going to ask a question on Intermodal. I hope that's okay with you, Brad. You've had a pretty good mix of questions on others. But let's see. If I can go back to the comment, Darren, on normal peak season. When you say normal, is that normal seasonal kind of 4Q versus 3Q? Is it normal year-over-year? Like I don't -- I guess it still seems like they're probably looking at the container imports would have been some strength that wouldn't continue. So, I don't know if there's a way to put a little more on that. Maybe another way to look at it would be, if you go back over time and say, hey, sometimes there are reasons why customers shipped more in terms of imports in June, July, August versus a bit later, October, November. So, I just wonder if you could kind of look back on historical and maybe offer a little more on how you think about normal in terms of Intermodal volumes.\nBrad Delco: Well, when I said normal, I would say that the sequential changes that we go from Q2 to Q3 to Q4 and the way our dialogue has gone with our customers in terms of what their expectations are, what their forecasts are, and the accuracy in which they forecast their needs. All of those have returned to what we would call normal pre-pandemic levels. We have -- we don't have customers telling us, hey, we're going to have a much weaker demand during the fourth quarter than what we told you just a month ago. None of that is going on today. Again, I'm not going to break down for you how many customers told us they did move, pull some forward, some did. But I don't think it's this overwhelming market story for us. It certainly has been a factor. I don't want to ignore it. But at the same time, we expect our volumes in the fourth quarter to continue to be strong demand from Southern California. The import volumes and the way that imports flowed into the West Coast ports throughout the summer, that didn't translate to an Intermodal market. There are warehouses with inventory in them built for peak-season shipping on the West Coast. And so, we do feel like this is what I would consider normal. I don't know that I've defined it the way you want me to, but that's the way I'm going to define it today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes, hi, thanks. Good afternoon. So, I guess, Darren, you had noted a couple of things that I thought were interesting. The first was the comment about some Eastern loads potentially moving over from truck competition. So, I guess I wanted to get a sense of maybe what you were seeing there and what you think were the driving factors given the pricing environment that's been persistent for a while there. I guess in the -- and the second piece of it, I guess, when you think about costs as well, I think there's some repositioning or some positioning costs related to the strong growth off of the West Coast. Is that something that we think sticks around for an extended period or maybe until the boxes on the sidelines start to get drawn down more? I'm just kind of curious how you think about the durability of that type of cost.\nDarren Field: Okay. All good questions, Chris. So, certainly, let me let me touch on the empties first. So, I don't know how to call it durable, whether it's going to stick or not. The balance of Southern California is inbound and outbound. There certainly is an uptick in demand for the Eastbound volume coming off the West Coast, whereas there's not necessarily an uptick in demand for Westbound flows. If the need to support capacity in Southern California sustains at the kind of new ratio today that we're experiencing now, then certainly that has to find its way into the economics with the customers. And I don't think that will completely surprise our customers, but it certainly is a factor as we move forward. I think that in 2024, it's a little more visible because the growth opportunity that we saw off the West Coast was stronger than it was in the East. So, it's sort of getting a little bit extra spotlight on the demand for supply and capacity out West in order to source that capacity. Now, in the East, I did say that we had some shippers moving small business to us. What we're encouraged by is every single week we've had new startups in the East, and they're -- these are lots of customers, relatively small business segments. So this can be 100 loads a year. It can be 1000 loads a year. These aren't big, big chunks, but customers are coming to us talking about they're able to shift more back to intermodal whether it be a sustainability effort on their part, maybe it's an effort because they want to get out in front of what they believe will be a tightening in the truckload market. It's also an acknowledgment of the better service performance that we have sustained for well over a year now in the East. And I think that we're very encouraged by acknowledgment from the customers that the service quality has earned intermodal a new right at the table at many of those shippers. And that's beginning to play out. And we certainly thought it was worthwhile to call out because it is. We've sustained this opportunity with many, many customers for -- throughout the third quarter and look to gain momentum on that as we move forward. I don't know, Spencer, if you want to comment on that part of it.\nSpencer Frazier: Well, I think you're 100% right, Darren, in thinking about how service connects to growth, and then also with the comment on what are customers thinking about for 2025, we get a couple of questions consistently from our customers and that they are, number one, when is this market going to change? None of us have a crystal ball. They don't either. The other question is, what do the best transportation and supply chain customers do with their kind of mix and strategies? And I would say whenever things start to change, historically, customers have leaned into highway to intermodal conversion. They've leaned into adding dedicated capacity or exploring the dedicated options for their private fleet. They've also leaned into really doing more with the best service providers in their live-and-drop networks that create efficiency and value for them. And so those are the conversations that we're starting to have, some of the things that we're starting to see, and it's really why we focus in on operational excellence across our entire business, so we can be in a position to serve our customers well as things change.\nShelley Simpson: I'm going to add one other thing. I think it is important through the pandemic, both on the up and the down, through this freight recession, our customers were challenged with telling us what shipments we would actually haul. So their ability to forecast has been super difficult over the last four years. We're on our second quarter where bid compliance is in a reasonable level in the mid-80s. Now, in intermodal and JBT, those are two networks that really need more stability to build out and create more efficiency in a network. So as we come into this bid season, our network is out of balance because of our customers now coming back to balance. So we're coming into this bid season knowing and being able to predict better, both our customers and us, what those network balance needs are inside intermodal, inside JBTs. You're going to see us start to fill in those gaps, so the empties and all the things we're having to do to service our customers that are currently short-term cost, we will be able to solve for those over this next bid season, not necessarily solving in one bid season, but you'll see that start to be solved for over the next couple of bid seasons. That's a positive sign for our business moving into '25.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Zazula with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Zazula: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. For Brad or Shelley. you guys have talked about doing some things to repair intermodal margins. I'm wondering if you could talk -- I mean, you have talked about your relationship with BNSF. I wonder if you could talk about the strategic nature of that relationship. Maybe if it's a little bit more dynamic and some things you can do with that relationship to try to encourage better returns for you that can hopefully get you back towards those margin targets.\nDarren Field: Okay, David, this is Darren and I'll try to comment on that. I think from a strategic standpoint with BNSF, the areas that we're focused on together to drive efficiency for each other come from growing. Growth in our intermodal business today is a contributor to improving our margins certainly now. Is there something we're going to do that creates some new model or new method of execution? No, I don't think we're going to change the way we function in terms of we've got a drayman that goes in or a truck that goes up and picks a load up. We've got a lot of assets that we own in order to accommodate this growth, and we'll be very focused on growing together. And then how can we get utilization out of the assets for both BNSF and J.B. Hunt? So from a margin repair standpoint, the focus that we have today is to grow our business, look for efficiency in our network, how can we fill up more empties, which would certainly drive some benefits to our margin? And then again, there needs to be some core pricing work done in order to get to our goals certainly. So that's how we'll focus. I don't think that any one project with BNSF is going to unlock margin with J.B. Hunt, necessarily.\nBrad Delco: Hi, Sarah, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: There's understandably been a lot of focus on the opportunity to restore margin and returns via pricing over the next couple of years. But if we look at three, five years beyond, where do you guys see the biggest opportunities to grow operating income more secularly in the business and at attractive, risk-adjusted returns? And from where you sit today, does that look any different than what we'd say you did over the last five years to 10 years? Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: Yes. Thank you, Bascome. I'll take that. And I would say if you look at all five of our business units, the market size and market opportunity, we think is well-positioned for each one of those five. I don't see our profile changing significantly if you exclude the last two years. Our merger profile, the last two years have been outside of our ranges for the majority of our segments. So if you look over the last five to 10 years, I would see those margin profiles and what we've given guidance on for margin targets really being in line. Our two largest segments, both intermodal and dedicated, although they are very large, the market size opportunity is even larger. So our ability to take both of those segments into high growth categories will just continue our operating income performance inside those. And as highway, both JBT and ICS and final mile continue to move forward. It's going to be difficult for them to catch the size of both intermodal and dedicated. So I think you'll see them continue profit improvement and also revenue growth overall. But I don't see our mix changing significantly.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to CEO, Shelley Simpson, for closing remarks.\nShelley Simpson: Great. Thank you. And I'd like to thank everybody for spending time with us here on the call. And you've heard a lot of discussion from us. You spent a lot of time on intermodal. We've been working really hard on controlling our costs and things that we can control. You've heard us talk about providing excellent service to our customers. Very important for us right now that we make sure our customers know we want to be number one in their minds when they think of a go to of who they want to use. We want them to think of J.B. Hunt across our suite of services. We are focused on controlling our costs where we can, but we are preparing for future transportation needs. So you think about the investments that we've made in our people, technology, capacity, being ready for our customers, and then we will continue maintaining our focus on safety. So we've been working hard. I am proud of several things that have happened this quarter, like our safety performance continuing to improve. Our growth in intermodal volume really proving out that we can take share off the highway into intermodal over the long term. Our six quarters of dedicated selling 250 trucks or more. Our Final Mile business continuing to repair margin. ICS had good improvement, but not there yet, but improvement on cost and quality revenue and furthering diversifying their customer base. JBT's five-year high on service in total. And so I'm very proud of all of the work of our 33,000 people. I'm confident and I remain confident about our opportunities. But although we've done a lot of great work, there's still so much that we have to do. We are still battling our way through this part of the freight cycle and I think that's really important. So we're going to maintain our focus on excellence for our customers, driving value, and we're going to battle through the last part of this freight recession. There's still too much capacity in the market. We need that market to really move into more of equilibrium. We're looking forward to seeing how that plays out into 2025, but our focus will remain on those four pieces I've spoken about. Thank you again for your time. We look forward to talking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive with pressure on both volume and rate. That said, I am encouraged by some of the progress we have made to stabilize trends in the business. Segment gross revenue declined 7% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by a 10% decline in volume, partially offset by a 3% increase in revenue per load. Sequentially, ICS volume increased 2% as our efforts to diversify and strengthen our customer base are starting to yield results. While we continue to focus on quality revenue and growing with the right customers, we have also made strides to right-size the cost structure of our business, especially in our legacy ICS business. Segment gross margins were high at 17.9% for the quarter, highlighting our disciplined bid strategy, effective sourcing and was also aided by some project-related work. We continue to make progress on our costs and better aligning our resources with our current business levels. In the quarter, we did incur some additional expense related to the integration of the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics, which had an approximately $2 million negative impact on our operating expenses in the quarter as compared to the second quarter. Going forward, we will remain focused on further diversifying our customer base, continuing to right-size our cost structure and leveraging our technology to scale growth. We will need to scale the business with more volume on the platform to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability. Moving over to JBT or Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 12% year-over-year, driven by a 6% decrease in volume and a 6% decrease in revenue per load. Our focus remains on attracting the right freight that best fits our network while ensuring that our capacity is positioned in the right markets to meet customer needs. We've seen customer bid compliance improve throughout the year, which allows us to better plan our capacity, which provides efficiency across our network and has contributed to the improved profitability in our JBT business. Our service levels have been very strong and at the highest level since the shift to our power-only model, J.B. Hunt's 360box in 2019. Our high service levels, combined with the flexibility of the drop trailer network, position us well for future growth with new and existing customers. Going forward, we continue to expect to see some pressure on volumes. That said, I am confident in the network discipline that we have and the growth opportunities in front of us as we head into the 2025 bid season. I'll close with some comments on 360. Technology is foundational to our company and is the piece that connects and empowers our people to the available capacity we have to serve our customers. A lot of the significant investments into the foundations of our platform have been complete. That said, we continue to leverage this foundation into new market opportunities. For example, rolling out the platform to the agents we acquired from the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics and also to the SMB and LTL markets, while also improving cargo security in our business. We continue to believe our technology investments will drive greater productivity and efficiency gains across this goal and better position us for long-term growth with our customers. This concludes my comments, so I'll turn the call back to the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Yes, Brian. We had some of that start in the second quarter and we'll certainly have project business that will carry into Q4. Some of that is seasonal work that we do on behalf of our customers. Otherwise, there's small pockets where our customers have needs, where we want to make sure that we're the right partner and service them at a level that we can continue to be that first call when they have those extra needs. I really think that the key element there is just how proud we are of the improvement that we've seen in ICS in particular. The gross margins in the quarter were very healthy and I think that that's representative of the foundational work that we've been focused on all year around quality of revenue and the right type of business, and certainly, our teams have done a great job executing throughout the quarter."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to recent quarters, my comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter, an update on our cost control efforts, and an update on our capital allocation plan for the remainder of 2024. As a general overview, while we have seen some slight moderation in inflationary cost pressures, the deflationary rate environment continues to pressure our overall margin performance across the segments. Let me start with a quick review of the third quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to the prior year period, revenue declined 3%, operating income declined 7% and diluted earnings per share decreased 17%. We saw our volumes on a sequential basis outperform normal seasonality, particularly in JBI, but also in our Highway Services business, which includes both ICS and JBT. That said, overall yield pressure in these areas continue to put pressure on margins and our overall profitability. We continue to focus on productivity, efficiency, and discretionary cost areas to enhance our performance across all of our businesses. We believe this is evidenced and supported by what we believe to be industry-leading margin and return performances in our two largest segments, both Intermodal and Dedicated. Going forward, for the full year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5%, which should imply a decent step-down in our fourth quarter tax rate compared to the prior three quarters. To update on our cost control efforts, we have made significant improvements across the business to right-size our cost structure, mostly evidenced in our Highway Services businesses as both JBT and ICS improved their operating margins compared to the prior year period. We remain thoughtful in our approach to managing our costs, focusing on controlling what we can in the near term without jeopardizing our ability to support future growth and our aggregate earnings power potential. Our focus on cost has been broad-based and covers the entire span of our company. Wrapping up with an update to our 2024 capital plan, we now expect our net capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $625 million, which is below our previously revised expectation of $650 million to $700 million. Our update from the prior quarter largely reflects the sale of all the chassis that we acquired from Walmart, which will not fit the containers we purchased following our retrofitting of those assets. The sale reduces the net purchase price of those assets and gives us even greater confidence in the strategic value of that transaction for our customers and importantly, our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of stock. With limited near-term capital needs with regards to equipment, our current leverage position, market dynamics and our view on where we are in the cycle, we continue to believe a disciplined approach to share repurchases is a prudent use of capital at this time. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Spencer. And Scott, this is John Kuhlow, and actually I thought maybe Shelley was going to take the insurance question. Yes. So, to your point, we did -- over the last couple of years, we had some more significant charges in various quarters for our insurance. That was a little bit more of circumstances around the dramatic increases in where some of these settlements were going and as it was layered against our insurance structure at the time and so, I do feel like we've made a lot of good progress in going through our claims, working with our actuaries and our attorneys, and feel like we're in a good spot with respect to our insurance accruals."

            "name": "Nick Hobbs",
            "content": "Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. Our Dedicated business model is focused on providing professional outsourced private fleet solutions to our customers performed well during the quarter. We believe the resiliency and performance in this segment stands out in the market and supports our differentiated model and go-to-market strategy. While we have discussed some pressure on the fleet size due to customer downsizing, bankruptcies, and as a result of remaining disciplined on our underwriting return hurdles, we believe the market remains stable with ample opportunities for future growth. During the third quarter, we sold 258 trucks of new deals with some we expected to sign in Q3, spilling over into Q4 due to timing. Our sales pipeline remains strong and our team has worked hard to backfill most of those truck losses we have experienced this year. We have started up a significant number of customer locations and trucks over the past two quarters, which has had an impact on our margins as mature business has been replaced by newer, less mature business. That said, we remain disciplined on new customer wins and are confident that this new business will generate both appropriate margins and more importantly, returns on capital once they ramp to maturity. Going forward, we expect new account gross sales to remain stable within our long-term stated range of 1,000 to 1,200 trucks on an annualized basis, but keeping in mind, growth in operating income typically lags fleet growth by a few quarters. Shifting to Final Mile. We have made significant progress to improve the overall health of our business focusing on high-quality service and revenue quality while remaining cost-disciplined through the process. We have seen the market for big and bulky delivery evolve with customers looking for high-quality service providers with national scale and strong safety standards. Overall, demand for big and bulky products remained somewhat challenged with continued soft demand for furniture and modestly soft trends in exercise equipment and appliances. While we remain encouraged by our sales pipeline and continue to engage in discussions with new brands, we have seen some customer churn, which impacted top-line and bottom-line performance in the quarter. Our focus remains on providing the highest service level as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customer with a priority on being safe and secure. We will remain disciplined with potential new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service, while we work to grow the business and improve profitability. Going forward, while we are encouraged by the improvement in our Final Mile business this year, we remain focused on growing the business profitably with the right customers that recognize the value we provide. Similar to last quarter, I'll close with some comments on safety. Our Company is rooted in a foundation of safety for not only our people, but also the motoring public, and we continue to invest in training and equipment to enhance our already strong safety culture. In 2023, we had a record performance in terms of DOT-preventable accidents per million miles. And so far year-to-date, I am pleased to say we have improved further. I am also pleased to announce that we hit our previously stated goal of being 100% roll-out with inward-facing cameras in our trucks by the end of the third quarter. These cameras are just one of many innovative safety initiatives we have rolled out that continues to contribute to our safety culture and performance. As you are aware, the cost of claims have elevated, but we continue to manage and mitigate risk by remaining focused on our safety performance. This concludes my remarks, so I would like to turn the call over to Darren."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. First, our thoughts are with those impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast and Florida. Many of our employees were impacted, and I'm proud of how our company has responded to support them and the recovery and relief efforts in these communities. The rebuilding will take time and J.B. Hunt will continue to support these efforts. Turning to the quarter. We continue to navigate a challenging freight environment while remaining focused on what we can control around our costs, providing exceptional service to our customers, preparing for their future transportation needs and maintaining our focus on safety. As discussed last quarter, we have seen a return to more normal seasonal demand patterns as evidenced across our businesses in the third quarter, which the team will highlight in their remarks. I remain confident in our strategy as we execute on our priorities, which as a reminder are; one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, scale our long-term investments in our company foundations, which are people, technology, and capacity; and three, drive long-term value and returns for our shareholders. Our focus remains on how we can deliver value for our customers with excellent service while looking for ways to drive waste out of their supply chain. We do have some more positive signs in the business to support our work in this area, particularly around our volume trends, customer awards, and third-party surveys that highlight J.B. Hunt's performance. I see more evidence today that we can scale our investments in our people, technology, and capacity to capture additional market share at better returns as the freight cycle inflection occurs. I remain confident in our strategy and maintain our focus on generating appropriate returns on capital to deliver value for our shareholders. As we prepare for an eventual churn in the freight market, we have focused our organization on being operationally excellent and delivering unmatched value for our customers. By controlling what we can right now, we position ourselves to grow with our customers, knowing that these key service components are ingrained in our people. At the same time, we know we need to repair our margins to generate acceptable returns to reinvest in the business and our customers are and should be aware of that as well. We take great pride in providing high-quality service in all that we do, which is a testament to the dedication that our people have to serve customers well. Creating value for our customers is core to what we do and helps build long-term strategic relationships. Customer Value Delivery or CVD is a process that we have used for a while in our dedicated business and we continue to roll this out across our entire organization. Part of the value we create is through our safety culture and performance, which is the strength of our business and we have continued to improve upon last year's record performance as Nick will discuss. The team will provide more details on each of our businesses, but in summary, I continue to have strong conviction around our strategy and the growth potential of our company. We have and we will continue to prove our ability to deliver outperformance for our people, our customers and our shareholders. Our confidence comes from our people, our experience, our complementary suite of services, our scale, our strategic investments and our financial strength. All of these uniquely position us for the future as we pursue our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? No, I think Darren said it well. I would just say, for us, we're very focused on expanding the intermodal market together. So both J.B. Hunt and BN are thinking about how do we launch for customers around intermodal and expanding emerging markets, like things we've done with Quantum and what we're doing with Mexico. We're continuing those conversations. I would say anything that happens from a merchandising perspective would roll over into J.B. Hunt and should benefit us as well. Hi, Scott, it's Shelley. I might just add, we don't model and aren't modeling for a 17%-plus margin that's historically very high for the market. So, I would say anything in the average of 14% to 15% would be more norm. And so there have been some things that ICS has done and some key customers that they're working closely with and I think that's yielded some improvement here in third quarter and we'll see what happens here moving forward. I'm going to add one other thing. I think it is important through the pandemic, both on the up and the down, through this freight recession, our customers were challenged with telling us what shipments we would actually haul. So their ability to forecast has been super difficult over the last four years. We're on our second quarter where bid compliance is in a reasonable level in the mid-80s. Now, in intermodal and JBT, those are two networks that really need more stability to build out and create more efficiency in a network. So as we come into this bid season, our network is out of balance because of our customers now coming back to balance. So we're coming into this bid season knowing and being able to predict better, both our customers and us, what those network balance needs are inside intermodal, inside JBTs. You're going to see us start to fill in those gaps, so the empties and all the things we're having to do to service our customers that are currently short-term cost, we will be able to solve for those over this next bid season, not necessarily solving in one bid season, but you'll see that start to be solved for over the next couple of bid seasons. That's a positive sign for our business moving into '25. Yes. Thank you, Bascome. I'll take that. And I would say if you look at all five of our business units, the market size and market opportunity, we think is well-positioned for each one of those five. I don't see our profile changing significantly if you exclude the last two years. Our merger profile, the last two years have been outside of our ranges for the majority of our segments. So if you look over the last five to 10 years, I would see those margin profiles and what we've given guidance on for margin targets really being in line. Our two largest segments, both intermodal and dedicated, although they are very large, the market size opportunity is even larger. So our ability to take both of those segments into high growth categories will just continue our operating income performance inside those. And as highway, both JBT and ICS and final mile continue to move forward. It's going to be difficult for them to catch the size of both intermodal and dedicated. So I think you'll see them continue profit improvement and also revenue growth overall. But I don't see our mix changing significantly. Great. Thank you. And I'd like to thank everybody for spending time with us here on the call. And you've heard a lot of discussion from us. You spent a lot of time on intermodal. We've been working really hard on controlling our costs and things that we can control. You've heard us talk about providing excellent service to our customers. Very important for us right now that we make sure our customers know we want to be number one in their minds when they think of a go to of who they want to use. We want them to think of J.B. Hunt across our suite of services. We are focused on controlling our costs where we can, but we are preparing for future transportation needs. So you think about the investments that we've made in our people, technology, capacity, being ready for our customers, and then we will continue maintaining our focus on safety. So we've been working hard. I am proud of several things that have happened this quarter, like our safety performance continuing to improve. Our growth in intermodal volume really proving out that we can take share off the highway into intermodal over the long term. Our six quarters of dedicated selling 250 trucks or more. Our Final Mile business continuing to repair margin. ICS had good improvement, but not there yet, but improvement on cost and quality revenue and furthering diversifying their customer base. JBT's five-year high on service in total. And so I'm very proud of all of the work of our 33,000 people. I'm confident and I remain confident about our opportunities. But although we've done a lot of great work, there's still so much that we have to do. We are still battling our way through this part of the freight cycle and I think that's really important. So we're going to maintain our focus on excellence for our customers, driving value, and we're going to battle through the last part of this freight recession. There's still too much capacity in the market. We need that market to really move into more of equilibrium. We're looking forward to seeing how that plays out into 2025, but our focus will remain on those four pieces I've spoken about. Thank you again for your time. We look forward to talking with you next quarter."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. Let me start with a review of Intermodal's performance during the quarter. Overall, we saw the momentum from the second quarter accelerate into the third quarter as our overall volume was up 5% year-over-year, which modestly outperformed normal seasonality. The volume growth during the third quarter was driven by 7% growth in Transcon with Southern California outbound volumes up double-digits once again this quarter and 3% growth in the East. By month, our consolidated volumes were up 7% in July, up 4% in August, and up 4% in September. In the East, we continue to compete more directly with one-way truckload, but as evidenced by our overall volume improvement this quarter, we are beginning to win back small amounts of freight from customers due to our strong service levels and ability to meet their capacity needs. As we look to our bid warehouse, we continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal as it is more economical and environmentally friendly. We stand ready and have the capacity and people in place to meet and exceed our customer service needs both now and in the years ahead. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure year-over-year and despite a modest improvement in margins sequentially, we did incur additional expenses in the third quarter. You've heard me say that right now, volume means more to us than it has ever before and that remains true. However, pricing has been and is still the biggest lever to improve margins. While we did see sequential volume growth, we absorbed additional expense during the quarter to keep our network fluid in light of the imbalances caused by the strength in our networks, specifically out of Southern California. We are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing in customers' bid compliance, which will provide us better opportunities in the future to fill in lane imbalances and drive greater efficiencies in the network. Going forward, and as a reminder, we implemented the remaining pricing from our 2024 bid season during the third quarter. And given the nature of our pricing cycle, we will be living with a large portion of current pricing through the first half of 2025. We just kicked off our 2025 bid season and we do like our position given our service levels and ability to handle customer surge demand that we have been experiencing. We continue to see truckload pricing that we believe is unsustainable over the long term, particularly in the Eastern network. We have recently seen some shippers look to convert small amounts of freight from truck to rail in the East, which we are encouraged by and highlights our service and value proposition that we and our rail providers are able to provide. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service levels from each of them, their commitment to the Intermodal offering in growing the overall market. That said, we and our railroad providers know the true test of our collective service will come once freight volumes increase with higher overall demand on our networks. We have been in constant dialogue with them that this peak could serve as one of many proven moments to show customers that we collectively can handle significant growth while maintaining proper service. Maintaining service during periods of stronger demand like we are experiencing today supports the case for Intermodal growth and additional conversion from over-the-road freight. Our conviction in the strength of our Intermodal franchise hasn't wavered. Our customers trust us, our service levels are exceptional, and our optimism on the future growth of our Intermodal business hasn't changed. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Sure. So, Ken, appreciate the question. I'm sure Spencer might have some thoughts as well. Look, as we went into peak season planning, we communicated with all of our customers and looked for as much of their advice as we could get and prepared our plans. We certainly know that there were customers that were shifting business back to the West Coast from the East because it fit their network well. We had customers shifting freight from the East back to the West because of fears of a potential labor strike on the East Coast. We had customers talking about a pull forward just from a preparedness and an overall capacity standpoint. And we had many, many customers that said normal peak. So I think that the results are really in terms of a mixed bag, in terms of how much was pulled forward, we don't really know. I don't want to tell you that none of it was. Some of it was certainly pulled forward. We do have a lot of customers that continue to expect a normal peak as we go through the fourth quarter. So we do anticipate continued demand for our services and we'll all kind of have to wait and see if it's a faster pull down. But at this point, I think we're expecting things to behave what we consider normal. Spencer, I don't know if you have some thoughts you'd like to share there. Okay, Brian, your phone kind of broke up there, but I think I know the gist of it. Just for -- our Western provider, we continue to be engaged at all levels of our organization in terms of how can we be more efficient and stronger together when we solve problems together. I'm aware that Ed Harris being assigned as a consultant to BNSF has created a handful of questions. It's our understanding that he's really focused on their merchandise network. I would say this, BNSF is the largest intermodal provider and moves the densest intermodal business, serving the fewest nodes in the intermodal industry. That density is very much in line with all things PSR. Now, I'm not saying they're a PSR railroad. It's just -- they didn't have to do that. There's a lot of attention to intermodal at BNSF in terms of their growth channel. And we're convinced that there is no changes coming to our business in the coming months or years. There's no deviation from their strategy to grow intermodal. We're very encouraged by their commentary. If anything, improvement in their merchandise network could positively influence intermodal service. We'll wait and see. That's not an area of their business that we stay focused on. But we're assured by the BNSF that PSR is not a strategy at BNSF. I don't know if Shelley wanted to make a comment on that or not. Okay. Well, on the revenue per load, I mean the mix -- the mix results in the quarter were -- our length of haul was actually longer in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter and there was sequential pricing pressure certainly that played a role in those results. I lost a little piece of your question there. I just know that, as we've gone through the year and implemented new pricing, none of us are satisfied with where we're at in terms of the returns on our business. We still believe that the pathway to help for us is to execute on behalf of our customers, make sure that we're doing what we say we're going to do, and deliver value to our customers so that when the world changes, we're prepared and in a good position to talk about the quality of our service, the challenges we have from a cost standpoint and recover some of our margin through pricing efforts. That's -- that will continue to be our focus and we'll wait and see how that plays out as we move into next year. Okay. Well, on the sequential margin, at the end of the day, volume, we've said before, volume has meant more to us today than ever before. It still isn't more valuable than the role that pricing would play. When pricing can turn, you can see that impact margin quicker. Certainly, velocity on our system can play a role. When we pick up volume, there's efficiencies we gain inside of our drayage operation or there's certainly a lot of opportunity to grow. A load out of Southern California is not the same as a load going back to Southern California. So, the mix of the traffic that operates in the third quarter versus second quarter is very different and the result of the margin is what it is. As we go into the next year, and like I said earlier in the call, I mean we're not satisfied with our returns. We believe that carriers are operating at rates below their cost. We think they're unsustainable. We're surprised by the longevity and how long it has lasted. We also have been wrong in the past when we believed that the pricing market was about to turn and we could get rates up and I would even say at this point last year, probably I'm not sure I said it, but I probably did believe that a year ago today and I would have been wrong. And so, as we go into the bid season, we're focused on delivering value to our customers, talking about the capacity answers that we have, also talking about the cost challenges we face, talking about how we're prepared to serve their needs in a host of ways and that's at the enterprise-level. And so, as we go into this bid cycle, we're going to continue that process because the experience in this room has taught us that that's the best approach. Okay. All good questions, Chris. So, certainly, let me let me touch on the empties first. So, I don't know how to call it durable, whether it's going to stick or not. The balance of Southern California is inbound and outbound. There certainly is an uptick in demand for the Eastbound volume coming off the West Coast, whereas there's not necessarily an uptick in demand for Westbound flows. If the need to support capacity in Southern California sustains at the kind of new ratio today that we're experiencing now, then certainly that has to find its way into the economics with the customers. And I don't think that will completely surprise our customers, but it certainly is a factor as we move forward. I think that in 2024, it's a little more visible because the growth opportunity that we saw off the West Coast was stronger than it was in the East. So, it's sort of getting a little bit extra spotlight on the demand for supply and capacity out West in order to source that capacity. Now, in the East, I did say that we had some shippers moving small business to us. What we're encouraged by is every single week we've had new startups in the East, and they're -- these are lots of customers, relatively small business segments. So this can be 100 loads a year. It can be 1000 loads a year. These aren't big, big chunks, but customers are coming to us talking about they're able to shift more back to intermodal whether it be a sustainability effort on their part, maybe it's an effort because they want to get out in front of what they believe will be a tightening in the truckload market. It's also an acknowledgment of the better service performance that we have sustained for well over a year now in the East. And I think that we're very encouraged by acknowledgment from the customers that the service quality has earned intermodal a new right at the table at many of those shippers. And that's beginning to play out. And we certainly thought it was worthwhile to call out because it is. We've sustained this opportunity with many, many customers for -- throughout the third quarter and look to gain momentum on that as we move forward. I don't know, Spencer, if you want to comment on that part of it. Okay, David, this is Darren and I'll try to comment on that. I think from a strategic standpoint with BNSF, the areas that we're focused on together to drive efficiency for each other come from growing. Growth in our intermodal business today is a contributor to improving our margins certainly now. Is there something we're going to do that creates some new model or new method of execution? No, I don't think we're going to change the way we function in terms of we've got a drayman that goes in or a truck that goes up and picks a load up. We've got a lot of assets that we own in order to accommodate this growth, and we'll be very focused on growing together. And then how can we get utilization out of the assets for both BNSF and J.B. Hunt? So from a margin repair standpoint, the focus that we have today is to grow our business, look for efficiency in our network, how can we fill up more empties, which would certainly drive some benefits to our margin? And then again, there needs to be some core pricing work done in order to get to our goals certainly. So that's how we'll focus. I don't think that any one project with BNSF is going to unlock margin with J.B. Hunt, necessarily."

            "name": "Spencer Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on the market, our commercial strategy and some feedback we are hearing from our customers. In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of more normal seasonal demand patterns, particularly across our Intermodal and Highway segments. In JBT and ICS, we experienced modestly improving volume trends and some pockets of tightness across the country, which would or should be expected around the month-end and quarter-end. While in general, capacity remains readily available in the market on the highway side of the business, some customers are beginning to use more mini bids to fill some out-of-cycle capacity needs. Additionally, there is interest in having more collaborative long-term planning discussions around business strategies. Historically, both of these engagements have been indicative that supply and demand are becoming more imbalanced. When we have conversations with customers around their transportation needs, we highlight the value our [Indiscernible] services can present and focus on excellence to ensure all of our customer needs are being met. Our goal is to achieve the top ranking on each of our customers' service provider scorecards. With some customers, we've achieved our goal, while with others, we have some opportunities to improve. Through our mode-neutral sales strategy, we work with our customers to develop the optimal solution for their needs with our people leveraging our full suite of services and technology to create value. We believe this is a clear differentiator for J.B. Hunt in the market. Our focus is on providing the best customer experience with every interaction we have while living up to our say-do culture. We know that excellent service the first time leads to opportunities for future growth across our customer supply chain and we are committed to achieving both. I'll close with some feedback we are hearing from customers. First, we are beginning to execute the peak season plans we developed with our customers. While some volumes were pulled forward into Q3, we also incurred more peak season start-up costs to pre-position resources to serve our customers' peak demand in Q4. Secondly, each customer, regardless of size and industry is unique. Within our diverse portfolio, our customers are somewhat mixed on the outlooks for demand for their products and what their transportation needs will look like in the near-to-medium term. While that is their view on the market, we believe we are in a strong position to take share based on the value we can create for our customers with our people, technology, and most importantly, our consistent service levels. Lastly, as we sit here today, capacity is not a top concern for customers, but they are aware that the current market dynamics will shift, though the timing and rate of change remains uncertain. Customers are also aware that there has been significant cost inflation across our industry and margins are under pressure. With these knowns, we will continue to work with them to help drive efficiencies across their supply chain while balancing our need to repair our margins. We remain committed to investing in our business and growing with our customers over the long term by delivering consistent value at the high service levels they've come to expect from J.B. Hunt. That concludes my remarks. So, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick. Yes, Darren, thanks for that. And Ken, appreciate your question. A couple of things. Just regarding the port strike in the East, as Darren mentioned, our customers really deployed a handful of different strategies. Some of that was a little bit of a shift to the West. Some of it maybe pulled some inventory in ahead of that strike, and others had a wait-and-see approach. And when we sit here right now, I'd say we've got a couple weeks for those East Coast ports to really normalize their flows. But something to consider is this deadline just got extended to January 15th. And so the plays that they ran leading up to this event are now probably going to be rerun as we look forward into January. And then also, I'd say a couple of other things just around peak and peak demand. I want to give our customers a lot of credit for the work that they've done as their demand has normalized, as well as their inventories have normalized with their forecast, the capacity needs from J.B. Hunt. They've done a better job of that, I think. Brad and Darren both mentioned that our bid compliance numbers have improved. We're happy to see that. And then also as we think about peak going forward, we're still in active conversations to make sure we continue to position our people to successfully execute peak along with our capacity over the next several weeks, so our customers can have a great finish to the year. All right. Thanks, Jordan. Yes, I'll talk about that a little bit. I have been reading a lot about competition in the Dedicated market as well. But what we're seeing in the marketplace and where we're focused on really private fleet replacement, we're not seeing any unusual competition out there, I would say, and what we're really targeting, we love our pipeline. We love the success we've had. We're remaining disciplined in our pricing margins and so, we feel very good about that. We're -- I see a lot of the competition and hear about a lot of it is more in the retail, dry van kind of drop and hook, more commoditized. And we have a little bit in there, but not a lot. But just looking at the names that we've been awarded in the last week, you probably wouldn't recognize three or four of the names in there, the private fleets that we've taken over. So, we feel good about that. Now from private fleets, I would say, yes, some of the large private fleets are growing and that's fine. But if I look at the market, $60 billion to $80 billion to $90 billion that we have qualified, we still feel very good about where we're going and our sales targets. So, I read a lot about the competition and we see some, we've lost some business with our trucks. But overall, I feel very good that with our disciplined pricing approach, we can still be very, very successful. Yes. And Darren, I'll add, Daniel, you kind of wanted to know a little bit about where we're at with customers in our conversations. And I would say this, they're in their bid and budgeting process right now. And in that, they're challenged to operate their supply chain and find ways to do that in the most efficient way possible. And they also know, as Darren just said, the costs in our industries have been rising dramatically and the margins are not sufficient. But when we have those conversations with our customers, really we are very transparent in the cost-to-serve them while working with them to design optimal solutions across their network. And ultimately, we're leaning on the consistently high service levels that drive value and find a match for that value for both companies. And ultimately, that's going to set them up, set our teams up for success, and hopefully improve our returns in the process. Well, I think you're 100% right, Darren, in thinking about how service connects to growth, and then also with the comment on what are customers thinking about for 2025, we get a couple of questions consistently from our customers and that they are, number one, when is this market going to change? None of us have a crystal ball. They don't either. The other question is, what do the best transportation and supply chain customers do with their kind of mix and strategies? And I would say whenever things start to change, historically, customers have leaned into highway to intermodal conversion. They've leaned into adding dedicated capacity or exploring the dedicated options for their private fleet. They've also leaned into really doing more with the best service providers in their live-and-drop networks that create efficiency and value for them. And so those are the conversations that we're starting to have, some of the things that we're starting to see, and it's really why we focus in on operational excellence across our entire business, so we can be in a position to serve our customers well as things change."

I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ms. Shelley Simpson, for some opening comments. Shelley?\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by saying I'm humbled and honored to have recently assumed the role of CEO and to lead our great company on the next phase of our growth journey. While recognizing this is a big moment as only the fifth organizational leader in our company's 62-year history, let me be clear our vision, our mission, and our focus has not changed. We have large addressable markets. We provide excellent service for customers. We have talented people across our organization. We are primed and we are ready to execute on our opportunities for growth. My message to the team on day one was quite simple, ready, set, go. As you've heard us say consistently, we remain committed to our investments and managing the business with a long-term mindset. These investments span across our company foundations, which include our people, our technology, and our capacity. Through investments in these key areas, we have a significant number of opportunities to provide value to and on behalf of our customers across our suite of complementary service offerings. Our focus remains on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see a long-term opportunity to generate compounding returns. We operate in an industry that is cyclical, but we have focused on businesses and areas that we feel confident we can compete effectively, take share, and win. We do this by remaining financially disciplined, keeping our focus on the long-term while managing costs in the near term, and relying on our vast experience. We will be prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while driving long-term growth for the company and our shareholders. Earlier this year, we introduced our priorities for 2024, and we as a management team and as an organization continue to execute on these priorities, which as a reminder are, one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence. Two, scale our long-term investment in our company foundations, which are people, technology, and capacity. And three, drive long-term value and returns for our shareholders. While the first half of this year has been challenging in terms of our financial performance, we remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. In 2024, we've continued our record performance in safety and our service levels to customers has been exceptional. We have received multiple awards this year for our high service level from our customers. Our joint Intermodal service offering with BNSF, Quantum, is running well above our initial expectation from an on-time service performance. In Dedicated, we continue to prove our value to customers as we've been able to balance the need to be disciplined with underwriting new business while providing customers some flexibility with meeting their needs. Final Mile continues to make progress on its profit improvement plan and we continue to work on areas around cost, integration, and growth in ICS, and see some progress in the business. Finally, we remain encouraged about the value proposition for customers in our drop trailing business in JBT and the future potential of that business. While admittedly the market has been challenging, we have invested throughout this downturn to set us up for future growth and success across the business. We continue to focus on controlling expenses in the near term without jeopardizing our long-term potential, managing our headcount through attrition, while at the same time continuing to deploy and enhance our technology to increase the productivity of our people. We took advantage of a strategic opportunity to acquire the Intermodal assets from Walmart earlier this year, which added capacity to our network, but also increased the long-term growth potential of our company, which we believe will drive long-term returns for both the company and our shareholders. The team will provide more details with their prepared comments, but in summary, we will stay the course, focus on the long term, with the same vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to recent quarters, my comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and provide an update on our cost control efforts while also balancing our investments to support future growth. I'll close with an update on our capital allocation plan for the remainder of 2024. As a general overview, while we have seen some moderation in inflationary cost pressures, the deflationary rate environment continues to pressure our margin performance. Let me start with a quick review of the second quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to the prior year period, revenue declined 7%, operating income declined 24%, and diluted earnings per share decreased 27%. A combination of either lower volumes and/or yields, but most notably lower rates, were the main drivers of the lower revenue primarily in our Intermodal and Highway Services businesses, which includes our brokerage business in ICS and our drop trailer business in JBT. Our tax rate in the quarter was slightly elevated at 26.8%. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to fall in the range of 24% to 25%. While we have seen improvements across many of our cost categories, the lower revenue continue to put pressure on our margins across our business segments, with the exception of FMS and JBT, which improved operating margins year-over-year. We have been thoughtful and thorough in our approach to managing our costs. Last quarter, we quantified what our commitments to investing in our business through this downturn represented, which was in aggregate $100 million on an annual basis. We continue to focus our cost efforts in areas that would not prohibit our ability to support our future growth or our future earnings power. These costs are primarily related to our investments in two of our company foundations, namely our people and our capacity. As to be expected, the majority of these costs are burdened in our JBI business, and also, but to a lesser extent, our ICS and JBT segments. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to grow our business to scale into these investments. Wrapping up with an update to our 2024 capital plan, we are updating our guidance for net capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. This compares to our previous expectation of $800 million to $1 billion. Keep in mind, this does include the previously announced purchase of Walmart's Intermodal assets. This reduced plan largely reflects a moderation of both tractor and trailing fleet additions in addition to real estate projects. While our earnings performance has been under pressure, our leverage at the end of the quarter was 0.9 times EBITDA, below our target of 1 times. We also purchased just over $200 million of stock in the quarter. With our updated and reduced net capital expenditure plan, current market dynamics, and our view of where we are in the cycle, we believe a disciplined approach to share repurchases is a prudent use of capital at this time. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Spencer.\nSpencer Frazier: Thank you, John, and good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be joining the call. My remarks will focus on our sales and marketing strategy, but will also include some perspectives on the market, as well as feedback we are hearing from our customers. During the second quarter, we saw more normalized seasonal patterns across our business. On the demand side, the second quarter felt more like what we're accustomed to seeing prior to the pandemic disruption. April started a little slower from a demand perspective, primarily due to the timing of Easter, but we did experience what used to be a typical end of month and end of quarter lift in June. This was evidenced particularly in both JBI and JBT in the quarter, where we've seen strong improvements in bid compliance levels in the mid-80s to 90s levels, which we haven't seen in quite some time. We were able to meet this seasonal demand for our customers with high service levels across our businesses. Our customers have worked through most of their excess inventory and feel appropriately right-sized with current sales activity levels. While we cannot predict when the market will inflect, our customers know we stand ready to meet their growing transportation needs across our entire scroll of services. Regarding our scroll, our customers buy capacity across our suite of services and have come to expect a consistent high service level experience. In fact, greater than 90% of our Top 100 customers buy more than one service from us and greater than 75% buy from three or more services. Among our segments, JBI and ICS have the highest overlap amongst our Top 100 customers. We see the power of the scroll in our sales efforts as customers have recently wanted to de-emphasize their use of brokers in favor of assets. And we've converted some nice wins over to JBT as a result. Being mode-indifferent and offering customers the best solution will always guide our go-to-market strategy. As we look at the overall freight market, we still see oversupply across all modes, with shippers having options on both mode and provider to move their freight. Now, while capacity is not a top concern right now, there is an awareness that this will change at some point, but the timing of which though remains unclear. Currently, cost and value are the primary differentiators right now for customers, and we continue to lean into the value we can deliver to customers with our premium service. As we have said in previous quarters, we don't know when the cycle will shift and aren't going to make a prediction. But we remain committed to investing in our business for the long term and being ready to grow with our customers over many years to solve their transportation needs with high service levels they've come to expect from J.B. Hunt. I'll wrap up with some of the feedback we're getting regarding peak season. We see the same datasets that most of you track and read the same headlines around what's happening in the ocean freight market. The feedback we hear is an expectation for a peak season this year, but the magnitude or length of peak remains to be seen. That said, some customers have pulled a portion of their peak freight forward a couple months, given the multiple macro factors that could impact the supply chain later this year. This pull forward has created an early peak on the water, but that hasn't translated into domestic inland moves just yet. We are working with customers on peak season plans to ensure we have resources properly positioned to meet their transportation needs. That concludes my remarks. So, I would now like to turn the call over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on Dedicated, Final Mile Business, and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. While we are not immune to the impact of the overall market, we believe our results during the quarter continue to highlight the strength and resiliency of our unique, Dedicated business model. We believe our differentiation is supported by our focus on providing professional, outsourced private fleet solutions to a broad and diverse group of customers, in addition to our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers. During the second quarter, we sold 325 trucks of new deals. While we have visibility to some losses or downsizing throughout 2024, our sales pipeline remains solid and our team has done well to backfill some of those losses. Despite the challenging market conditions, importantly, we have remained committed to our discipline in the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return thresholds. With a proven track record of high service levels and our ability to create value for our customers, we continue to have success onboarding new business and renewing business with our existing customers. We remain confident in our ability to execute on the transportation needs of our customers and the opportunity to further compound our growth over many years. Going forward, despite our strong new truck sales in the first half of the year, I would expect our fleet count to end the year relatively flat from our Q2 levels, with some additional startup expenses as new trucks are brought into the fleet. Shifting to Final Mile. I continue to be pleased with our progress we have made to improve the overall health of this business. This journey started many years ago as we focused on a differentiated high quality service to then focusing on revenue quality and remaining cost discipline throughout the process. The market for big and bulky delivery continues to evolve and customers are looking for a high quality, safe and secure service provider with national scale. For transparency purposes, our second quarter results did include a net benefit of $1.1 million from two offsetting claims settlements. Demand for big and bulky products remain mixed with stable demand for both appliances and exercise equipment, but continued softness in furniture demand. We remain modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. We continue to strive to provide the highest level as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customer with a focus on being safe and secure. We will remain disciplined with potential new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while we work to grow the business and improve profitability. Going forward, we would expect some customer churn as we continue to focus on revenue quality, but for margin performance to follow fairly normal seasonal patterns, excluding the unique item called out in the quarter. Similar to the last quarters, I'll close with some comments on safety. Our company was built on a foundation of safety for not only our people but also the motoring public and we continue to invest in training and equipment to enhance our already strong safety culture. We continue to lead the industry with our fleet that is now over 97% rolled out with inward-facing cameras and we remain on track to be 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. As you may recall, 2023 was our best safety performance on record for DOT preventable accidents per million miles. And I'm pleased to say, with the help of our inward facing cameras, along with our numerous other innovative safety initiatives, we are seeing further improvements so far here today. This is a testament to the quality of our drivers and the safety culture of our company as the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially, we remain focused on finding new innovative ways to further enhance our safety performance and mitigate risk where possible. This concludes my remarks. So, I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, while we saw seasonality that resembled more normalized pre-pandemic demand trends during the quarter, the impact of a depressed truckload market and competitive bid season in general, more than offset this and drove our volume down 1% year-over-year. This was primarily driven in the east where we compete more directly with one-way truckload where our volumes were down 7% in the quarter. This was partially offset by our Transcon business growing 4% in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand out of Southern California where volumes were up double digits versus the prior year. By month, our consolidated volumes were down 3% in April, up 1% in May, and down 1% in June. During June, we did see a nice seasonal lift in volume, particularly toward the end of the month, and importantly, we were able to meet our customers' capacity needs with strong service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. As we look at the freight market, we continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal as it is more economical and environmentally friendly. As I've said it before and I want to say it again, we stand ready and have the capacity and people in place to meet and exceed our customer service needs and recapture share from the highway moving forward. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially. This is largely related to the market pressure on our yields but also due to our capacity investments. While volume does mean more to us now than ever before given our underutilized capacity, our modestly lower volume year-over-year and only slightly higher volumes sequentially wasn't enough to absorb our higher cost and deflationary yield pressure. As discussed earlier in the year, bid season was competitive and largely wrapped up during the second quarter. We continued to see truckload pricing that we believe is unsustainable, particularly in the east, and shippers took advantage. Given the nature of our pricing cycle, we will be living with a large portion of the recently completed bids into the first half of 2025. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the intermodal offering and growing the overall market. That said, we and our railroad partners know the true test of our collective service will come once freight volumes increase with higher overall demand on our networks. We remain confident in the collaborative work and investments being made to maintain high service levels as the inflection occurs. In closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. Our service levels are exceptional and we are confident that this level of service can continue as our customers\u2019 overall demand for our capacity increases. While we are not pleased with our current results, our optimism on the future growth of our business hasn't changed. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient, cost competitive, and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments while also providing an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive with pressure on both volume and rate. Segment gross revenue declined 21% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by a 25% decline in volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. As you have heard, we did see some seasonality in the business with some relative tightness in the market around road checks and in the later part of June. That said, our gross margins for the quarter were 14.8%, the highest we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2022, which is noteworthy, given 61% of our volumes are under contract. We continue to focus on quality revenue and growing with the right customers as our yield performance indicates. Admittedly, we are incurring some challenges integrating the previously announced acquisition of BNSF Logistics, but remain encouraged and optimistic about the potential of the agent model on our platform. These challenges are masking some of the underlying progress we are seeing in our legacy ICS business. Going forward, we will remain focused on further right-sizing our cost structure, but ultimately, we need to push more volume through our platform in order to see material improvements in our results. Moving over to JBT or Truckload, segment gross revenue was down 12% year-over-year, driven by a 9% decrease in volume and a 4% decrease in revenue per load. This season was competitive and we opted to remain disciplined on price, which resulted in some lost volume. That said, we are focused on attracting the right freight that best fits our network with the right customers that see the value of our service and network of trailing capacity. While we currently have excess trailing capacity in our network, we are working on ensuring discipline around our network to ensure that we have the right capacity in the right markets where our customers have needs and where they are growing. We hear from customers that they appreciate our high service levels and the flexibility that our drop trailer offering provides to their supply chain. Our model allows us to be more variable with our costs depending on the market, which we believe ultimately presents us with opportunities to scale this cost competitive service offering for customers while ensuring we generate an appropriate return on capital. Going forward, our focus is on improving our trailer utilization rate while ensuring our capacity remains balanced across the network. I'll close with some comments on J.B. Hunt 360. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity, and also drives efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Technology is foundational to our company, but it's also created opportunities for strategic theft groups to impact our operations. We continue to deploy enhancements to our system to increase the security of our platform and have become much more stringent on carrier vetting to mitigate cargo theft risk, which continues to be very prevalent in the industry and in particular for our customers who are feeling the impact. Long-term, technology investments will continue to drive productivity and efficiency gains across the scroll and better position us for long-term growth with our customers. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to the operator who will open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Darren, you mentioned a pickup near the end of June on some of the volumes. I'm just wondering, does that have to do with some of the themes that Spencer spoke about regarding maybe moving up peak season a little bit, or is there something else going on, particularly in the Transcon in Southern California, that gives you a little bit more optimism about the cycle?\nDarren Field: Yeah, I appreciate the question. Certainly, Spencer's comments just on overall imports through Southern California is one of many factors resulting in just a general improving trends throughout the first quarter -- or throughout that second quarter. I do want to highlight, we referenced a negative 1% volume comp in June. June of \u201823 had two more working days than June of \u201824, and so that's certainly an influencer in that comparison. But again, as the quarter went on, we experienced some improving trends from our customers. I also highlighted in the prepared comments that we were up double digits out of Southern California for the entirety of the second quarter. So certainly some customers would highlight that maybe that was a result of early shipments for peak season. Some customers highlighted that generally their business had improved. And in some cases, we had converted back Highway business to Intermodal. So, it's kind of a mash of everything to see some improvements that occurred during the quarter.\nSpencer Frazier: Yeah, and hey, John, this is Spencer. I'd just like to add a little bit to that. When I talk about normal seasonal trends, I think that's something that we really need to think about across our customer base. Normal seasonal trends end of month, end of quarter, in Q2 really are related to back to school, things that are prepping for that season, for other events that take place here in July with different promotional things. So, I'm encouraged from our customer base that really normal seasonality started to show up for us. And I think that's something that we're going to be looking forward to as we move on. I think that in the prior years, we struggled really with seeing seasonal trends in a normal way. There was just still so much disruption. So, appreciate the question, just wanted to add those comments.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi, afternoon. So just, I know you've talked about this a bunch before, the Intermodal margin recovery story. I know you have the excess capacity now. But, is it mostly a function of getting sequential revenue per load to move up? And do you feel, given now that the contract season is largely done for the next several quarters, at least looking ahead, do you feel you've reached a point of stability on that revenue per load? Thanks.\nDarren Field: Well, certainly we highlighted that this current, what I'll call the 2024 bid cycle, largely completed during the second quarter. Those prices and the yields that we achieved were not strong enough to give us margin improvement that we believe our system can and should run. We're not changing our long-term margin target. We're not satisfied with the current returns on our business and do recognize that pricing improvement is one of a couple of areas, but the most important area in order to get margin improvement. Certainly, volume is worth more to us today than ever before. We've said that quite often, and that's just a result of having as much underutilized equipment as we currently have. And then all things cost. What can we do to be more efficient as an organization? That can be inside the activities of our drivers and our drayage operation, that can be certainly inside the activities of our people. How do we utilize technology better? How can we just be more efficient with our customers? But over the long term, pricing will always be the most valuable element to improving margins more than volume or just operational efficiency, but we will work on all three every day.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I wanted to touch a little bit on that margin comment. I guess we saw volume up sequentially, and I know yields were going down, but we also saw profit down sequentially. So I guess, from a seasonal perspective, that doesn't necessarily always show up. So, I guess I just want to make sure I understand from a cost perspective, if there was something incremental you were dealing with this quarter, if it's the kind of thing that we see improvement in volume from here, should we be able to see margin or operating profit improvement sequentially from here?\nDarren Field: It's really -- a pricing implementation element is probably the largest driving factor behind the non-normal seasonal sequential change in profitability. Certainly the implementation of the bid cycle has been a headwind to seeing earnings improve. We will say it often, volume will be our leading indicator and pricing will always lag volume. And so as we find our way through the rest of the year and look for opportunities to grow our business, we believe over the long term, certainly pricing improvements will lag that volume.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So I know you don't like to give too much in the way of quarterly guidance, but maybe it would just be helpful to get expectations in a reasonable place at some point. But -- so as we see the full impact of these bids, Darren, do you think we should expect one more quarter of sort of a sequential step down in rev per load and margin? So that's like near term. And then just longer term, bigger picture, right, and prior downturns, we've seen you guys take share and that really sets you up for the next cycle of earnings growth going forward. We're not seeing that this time and I guess I'm wondering if you have thoughts on why and if you think that, if we should -- what implications you think that has for the next upcycle?\nDarren Field: So, listen Scott, there's a lot in your question there. Certainly, the bid cycle has always implemented at the same cadence that it did this year. We implement portions, big chunks, 30%, call it, of this pricing cycle throughout the second quarter. So I guess you could expect that something after the second quarter would entail all of that fully implemented. So, over time, I mean that, we did have negative pricing pressure. I don't have any guidance for you in terms of big step downs. There's certainly, I don't anticipate anything like that, but we're certainly getting everything fully implemented throughout the second quarter, and so the third quarter is a better reflection of the fully implemented pricing cycle. In terms of share gains, I mean, we have, I think, are dominating the Transcon marketplace. I do believe our volume growth there has been substantial. And we've highlighted that -- in the east, we have some significant headwinds from truckload pricing. I think that as we get into the second half of this year, we are optimistic about the discussions we're having with our customers about the value proposition that we represent, as well as concerns about highway capacity, and we will continue to look to grow. So that's probably all I have to comment on your questions today.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is open.\nDaniel Imbro: Yeah. Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe one, shifting to the Dedicated side. Nick, we continue to hear anecdotes of a competitive Dedicated market. Dedicated margins were a bit softer, kind of underperform seasonality and you sold a few hundred more trucks. I guess with 1,000 trucks sold in the first half, should those startup costs start to moderate as we move through the summer with that business online, where we start to see margin inflection as that rolls off, or how would you think about that business as we move through the summer?\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, well, first, thanks, Daniel, for the question. First, from startup cost, I would say we're just starting to see some of those startup costs come in. We had a pretty good chunk that's starting this month in July. And so you're going to see that a little bit in Q3. But that's a good thing for us. From a competitive standpoint, I would just say from our model and what we go after, we've been very disciplined in that. And so we've seen some competitiveness in retail in what I would call the basic retail replenishment is where we see most of our stiff competition, a little bit more aggressive pricing from some of the one-way truck models are quasi-dedicated in that segment. But in the other, I would just tell you our pipeline, as I said, is very solid. And you've seen the numbers that we've sold. So we think we still have a very good footing on what we're going to sell. We're just facing a little bit of pressure in some of those retail areas.\nBrad Delco: Daniel, hey, this is Brad Delco. I'll add a little bit more to that too, just to clarify some things that were in some of Nick\u2019s prepared comments. He did share he expected the ending fleet count for the year to be similar to what we saw in Q2. But how we really get there is, we do have visibility, some fleet losses for the remainder of the year. So think of losing trucks that are sort of at their mature state, if you will. And at the same time, we have startups that are -- that occur in Q3 and Q4, and obviously those startups have a little bit of headwind to them on the margin side. So we wanted to give a little bit more clarity on that. And that was our -- the comments we had in our prepared remarks were an attempt to sort of give you guys a little bit of forward guidance on that expectation going forward.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good afternoon. So I want to delve into kind of some of the discussion that your Transcon growth was up 5%. You talked about double digits from the West Coast ports, but they were seeing kind of mid-teens volume growth, kind of some conflicting statements. So you noted early peak season hitting shores, but some of that has yet to move. So I just want to understand are we building inventories? Are we seeing share loss to other rails that are now being more variable on rates for some of the peers that used to be on Burlington with you? I want to understand kind of the market dynamics in there, if you can.\nDarren Field: I would fully expect to outperform the domestic market on Southern California eastbound volume. So I don't believe we're losing share to any other domestic Intermodal channel. Now, in terms of during the pandemic window, so if I go back to 2020 through 2023, there was an uptick in the share of transload or domestic volume as a percentage of the imported goods through the Southern California or West Coast gateways. And that deteriorated so far in 2024. It's hard to say what's happened with that cargo. I don't believe it has moved domestically intermodally. I do believe that the share of intact international Intermodal is up slightly. Maybe that's because it converted from the East Coast to the West Coast, and on the East Coast it was intact, and it still is today, even though it's routing through the West Coast. We're constantly communicating with our customers, trying to learn more about what's happened with the mix of transload versus intact international. Is some of that import cargo moving into storage and will ship later? I would -- that's a reasonable question. I don't have a great answer for you on it, other than I'm confident that we're maintaining and growing our share of eastbound domestic Intermodal volumes from the West Coast. In terms of why the imports are as strong as they are and we're not necessarily keeping up with that, I don't know. We did highlight that our Southern California volumes were up double digits. I didn't tell you how many double digits. I just said double digits. So we feel good about our pipeline for eastbound California business, and we will continue to look to grow there and all other markets.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Good afternoon, everyone. Just shifting gears a little bit to talk about ICS, can you just unpack the kind of volume shift year-over-year, volume is down 25%, a little bit more kind of to give us a better understanding of what is going on there. I think you alluded to the BNSF business that you bought kind of being not quite what you expected. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more as well? Thank you.\nNick Hobbs: Yeah, Ravi. Thank you for the question. It's been an incredibly difficult and competitive market. That's certainly been a factor. As we stated in previous quarters, we've been focused largely on quality, and that's also weighed in on some of our volume losses. And in the commentary and my prepared remarks, I made reference to the impact of some of the challenges that we've had on the BNSF acquisition. And so really what we see there is that we lost some business shortly after acquiring the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics that were unexpected. We've also accelerated and I'm happy to say that we have been largely successful at integrating from a technology but that came with some incremental cost in the first half. And so that's also weighed us down. When we think about the bigger picture and where our focus has been, there's no doubt that we're dissatisfied with our performance in ICS. I am, however, encouraged at what we saw, and Spencer referenced it kind of on the seasonal trends. I think even Darren mentioned what they saw in their business. We saw something very similar, both not only in ICS but also in JBT when we really think about breaking down the second quarter month by month and we saw a really good step forward from our May volumes into our June volumes on a workday basis. And so, I feel like we saw a step-up greater than what we historically would see, and I do believe that in part that is our strategy starting to take form on growing back with quality partners, quality customers, and quality carriers. Again, can't quite see it fully in our results yet, but we took a nice step forward on our volumes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidel with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidel: Thank you, operator. I want to get back a little bit to the Intermodal side on the margins. How should we think about some of your commentary about lower utilization and increased cost related to equipment? Is that coming from the Walmart assets and how should I think about that sequentially?\nJohn Kuhlow: Jason, I mean our -- the acquisition of the Walmart equipment is -- hasn't really, it isn't fully inside our results at this point. So, I mean, we have more J.B. Hunt equipment, whether it's Walmart or our own, than what we're fully utilizing today. And so we have significant growth capacity. In previous quarterly calls, I have said, where we were able to handle as much as 20% more than what we are, and that certainly remains true today. So on the margin front, we have significant leverage to gain by adding volume and putting that equipment to work. But again, we also have negative pricing pressure at the current moment, which is also a headwind obviously to margin performance. Hey, relative to our industry I think we're doing okay in that area, but certainly we have an awful lot of work to do moving forward to get back to the returns we expect for our shareholders.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about how we think about year-over-year volume growth in Intermodal in second half. You did have some traction on volumes in 3Q, I think even more so in 4Q last year. So do you think we should be thinking about kind of worse year-over-year performance or there -- as the comps get tougher or do you have some visibility maybe to some momentum or Walmart loads coming in that would help you to kind of stay flattish on the year-over-year? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Well, I think as much as anything, and I'm going to ask Spencer to maybe jump in here when I'm done. Just our -- as we moved through the second quarter, we were feeling momentum and we've kind of tried to highlight that and do feel like our customers are aware that last year, they kind of caught us by surprise with some of that volume and everyone is aware that surprises are not always best when it comes to an efficient transportation network. So we're engaged in conversations with all of our customers. We have capacity to solve their needs, and we'll look for ways to continue to grow our business, both sequentially and year-over-year will always be our goal. We'll have to wait and see, but certainly we have felt some momentum as the second quarter went on.\nSpencer Frazier: Yeah, Darren, I'll share a few things. Tom, thanks for the question. We appreciate every customer that we have and all the conversations we have. One of the things as we look forward, they are talking about their peak season plans. But, when we ask for our customers' forecasts, that's an area they still struggle with. They've struggled in the past, they struggle today, and we really lean into our team, leveraging our data, sharing our expectations, and really collaborate with our customers from here to try to understand what they need and how we can set our ops teams up to serve them well. If we look at the end of the month and the end of the quarter, I don't think that two weeks is going to make a trend, or two months. What we need to do is get actual data from our customers and their expectations on what they anticipate their demand is going to be and then really set ourselves up to serve them well and that's really what we're focused on right now and looking forward to working with them to do that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Following up on the comments you just made about peak season, if we look -- the fourth quarter, you typically do see some sequential profit improvement, big holiday lift in Final Mile, some Intermodal, ICS and Truckload and maybe a more mixed performance in Dedicated. But, just high level, can you talk about the fundamental conditions that separate a normal to good peak season at Hunt from a disappointing one on the bottom line? And just, when would you have typically the customer conversations that would give you good visibility into how that peak season will actually play out? Thank you.\nShelley Simpson: Hey, Bascome. Thanks for the question. This is Shelley. I think Spencer did a nice job highlighting that we are having those conversations with our customers. I would tell you this is normally the time that we would be having those. And I think you heard Darren highlight that we're encouraged with more seasonal demand similar to what we've seen pre-pandemic. So I would tell you this looks and feels more like pre-2020. This would be consistent with how we had conversations with customers in the past. I think our customers have done a better job on their bid compliance and understanding their volume better. I think we're all just a little bit hesitant. We've had some false starts over the last couple of years, and we just want to make sure that things are steady and that we can see clear line of sight. I think our customers are even a little bit skittish about what they can expect. So, third and four quarter, last year, they did catch us by surprise. We did an outstanding job. Us, our railroad providers, I would say across the board, we did a great job servicing our customers. Our customers realized that. Now that's why we're having those conversations. What is the plan? How do we think about that? Certainly, if we move back to a more seasonal pattern, we would expect those same things to occur from a demand perspective and from a profitability perspective.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Shelley, maybe if we can follow up from there, and welcome to the hot seat of CEO, but this is the seventh quarter of material operating income declines for you guys. I mean, do share owners just at this point need to wait for an inflection in the market or is there more that you can do from your position? I mean, I know we talk about Highway conversions, but if we look back six or seven years, Intermodal volumes really haven't changed all that much in your business. It's the sixth consecutive quarter of pretty material losses at ICS. So what can you do in the interim to change outcomes in your business without the market maybe potentially inflexing better for you?\nShelley Simpson: Yeah, thank you, Brandon. Appreciate the comments. Certainly, our last two years has been the most difficult time in my 30-year career. It's been the most difficult time in predicting and understanding where our customers are headed and how we need to think about that from a quarter to quarter basis. But we are very focused on long-term. One thing we did learn from the pandemic was we weren't prepared and ready for our customers. And that was to the detriment of our long-term success. We have made strategic decisions to invest in our people, our technology and our capacity to be prepared and ready. I believe our customers know that and think that. I will tell you some of the things that you've heard from the businesses today and even in our past, we are preparing ourselves with best-in-class service. That, for us, means we want to separate the service levels we're giving our customers, so they know they can expect that from J.B. Hunt on a consistent basis, and then creating more value for our customers. We do look at it long-term and we also recognize that we have to deliver long-term returns for our shareholders. We think this is the best strategy that sets us up for that long-term. I think in our conversations with customers today, we're encouraged with some of the comments that they're making towards us in the areas that we're heavily focused on. And so I would tell you ICS, we're not pleased with our performance in ICS, we're not pleased with our performance, I would say to our expectations, but our relative performance has been pretty good. That doesn't mean that we're happy. But when I look at where we're at relative to the competition and how we are doing from a market share gain, a profitability perspective, our return profile, those three areas, we're making progress, and that's what we're going to continue to focus on. I will say this, as we move here into second quarter and moving here into third quarter, one thing we do know is, we're at least closer to calling some kind of inflection. Not that we're calling it today, but I will say there are signs that tell us that things are moderating or getting better. We are skittish. I've been conditioned now over the last two years to be very cautious on the things that we say. And I think you're hearing a tone that says, listen, we have better signals. It doesn't mean that they're great. And we need more information from our customers to get us better. Today is the time for us to make sure that we're close to our customers, that we're prepared and ready. But I will tell you, we are not changing our targets. We have a long-term goal across all of our businesses to make sure we deliver appropriate returns to our shareholders. That will be our focus. We think we're taking the best strategic decision and move to make sure that we accomplish that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much, and congratulations, Shelley. I guess I just want to think about this bigger picture because this downturn, I think, surprised everybody in terms of the magnitude and the duration. And here we are still seeing pricing trends coming in weaker than expected. Even though volume feels a little bit more seasonal, there's no real view of any catalyst for acceleration. I guess looking back on this, what do you think we got wrong about the magnitude of this turn? And, what do you think it takes to catalyze us back forward on the volume and pricing side?\nShelley Simpson: Well, thank you, Jeff. Good question. I will say, I think one of the things that we didn't understand, same thing we didn't understand going through the pandemic, was how much the change would occur. And so if I look back on our experience, in 2009, we had the Great Recession. We understood and we were prepared and ready. One of the changes that happened then, as price went downwards during that Great Recession, so did our cost. We're in an inflationary cost perspective with price pressure coming down. And those two things really is the first time I've seen that, at least in my history inside the organization. I don't know that anybody believes those two things would occur as they have. You typically look at history, try to learn from what you know there, and then make sure you're prepared and ready. That, I would say, was more of a disconnect than maybe what we expected. And then just the depth, one of the things that we've used in our history is what's happened with capacity. And so we've estimated that carriers are losing money for now greater than two years. That is unusual. It's unusual from our history. That typically would mean that capacity would come out of the market and that we would start the recovery. That has not happened, and I think that's been the biggest myth of this last two years of a freight recession. We haven't been able to predict when capacity will leave the market, and we know that that has to occur, or demand has to pick up greater. But I would tell you, more likelihood that the capacity side would exit more quickly than demand would increase even more. So I would say those are the two things. I'm going to ask the team if there's anything else that they see. But those would be kind of the two things I would say that we -- if we'd known better, we probably could have thought through a few things.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thanks for being here. I just wanted to ask a question about within the Intermodal service, can you give us some context or color around how the Quantum product is performing that you guys announced a little while ago? And then with the shift over of the Mexican traffic from the KCS to Mexico [to the FXE] (ph). I'm just wondering if you could just give us an update on how that transition is going? Has there been any impact on customer attrition or anything like that in the North South trade? Thank you.\nDarren Field: Sure. So, Quantum, we're absolutely thrilled with the service performance. I think we're actually outpacing even expectations of our customers. Now, that being said, the complexity of the networks and the decision point for a shipper to convert Highway business that we would call cannot fail, the kind of Highway business that's not just inventory replenishment, it's a business-to-business transaction kind of move, has probably been a little more complicated and a little slower than what we have anticipated. So, while our volume benefits from the Quantum program have not yet been achieved, we're absolutely encouraged by what we're experiencing with the service, the feedback from the customers that are utilizing that service, and we're growing it every day. It hasn't grown as fast as we probably would have anticipated, but we've got a very long runway of opportunity to grow with the Quantum product, and we're thrilled with that. As it relates to the announcement about the transition to Ferromex from CPKC at the beginning of the year, I think the transition was successful. Again, customers are clearly concerned about a transition like that. And maybe not everybody on day one converted with us at the pace that we would have probably liked to have seen that happen. As the year has gone on, we have had a lot of success at going and recovering business that maybe didn't transition with us. And hey, our volume swing on the Ferromex was a material change in their network. And the BNSF's ability to serve Eagle Pass has been excellent. So we feel good about all three parties involved in that program. But certainly the customer education around customs and all things related to the new terminals that we operate at with Ferromex was an education and that has taken a little longer and probably didn't result in quite as much transition to our network immediately, but again as the years gone on, I feel good about where we're at today and there's more work to be done to grow our presence in Mexico as the year moves on.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back to Ms. Shelley Simpson for closing remarks.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, and thanks for joining our call. You've heard us talk about our challenges in the business, and although we're pleased with the relative performance, we're not pleased with our own expectations. We've seen pressure from our customers, our costs in all of our businesses. Pricing's largely been reset through this season for our transactional businesses in Intermodal, ICS, and JBT, and that pricing will largely be in place until we complete this season midway through 2025. And during this freight recession, we've invested in our foundations of our people and our technology and our capacity, and that's really been preparing for a long-term opportunity to grow with our customers, and we're encouraged in a few areas. Our DCS and Final Mile businesses have fared very well in this recession. I am pleased with the margin of performance and the resiliency of our DCS business and the improvement in our Final Mile business on both profit and returns. Our customer demand is returning back to something more seasonal that we can be better at predicting to pre-pandemic levels, and that gives us more confidence as we're looking at bid compliance better between 80% and 90% in both Intermodal and JBT. And that means our customers are doing a better job predicting their consistent volumes. We're also encouraged with our pipeline and the conversations we're having with customers around our growth plan and our peak planning. And finally, very pleased with our people. There's 33,000 of our people working hard every day to deliver on the expectations of our customers and our shareholders. We're going to continue to focus on controlling our costs. We will provide best-in-class service. We're going to maintain our excellence in safety, and we'll create value for customers. And that's what sets us up for growth. That scales our investments, and it allows us to create long-term value for our people and our shareholders. Thank you for your comments and your interest on the call. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren, and good afternoon everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments while also providing an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive with pressure on both volume and rate. Segment gross revenue declined 21% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by a 25% decline in volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue per load. As you have heard, we did see some seasonality in the business with some relative tightness in the market around road checks and in the later part of June. That said, our gross margins for the quarter were 14.8%, the highest we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2022, which is noteworthy, given 61% of our volumes are under contract. We continue to focus on quality revenue and growing with the right customers as our yield performance indicates. Admittedly, we are incurring some challenges integrating the previously announced acquisition of BNSF Logistics, but remain encouraged and optimistic about the potential of the agent model on our platform. These challenges are masking some of the underlying progress we are seeing in our legacy ICS business. Going forward, we will remain focused on further right-sizing our cost structure, but ultimately, we need to push more volume through our platform in order to see material improvements in our results. Moving over to JBT or Truckload, segment gross revenue was down 12% year-over-year, driven by a 9% decrease in volume and a 4% decrease in revenue per load. This season was competitive and we opted to remain disciplined on price, which resulted in some lost volume. That said, we are focused on attracting the right freight that best fits our network with the right customers that see the value of our service and network of trailing capacity. While we currently have excess trailing capacity in our network, we are working on ensuring discipline around our network to ensure that we have the right capacity in the right markets where our customers have needs and where they are growing. We hear from customers that they appreciate our high service levels and the flexibility that our drop trailer offering provides to their supply chain. Our model allows us to be more variable with our costs depending on the market, which we believe ultimately presents us with opportunities to scale this cost competitive service offering for customers while ensuring we generate an appropriate return on capital. Going forward, our focus is on improving our trailer utilization rate while ensuring our capacity remains balanced across the network. I'll close with some comments on J.B. Hunt 360. Technology enables our people, helps drive productivity, and also drives efficiency in how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. Technology is foundational to our company, but it's also created opportunities for strategic theft groups to impact our operations. We continue to deploy enhancements to our system to increase the security of our platform and have become much more stringent on carrier vetting to mitigate cargo theft risk, which continues to be very prevalent in the industry and in particular for our customers who are feeling the impact. Long-term, technology investments will continue to drive productivity and efficiency gains across the scroll and better position us for long-term growth with our customers. That concludes my comments. So, I'll turn it back to the operator who will open the call for questions."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley, and good afternoon, everyone. Similar to recent quarters, my comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter and provide an update on our cost control efforts while also balancing our investments to support future growth. I'll close with an update on our capital allocation plan for the remainder of 2024. As a general overview, while we have seen some moderation in inflationary cost pressures, the deflationary rate environment continues to pressure our margin performance. Let me start with a quick review of the second quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to the prior year period, revenue declined 7%, operating income declined 24%, and diluted earnings per share decreased 27%. A combination of either lower volumes and/or yields, but most notably lower rates, were the main drivers of the lower revenue primarily in our Intermodal and Highway Services businesses, which includes our brokerage business in ICS and our drop trailer business in JBT. Our tax rate in the quarter was slightly elevated at 26.8%. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to fall in the range of 24% to 25%. While we have seen improvements across many of our cost categories, the lower revenue continue to put pressure on our margins across our business segments, with the exception of FMS and JBT, which improved operating margins year-over-year. We have been thoughtful and thorough in our approach to managing our costs. Last quarter, we quantified what our commitments to investing in our business through this downturn represented, which was in aggregate $100 million on an annual basis. We continue to focus our cost efforts in areas that would not prohibit our ability to support our future growth or our future earnings power. These costs are primarily related to our investments in two of our company foundations, namely our people and our capacity. As to be expected, the majority of these costs are burdened in our JBI business, and also, but to a lesser extent, our ICS and JBT segments. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to grow our business to scale into these investments. Wrapping up with an update to our 2024 capital plan, we are updating our guidance for net capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. This compares to our previous expectation of $800 million to $1 billion. Keep in mind, this does include the previously announced purchase of Walmart's Intermodal assets. This reduced plan largely reflects a moderation of both tractor and trailing fleet additions in addition to real estate projects. While our earnings performance has been under pressure, our leverage at the end of the quarter was 0.9 times EBITDA, below our target of 1 times. We also purchased just over $200 million of stock in the quarter. With our updated and reduced net capital expenditure plan, current market dynamics, and our view of where we are in the cycle, we believe a disciplined approach to share repurchases is a prudent use of capital at this time. This concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn it over to Spencer. Jason, I mean our -- the acquisition of the Walmart equipment is -- hasn't really, it isn't fully inside our results at this point. So, I mean, we have more J.B. Hunt equipment, whether it's Walmart or our own, than what we're fully utilizing today. And so we have significant growth capacity. In previous quarterly calls, I have said, where we were able to handle as much as 20% more than what we are, and that certainly remains true today. So on the margin front, we have significant leverage to gain by adding volume and putting that equipment to work. But again, we also have negative pricing pressure at the current moment, which is also a headwind obviously to margin performance. Hey, relative to our industry I think we're doing okay in that area, but certainly we have an awful lot of work to do moving forward to get back to the returns we expect for our shareholders."

            "content": "Thanks, Spencer, and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on Dedicated, Final Mile Business, and give an update on our areas of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. While we are not immune to the impact of the overall market, we believe our results during the quarter continue to highlight the strength and resiliency of our unique, Dedicated business model. We believe our differentiation is supported by our focus on providing professional, outsourced private fleet solutions to a broad and diverse group of customers, in addition to our relentless focus on delivering value to our customers. During the second quarter, we sold 325 trucks of new deals. While we have visibility to some losses or downsizing throughout 2024, our sales pipeline remains solid and our team has done well to backfill some of those losses. Despite the challenging market conditions, importantly, we have remained committed to our discipline in the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return thresholds. With a proven track record of high service levels and our ability to create value for our customers, we continue to have success onboarding new business and renewing business with our existing customers. We remain confident in our ability to execute on the transportation needs of our customers and the opportunity to further compound our growth over many years. Going forward, despite our strong new truck sales in the first half of the year, I would expect our fleet count to end the year relatively flat from our Q2 levels, with some additional startup expenses as new trucks are brought into the fleet. Shifting to Final Mile. I continue to be pleased with our progress we have made to improve the overall health of this business. This journey started many years ago as we focused on a differentiated high quality service to then focusing on revenue quality and remaining cost discipline throughout the process. The market for big and bulky delivery continues to evolve and customers are looking for a high quality, safe and secure service provider with national scale. For transparency purposes, our second quarter results did include a net benefit of $1.1 million from two offsetting claims settlements. Demand for big and bulky products remain mixed with stable demand for both appliances and exercise equipment, but continued softness in furniture demand. We remain modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. We continue to strive to provide the highest level as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customer with a focus on being safe and secure. We will remain disciplined with potential new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while we work to grow the business and improve profitability. Going forward, we would expect some customer churn as we continue to focus on revenue quality, but for margin performance to follow fairly normal seasonal patterns, excluding the unique item called out in the quarter. Similar to the last quarters, I'll close with some comments on safety. Our company was built on a foundation of safety for not only our people but also the motoring public and we continue to invest in training and equipment to enhance our already strong safety culture. We continue to lead the industry with our fleet that is now over 97% rolled out with inward-facing cameras and we remain on track to be 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. As you may recall, 2023 was our best safety performance on record for DOT preventable accidents per million miles. And I'm pleased to say, with the help of our inward facing cameras, along with our numerous other innovative safety initiatives, we are seeing further improvements so far here today. This is a testament to the quality of our drivers and the safety culture of our company as the cost of claims continues to move up exponentially, we remain focused on finding new innovative ways to further enhance our safety performance and mitigate risk where possible. This concludes my remarks. So, I would like to now turn it over to Darren. Yeah, well, first, thanks, Daniel, for the question. First, from startup cost, I would say we're just starting to see some of those startup costs come in. We had a pretty good chunk that's starting this month in July. And so you're going to see that a little bit in Q3. But that's a good thing for us. From a competitive standpoint, I would just say from our model and what we go after, we've been very disciplined in that. And so we've seen some competitiveness in retail in what I would call the basic retail replenishment is where we see most of our stiff competition, a little bit more aggressive pricing from some of the one-way truck models are quasi-dedicated in that segment. But in the other, I would just tell you our pipeline, as I said, is very solid. And you've seen the numbers that we've sold. So we think we still have a very good footing on what we're going to sell. We're just facing a little bit of pressure in some of those retail areas. Yeah, Ravi. Thank you for the question. It's been an incredibly difficult and competitive market. That's certainly been a factor. As we stated in previous quarters, we've been focused largely on quality, and that's also weighed in on some of our volume losses. And in the commentary and my prepared remarks, I made reference to the impact of some of the challenges that we've had on the BNSF acquisition. And so really what we see there is that we lost some business shortly after acquiring the brokerage assets of BNSF Logistics that were unexpected. We've also accelerated and I'm happy to say that we have been largely successful at integrating from a technology but that came with some incremental cost in the first half. And so that's also weighed us down. When we think about the bigger picture and where our focus has been, there's no doubt that we're dissatisfied with our performance in ICS. I am, however, encouraged at what we saw, and Spencer referenced it kind of on the seasonal trends. I think even Darren mentioned what they saw in their business. We saw something very similar, both not only in ICS but also in JBT when we really think about breaking down the second quarter month by month and we saw a really good step forward from our May volumes into our June volumes on a workday basis. And so, I feel like we saw a step-up greater than what we historically would see, and I do believe that in part that is our strategy starting to take form on growing back with quality partners, quality customers, and quality carriers. Again, can't quite see it fully in our results yet, but we took a nice step forward on our volumes."

            "name": "Shelley Simpson",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start by saying I'm humbled and honored to have recently assumed the role of CEO and to lead our great company on the next phase of our growth journey. While recognizing this is a big moment as only the fifth organizational leader in our company's 62-year history, let me be clear our vision, our mission, and our focus has not changed. We have large addressable markets. We provide excellent service for customers. We have talented people across our organization. We are primed and we are ready to execute on our opportunities for growth. My message to the team on day one was quite simple, ready, set, go. As you've heard us say consistently, we remain committed to our investments and managing the business with a long-term mindset. These investments span across our company foundations, which include our people, our technology, and our capacity. Through investments in these key areas, we have a significant number of opportunities to provide value to and on behalf of our customers across our suite of complementary service offerings. Our focus remains on deploying capital in areas of the transportation industry where we see a long-term opportunity to generate compounding returns. We operate in an industry that is cyclical, but we have focused on businesses and areas that we feel confident we can compete effectively, take share, and win. We do this by remaining financially disciplined, keeping our focus on the long-term while managing costs in the near term, and relying on our vast experience. We will be prepared to meet the growing needs of our customers while driving long-term growth for the company and our shareholders. Earlier this year, we introduced our priorities for 2024, and we as a management team and as an organization continue to execute on these priorities, which as a reminder are, one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence. Two, scale our long-term investment in our company foundations, which are people, technology, and capacity. And three, drive long-term value and returns for our shareholders. While the first half of this year has been challenging in terms of our financial performance, we remain focused on delivering exceptional value to our customers. In 2024, we've continued our record performance in safety and our service levels to customers has been exceptional. We have received multiple awards this year for our high service level from our customers. Our joint Intermodal service offering with BNSF, Quantum, is running well above our initial expectation from an on-time service performance. In Dedicated, we continue to prove our value to customers as we've been able to balance the need to be disciplined with underwriting new business while providing customers some flexibility with meeting their needs. Final Mile continues to make progress on its profit improvement plan and we continue to work on areas around cost, integration, and growth in ICS, and see some progress in the business. Finally, we remain encouraged about the value proposition for customers in our drop trailing business in JBT and the future potential of that business. While admittedly the market has been challenging, we have invested throughout this downturn to set us up for future growth and success across the business. We continue to focus on controlling expenses in the near term without jeopardizing our long-term potential, managing our headcount through attrition, while at the same time continuing to deploy and enhance our technology to increase the productivity of our people. We took advantage of a strategic opportunity to acquire the Intermodal assets from Walmart earlier this year, which added capacity to our network, but also increased the long-term growth potential of our company, which we believe will drive long-term returns for both the company and our shareholders. The team will provide more details with their prepared comments, but in summary, we will stay the course, focus on the long term, with the same vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Hey, Bascome. Thanks for the question. This is Shelley. I think Spencer did a nice job highlighting that we are having those conversations with our customers. I would tell you this is normally the time that we would be having those. And I think you heard Darren highlight that we're encouraged with more seasonal demand similar to what we've seen pre-pandemic. So I would tell you this looks and feels more like pre-2020. This would be consistent with how we had conversations with customers in the past. I think our customers have done a better job on their bid compliance and understanding their volume better. I think we're all just a little bit hesitant. We've had some false starts over the last couple of years, and we just want to make sure that things are steady and that we can see clear line of sight. I think our customers are even a little bit skittish about what they can expect. So, third and four quarter, last year, they did catch us by surprise. We did an outstanding job. Us, our railroad providers, I would say across the board, we did a great job servicing our customers. Our customers realized that. Now that's why we're having those conversations. What is the plan? How do we think about that? Certainly, if we move back to a more seasonal pattern, we would expect those same things to occur from a demand perspective and from a profitability perspective. Yeah, thank you, Brandon. Appreciate the comments. Certainly, our last two years has been the most difficult time in my 30-year career. It's been the most difficult time in predicting and understanding where our customers are headed and how we need to think about that from a quarter to quarter basis. But we are very focused on long-term. One thing we did learn from the pandemic was we weren't prepared and ready for our customers. And that was to the detriment of our long-term success. We have made strategic decisions to invest in our people, our technology and our capacity to be prepared and ready. I believe our customers know that and think that. I will tell you some of the things that you've heard from the businesses today and even in our past, we are preparing ourselves with best-in-class service. That, for us, means we want to separate the service levels we're giving our customers, so they know they can expect that from J.B. Hunt on a consistent basis, and then creating more value for our customers. We do look at it long-term and we also recognize that we have to deliver long-term returns for our shareholders. We think this is the best strategy that sets us up for that long-term. I think in our conversations with customers today, we're encouraged with some of the comments that they're making towards us in the areas that we're heavily focused on. And so I would tell you ICS, we're not pleased with our performance in ICS, we're not pleased with our performance, I would say to our expectations, but our relative performance has been pretty good. That doesn't mean that we're happy. But when I look at where we're at relative to the competition and how we are doing from a market share gain, a profitability perspective, our return profile, those three areas, we're making progress, and that's what we're going to continue to focus on. I will say this, as we move here into second quarter and moving here into third quarter, one thing we do know is, we're at least closer to calling some kind of inflection. Not that we're calling it today, but I will say there are signs that tell us that things are moderating or getting better. We are skittish. I've been conditioned now over the last two years to be very cautious on the things that we say. And I think you're hearing a tone that says, listen, we have better signals. It doesn't mean that they're great. And we need more information from our customers to get us better. Today is the time for us to make sure that we're close to our customers, that we're prepared and ready. But I will tell you, we are not changing our targets. We have a long-term goal across all of our businesses to make sure we deliver appropriate returns to our shareholders. That will be our focus. We think we're taking the best strategic decision and move to make sure that we accomplish that. Well, thank you, Jeff. Good question. I will say, I think one of the things that we didn't understand, same thing we didn't understand going through the pandemic, was how much the change would occur. And so if I look back on our experience, in 2009, we had the Great Recession. We understood and we were prepared and ready. One of the changes that happened then, as price went downwards during that Great Recession, so did our cost. We're in an inflationary cost perspective with price pressure coming down. And those two things really is the first time I've seen that, at least in my history inside the organization. I don't know that anybody believes those two things would occur as they have. You typically look at history, try to learn from what you know there, and then make sure you're prepared and ready. That, I would say, was more of a disconnect than maybe what we expected. And then just the depth, one of the things that we've used in our history is what's happened with capacity. And so we've estimated that carriers are losing money for now greater than two years. That is unusual. It's unusual from our history. That typically would mean that capacity would come out of the market and that we would start the recovery. That has not happened, and I think that's been the biggest myth of this last two years of a freight recession. We haven't been able to predict when capacity will leave the market, and we know that that has to occur, or demand has to pick up greater. But I would tell you, more likelihood that the capacity side would exit more quickly than demand would increase even more. So I would say those are the two things. I'm going to ask the team if there's anything else that they see. But those would be kind of the two things I would say that we -- if we'd known better, we probably could have thought through a few things. Thank you, and thanks for joining our call. You've heard us talk about our challenges in the business, and although we're pleased with the relative performance, we're not pleased with our own expectations. We've seen pressure from our customers, our costs in all of our businesses. Pricing's largely been reset through this season for our transactional businesses in Intermodal, ICS, and JBT, and that pricing will largely be in place until we complete this season midway through 2025. And during this freight recession, we've invested in our foundations of our people and our technology and our capacity, and that's really been preparing for a long-term opportunity to grow with our customers, and we're encouraged in a few areas. Our DCS and Final Mile businesses have fared very well in this recession. I am pleased with the margin of performance and the resiliency of our DCS business and the improvement in our Final Mile business on both profit and returns. Our customer demand is returning back to something more seasonal that we can be better at predicting to pre-pandemic levels, and that gives us more confidence as we're looking at bid compliance better between 80% and 90% in both Intermodal and JBT. And that means our customers are doing a better job predicting their consistent volumes. We're also encouraged with our pipeline and the conversations we're having with customers around our growth plan and our peak planning. And finally, very pleased with our people. There's 33,000 of our people working hard every day to deliver on the expectations of our customers and our shareholders. We're going to continue to focus on controlling our costs. We will provide best-in-class service. We're going to maintain our excellence in safety, and we'll create value for customers. And that's what sets us up for growth. That scales our investments, and it allows us to create long-term value for our people and our shareholders. Thank you for your comments and your interest on the call. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of our Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance, and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, while we saw seasonality that resembled more normalized pre-pandemic demand trends during the quarter, the impact of a depressed truckload market and competitive bid season in general, more than offset this and drove our volume down 1% year-over-year. This was primarily driven in the east where we compete more directly with one-way truckload where our volumes were down 7% in the quarter. This was partially offset by our Transcon business growing 4% in the quarter. We continue to see strong demand out of Southern California where volumes were up double digits versus the prior year. By month, our consolidated volumes were down 3% in April, up 1% in May, and down 1% in June. During June, we did see a nice seasonal lift in volume, particularly toward the end of the month, and importantly, we were able to meet our customers' capacity needs with strong service levels, highlighting the strength and flexibility of our network. As we look at the freight market, we continue to see a large amount of freight that we believe should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal as it is more economical and environmentally friendly. As I've said it before and I want to say it again, we stand ready and have the capacity and people in place to meet and exceed our customer service needs and recapture share from the highway moving forward. During the quarter, we did see margin pressure both year-over-year and sequentially. This is largely related to the market pressure on our yields but also due to our capacity investments. While volume does mean more to us now than ever before given our underutilized capacity, our modestly lower volume year-over-year and only slightly higher volumes sequentially wasn't enough to absorb our higher cost and deflationary yield pressure. As discussed earlier in the year, bid season was competitive and largely wrapped up during the second quarter. We continued to see truckload pricing that we believe is unsustainable, particularly in the east, and shippers took advantage. Given the nature of our pricing cycle, we will be living with a large portion of the recently completed bids into the first half of 2025. With regard to our rail service providers, we have been pleased with the service from each of our providers, their commitment to the intermodal offering and growing the overall market. That said, we and our railroad partners know the true test of our collective service will come once freight volumes increase with higher overall demand on our networks. We remain confident in the collaborative work and investments being made to maintain high service levels as the inflection occurs. In closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. Our service levels are exceptional and we are confident that this level of service can continue as our customers' overall demand for our capacity increases. While we are not pleased with our current results, our optimism on the future growth of our business hasn't changed. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient, cost competitive, and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Yeah, I appreciate the question. Certainly, Spencer's comments just on overall imports through Southern California is one of many factors resulting in just a general improving trends throughout the first quarter -- or throughout that second quarter. I do want to highlight, we referenced a negative 1% volume comp in June. June of \u201823 had two more working days than June of \u201824, and so that's certainly an influencer in that comparison. But again, as the quarter went on, we experienced some improving trends from our customers. I also highlighted in the prepared comments that we were up double digits out of Southern California for the entirety of the second quarter. So certainly some customers would highlight that maybe that was a result of early shipments for peak season. Some customers highlighted that generally their business had improved. And in some cases, we had converted back Highway business to Intermodal. So, it's kind of a mash of everything to see some improvements that occurred during the quarter. Well, certainly we highlighted that this current, what I'll call the 2024 bid cycle, largely completed during the second quarter. Those prices and the yields that we achieved were not strong enough to give us margin improvement that we believe our system can and should run. We're not changing our long-term margin target. We're not satisfied with the current returns on our business and do recognize that pricing improvement is one of a couple of areas, but the most important area in order to get margin improvement. Certainly, volume is worth more to us today than ever before. We've said that quite often, and that's just a result of having as much underutilized equipment as we currently have. And then all things cost. What can we do to be more efficient as an organization? That can be inside the activities of our drivers and our drayage operation, that can be certainly inside the activities of our people. How do we utilize technology better? How can we just be more efficient with our customers? But over the long term, pricing will always be the most valuable element to improving margins more than volume or just operational efficiency, but we will work on all three every day. It's really -- a pricing implementation element is probably the largest driving factor behind the non-normal seasonal sequential change in profitability. Certainly the implementation of the bid cycle has been a headwind to seeing earnings improve. We will say it often, volume will be our leading indicator and pricing will always lag volume. And so as we find our way through the rest of the year and look for opportunities to grow our business, we believe over the long term, certainly pricing improvements will lag that volume. So, listen Scott, there's a lot in your question there. Certainly, the bid cycle has always implemented at the same cadence that it did this year. We implement portions, big chunks, 30%, call it, of this pricing cycle throughout the second quarter. So I guess you could expect that something after the second quarter would entail all of that fully implemented. So, over time, I mean that, we did have negative pricing pressure. I don't have any guidance for you in terms of big step downs. There's certainly, I don't anticipate anything like that, but we're certainly getting everything fully implemented throughout the second quarter, and so the third quarter is a better reflection of the fully implemented pricing cycle. In terms of share gains, I mean, we have, I think, are dominating the Transcon marketplace. I do believe our volume growth there has been substantial. And we've highlighted that -- in the east, we have some significant headwinds from truckload pricing. I think that as we get into the second half of this year, we are optimistic about the discussions we're having with our customers about the value proposition that we represent, as well as concerns about highway capacity, and we will continue to look to grow. So that's probably all I have to comment on your questions today. I would fully expect to outperform the domestic market on Southern California eastbound volume. So I don't believe we're losing share to any other domestic Intermodal channel. Now, in terms of during the pandemic window, so if I go back to 2020 through 2023, there was an uptick in the share of transload or domestic volume as a percentage of the imported goods through the Southern California or West Coast gateways. And that deteriorated so far in 2024. It's hard to say what's happened with that cargo. I don't believe it has moved domestically intermodally. I do believe that the share of intact international Intermodal is up slightly. Maybe that's because it converted from the East Coast to the West Coast, and on the East Coast it was intact, and it still is today, even though it's routing through the West Coast. We're constantly communicating with our customers, trying to learn more about what's happened with the mix of transload versus intact international. Is some of that import cargo moving into storage and will ship later? I would -- that's a reasonable question. I don't have a great answer for you on it, other than I'm confident that we're maintaining and growing our share of eastbound domestic Intermodal volumes from the West Coast. In terms of why the imports are as strong as they are and we're not necessarily keeping up with that, I don't know. We did highlight that our Southern California volumes were up double digits. I didn't tell you how many double digits. I just said double digits. So we feel good about our pipeline for eastbound California business, and we will continue to look to grow there and all other markets. Well, I think as much as anything, and I'm going to ask Spencer to maybe jump in here when I'm done. Just our -- as we moved through the second quarter, we were feeling momentum and we've kind of tried to highlight that and do feel like our customers are aware that last year, they kind of caught us by surprise with some of that volume and everyone is aware that surprises are not always best when it comes to an efficient transportation network. So we're engaged in conversations with all of our customers. We have capacity to solve their needs, and we'll look for ways to continue to grow our business, both sequentially and year-over-year will always be our goal. We'll have to wait and see, but certainly we have felt some momentum as the second quarter went on. Sure. So, Quantum, we're absolutely thrilled with the service performance. I think we're actually outpacing even expectations of our customers. Now, that being said, the complexity of the networks and the decision point for a shipper to convert Highway business that we would call cannot fail, the kind of Highway business that's not just inventory replenishment, it's a business-to-business transaction kind of move, has probably been a little more complicated and a little slower than what we have anticipated. So, while our volume benefits from the Quantum program have not yet been achieved, we're absolutely encouraged by what we're experiencing with the service, the feedback from the customers that are utilizing that service, and we're growing it every day. It hasn't grown as fast as we probably would have anticipated, but we've got a very long runway of opportunity to grow with the Quantum product, and we're thrilled with that. As it relates to the announcement about the transition to Ferromex from CPKC at the beginning of the year, I think the transition was successful. Again, customers are clearly concerned about a transition like that. And maybe not everybody on day one converted with us at the pace that we would have probably liked to have seen that happen. As the year has gone on, we have had a lot of success at going and recovering business that maybe didn't transition with us. And hey, our volume swing on the Ferromex was a material change in their network. And the BNSF's ability to serve Eagle Pass has been excellent. So we feel good about all three parties involved in that program. But certainly the customer education around customs and all things related to the new terminals that we operate at with Ferromex was an education and that has taken a little longer and probably didn't result in quite as much transition to our network immediately, but again as the years gone on, I feel good about where we're at today and there's more work to be done to grow our presence in Mexico as the year moves on."

            "name": "Spencer Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be joining the call. My remarks will focus on our sales and marketing strategy, but will also include some perspectives on the market, as well as feedback we are hearing from our customers. During the second quarter, we saw more normalized seasonal patterns across our business. On the demand side, the second quarter felt more like what we're accustomed to seeing prior to the pandemic disruption. April started a little slower from a demand perspective, primarily due to the timing of Easter, but we did experience what used to be a typical end of month and end of quarter lift in June. This was evidenced particularly in both JBI and JBT in the quarter, where we've seen strong improvements in bid compliance levels in the mid-80s to 90s levels, which we haven't seen in quite some time. We were able to meet this seasonal demand for our customers with high service levels across our businesses. Our customers have worked through most of their excess inventory and feel appropriately right-sized with current sales activity levels. While we cannot predict when the market will inflect, our customers know we stand ready to meet their growing transportation needs across our entire scroll of services. Regarding our scroll, our customers buy capacity across our suite of services and have come to expect a consistent high service level experience. In fact, greater than 90% of our Top 100 customers buy more than one service from us and greater than 75% buy from three or more services. Among our segments, JBI and ICS have the highest overlap amongst our Top 100 customers. We see the power of the scroll in our sales efforts as customers have recently wanted to de-emphasize their use of brokers in favor of assets. And we've converted some nice wins over to JBT as a result. Being mode-indifferent and offering customers the best solution will always guide our go-to-market strategy. As we look at the overall freight market, we still see oversupply across all modes, with shippers having options on both mode and provider to move their freight. Now, while capacity is not a top concern right now, there is an awareness that this will change at some point, but the timing of which though remains unclear. Currently, cost and value are the primary differentiators right now for customers, and we continue to lean into the value we can deliver to customers with our premium service. As we have said in previous quarters, we don't know when the cycle will shift and aren't going to make a prediction. But we remain committed to investing in our business for the long term and being ready to grow with our customers over many years to solve their transportation needs with high service levels they've come to expect from J.B. Hunt. I'll wrap up with some of the feedback we're getting regarding peak season. We see the same datasets that most of you track and read the same headlines around what's happening in the ocean freight market. The feedback we hear is an expectation for a peak season this year, but the magnitude or length of peak remains to be seen. That said, some customers have pulled a portion of their peak freight forward a couple months, given the multiple macro factors that could impact the supply chain later this year. This pull forward has created an early peak on the water, but that hasn't translated into domestic inland moves just yet. We are working with customers on peak season plans to ensure we have resources properly positioned to meet their transportation needs. That concludes my remarks. So, I would now like to turn the call over to Nick. Yeah, and hey, John, this is Spencer. I'd just like to add a little bit to that. When I talk about normal seasonal trends, I think that's something that we really need to think about across our customer base. Normal seasonal trends end of month, end of quarter, in Q2 really are related to back to school, things that are prepping for that season, for other events that take place here in July with different promotional things. So, I'm encouraged from our customer base that really normal seasonality started to show up for us. And I think that's something that we're going to be looking forward to as we move on. I think that in the prior years, we struggled really with seeing seasonal trends in a normal way. There was just still so much disruption. So, appreciate the question, just wanted to add those comments. Yeah, Darren, I'll share a few things. Tom, thanks for the question. We appreciate every customer that we have and all the conversations we have. One of the things as we look forward, they are talking about their peak season plans. But, when we ask for our customers' forecasts, that's an area they still struggle with. They've struggled in the past, they struggle today, and we really lean into our team, leveraging our data, sharing our expectations, and really collaborate with our customers from here to try to understand what they need and how we can set our ops teams up to serve them well. If we look at the end of the month and the end of the quarter, I don't think that two weeks is going to make a trend, or two months. What we need to do is get actual data from our customers and their expectations on what they anticipate their demand is going to be and then really set ourselves up to serve them well and that's really what we're focused on right now and looking forward to working with them to do that."

This afternoon, I'm joined by our CEO, John Roberts; our President, Shelley Simpson; our CFO, John Kuhlow; Nick Hobbs, COO and President of Contract Services; Darren Field, President of Intermodal; and Brad Hicks, President of Highway Services and EVP of People. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. John Roberts, for some owing comments. John?\nJohn Roberts: Thank you, Brad and good afternoon. I will be brief with my comments but I want to hit on a few topics before I turn it over to our team to give you their updates and to address your questions. Last quarter, we said goodbye and good riddance to 2023 and welcomed the new year with some reservations and concerns but nonetheless confident in the strength of our organization and the journey we are on to build an even bigger and better company. Over the last several years, you have heard us talk about how we manage the business for the long term, remain focused on being financially disciplined and being for our people who have the knowledge and talent to help us execute for and on behalf of our customers. From that perspective, nothing has changed and we remain committed to staying the course. Over that same time, we have faced challenges, have taken some calculated risks and made some strategic decisions that I remain confident will positively impact our company and our future growth. To be fair and somewhat critical, the current environment we're in has remained persistently challenging and for longer than we had predicted. But what I remain confident in is the strategic decisions and the direction and course we are on is well charted. Our conservative nature, financial discipline and coming from a position of strength has afforded us the opportunity to invest throughout this period to better prepare us for the eventual turn. We stand ready. Our company and our teams are working hard. To use a sports analogy, we are putting in the work, exercising the muscles, becoming more lean, challenging the playbooks we know and better preparing ourselves for our future state. While it's hard to see that in light of what I would characterize as a disappointing financial performance against our standards, I remain appropriately metered with optimism. Elements that support that view should and will be revealed in the following discussion from our leaders. Finally, as recently announced, this will be my last earnings call as Chief Executive Officer. It has been a tremendous honor to serve in this capacity for the last 13 years. Our Board of Directors has taken a very thoughtful approach to succession planning and has tremendous confidence in my successor and our entire leadership team. So now I'd like to turn the call over to our President and incoming Chief Executive, Ms. Shelley Simpson.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you, John and good afternoon. As John made pretty clear, the market continues to be challenging. We remain focused on what we can control and how we position our business to deliver exceptional value for our customers and shareholders over the long term. The challenge we face today as an organization is managing the business to best prepare us for future growth while balancing the need to manage and control costs in the near term. To be clear, the strategic opportunities we have across our business segments gives us great confidence in our future success. Last quarter, we introduced our priorities for 2024. Our focus as a management team and an organization is to execute on these priorities which, as a reminder, are: one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, scale our long-term investments in our company foundations which are people, technology and capacity; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. Markets are always hard to predict, even more so over the last several years given the wild swings we have seen on both the supply and demand side of the equation. One thing we know for sure, markets ultimately return to some balance after overcorrecting on one side or the other. We continue to view the market as out of balance and customers have been and are taking advantage. We've been surprised by the competitiveness in the bid season thus far. We can't predict when the current rate environment will change and as a result, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs. Importantly, though, we are doing this without sacrificing the long-term opportunities for our company to grow and generate greater returns for our shareholders. In fact, I would argue, we've only enhanced it during the first quarter with some of the investments we've made, most notably our purchase of the Walmart Intermodal container fleet. We are also adapting in how we approach our customers and contracts in terms of our commitments. We will always be long-term focused and strategic. That said, we will have to be thoughtful in how we work with our customers. Our management team and business leaders are intensely focused on our cost efforts while maintaining discipline on our long-term growth and return on capital thresholds. In closing, I remain confident in our strategy and approach to manage through this part of the cycle. We continue to make thoughtful and disciplined investments that will only enhance the future performance of our company. While the magnitude of this part of the cycle has certainly been more severe, both in terms of depth and duration, we strongly believe in our ability to outperform the market on service quality, value and growth. We have and will continue to prove our ability to deliver outperformance for our people, our customers and our shareholders. Our confidence is in our people, our experience our complementary businesses, our scale and our financial strength which uniquely positions us for our future. As we've said in the past, we remain committed to disciplined investments in our people, technology and capacity but we will continue to challenge ourselves on our costs. I am confident that we will be better positioned as a result, coming out of this part of the cycle, as we continue to pursue our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John?\nJohn Kuhlow: Thank you, Shelley and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter, provide some additional color on our costs and the impact on margins as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, we continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure. Our financial performance is not where we want it to be, particularly in Intermodal and our Highway Services. We recognize that some of this is driven by market dynamics, while some is related to our decision to remain committed to our investments to drive future growth. As Shelley alluded to, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs while trying to maintain the right balance of resources to support our future growth. I'll start with a high-level review of the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%, operating income declined 30% and diluted earnings per share decreased 35%. The declines were primarily driven by a combination of lower yields and freight volume combined with inflationary cost pressures. Our tax rate in the quarter was 28.7% versus 24.7% in the prior year. The increase was related to discrete items and other adjustments and we continue to expect our annual effective rate to be between 24% and 25%. As previously mentioned, in addition to the market dynamics, our commitment to our investments in our people, technology and capacity are putting additional pressure on our cost structure and, as a result, our margin performance. We have visibility to these costs and their impact on the performance of each business segment. On a consolidated basis, these costs aggregate to approximately $100 million related primarily to having too many resources with our people and capacity for our current business levels that we plan on scaling into overtime. That said, we remain committed to our cost initiatives and have identified additional areas of opportunity to address which should not impede our ability to support meaningful growth of our business. We are confident in our ability to scale and leverage our investments. But right now, our focus is on how we best control our costs in the near term without diminishing the long-term earnings potential we have built in the business. Switching gears to our capital plan, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged at or below our target of 1x debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. We did retire $250 million of our senior notes that matured in the quarter with availability under our credit facility. For net capital expenditures, we previously stated an expectation to spend between $800 million to $1 billion for 2024 and we have no change to that range despite some recent announcements to further expand our capacity in our Intermodal segment. And finally, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchases. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick.\nNick Hobbs: Thanks, John and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update of our area of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the first quarter, I'm pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results. Despite the challenging freight environment, demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well despite the feeling we are swimming against the current. We sold approximately 690 new trucks during the quarter, very strong start towards our annual gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 new trucks for the year. While our sales pipeline remains strong, as we said last quarter, we do have some visibility into fleet losses or downsizes throughout 2024. The strong start in sales gives us some confidence in backfilling these losses over the course of the year. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although our customers continue to feel pressure in their businesses. While moderating, we continue to see some fleet downsizing due to business activity but also some bankruptcies here recently. We continue to remain disciplined on the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return targets. I'm pleased with the activity and recent sales we've been able to close in our pipeline. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers in this environment and maintaining the business, knowing it will support our future growth. Going forward, we remain confident in our differentiated model that has proven its resiliency in this tough market and our ability to compound our growth over many years and further penetrate our large addressable market. Moving to Final Mile. We have made good progress improving our business from revenue, quality, strong service metrics and more stabilized profitability levels, all while continuing to create value for and on behalf of our customers. We continue to see the market evolve and customers want high-quality service on a national scale to meet their big and bulky final mile delivery needs. Our first quarter results did include a benefit of $3.1 million from a favorable settlement of a prior year claim. Overall, demand for big and bulky products remains mixed with soft demand in the furniture industry and stable demand in both appliances and exercise equipment. Overall, we are modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and we continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. Our focus in this business continues to be providing the highest service level with a strong focus on being safe and secure as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customers. We will remain disciplined with new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while staying focused on growing the business and improving profitability. Similar to last quarters, I'll close with some comments on safety. Aligning with our company foundation of taking care of our people but also the motoring public, we continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 85% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras to our trucks, with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. We have seen a meaningful reduction in on-road collisions per million miles in trucks that have cameras installed. Additionally, we have reduced DOT preventable accidents per million miles approximately 25% in the quarter as compared to the prior year period. As our focus on safety remains at the forefront of our operation, as the cost of claims continue to move up exponentially, we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk, where possible. This concludes my remarks. So I would like to now turn it over to Darren.\nDarren Field: Thank you, Nick and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, demand for our Intermodal Service was weaker than our expectations, while imports into the West Coast have improved and inventories per our customers are in a more balanced position. We have yet to see that translate into any meaningful pickup in demand for our valued service product. Volumes in the quarter were flat year-over-year and by month, we're down 2% in January, up 3% in February and down 1% in March. While we are seeing growth in business in some lanes, particularly outbound Southern California, we are seeing pressure from truck pricing in the East. We have been surprised by how much competition we are seeing in bids but are remaining disciplined with our valued service offering. In February, we announced, we entered into a multiyear intermodal service agreement with Walmart in an arrangement that includes the purchase of Walmart's intermodal assets. This will increase our available container capacity as we execute toward our stated target of 150,000 containers. While this capacity is not needed at the moment, we saw this as a unique opportunity to make an investment that we feel confident will be beneficial to the organization over time. After not having enough capacity to meet our customers' demand in 2021 and '22, we have consistently been growing our capacity to ensure we are out in front to meet our customers' growth needs while also providing a high-quality service product that is reliable. We are pleased with our rail provider service levels and their approach and commitment to growing Intermodal. We are in constant communication with the railroads on ways we can work together to drive growth. While we believe that weak truckload pricing due to overcapacity is influencing customer decision-making, we continue to see a large amount of freight that should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share from the highway. As we have previously discussed, we continue to work with our rail providers to launch new services based on feedback from our customers. Our announcements last year, launching Quantum with BNSF and our new Mexico service in collaboration with BNSF and Ferromex, are two examples. Both service products are performing well but we are still early and see opportunities to grow with both services moving forward. Finally, on costs. As we have said previously, we have the resources and capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are currently handling, to the tune of at least 20%. This has been a drag on our margin performance and more than anticipated given both the depth and duration of the current market dynamics. We continue to challenge ourselves on our costs while trying to balance the future needs of the business to support meaningful growth. In closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. We are pleased with current results and have the people, technology and capacity in place that will allow us to scale into these investments. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost-competitive and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks.\nBrad Hicks: Thank you, Darren and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS and similar to the past few quarters, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue declined 26% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by a 22% decrease in volume and a 5% reduction in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from BNSF Logistics which contributed a little over $70 million of revenue to our results in the quarter. As we expected, we've had some challenges with the integration of the business but are encouraged and remain optimistic about our opportunity to penetrate the small and medium-sized shippers through this channel. One additional challenge we faced in the quarter is the proliferation of strategic cargo theft that we have discussed previously which I'll touch on later in my comments. We continue to make progress on adjusting our resources to our current business levels while driving greater accountability in the business. As everyone is aware, spot rates have and continue to be under a lot of pressure. While some of the weather-driven tightness in January pressured gross margins, looser capacity in February and March helped recover, to some degree. Closing out on ICS, we aren't pleased with the current results but we continue to make adjustments to improve profitability while focusing on ways to enhance productivity to allow us to scale disproportionately to our costs when the market turns. Moving over to Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 13% year-over-year driven by a 9% decline in revenue per load and a 5% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360box service offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. That said, we would characterize demand for drop trailing capacity as soft as a reflection of our current trailer utilization and what we are seeing in bids. Similar to what you heard in Intermodal, we have greater resources and trailing capacity than what the current demand environment requires. We view our trailing capacity specifically as being greater than 20% underutilized. We have been encouraged by how well demand has held up for our drop trailer solutions, J.B. Hunt 360box but we have certainly seen pressure on rates. Thankfully, this model allows us to be more variable with our costs and we think ultimately will present opportunities for us to scale a cost-competitive solution for our customers while generating an appropriate return on our capital. I'll close with some comments on 360. Technology enables our people and helps drive productivity and also drive efficiency and how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. While technology is a foundational pillar for us, it has opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft given these organized groups' access to thousands of loads through our platform. To combat the increase in strategic theft, we are making some adjustments to harden the security of our system and have new initiatives that will deliver in the future to further enhance the security of our platform. As you have and are likely to notice, we are shifting some processes to be more manual in nature until these new security features are implemented. Long term, we continue to believe our technology investments will drive productivity and efficiency gains and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments, so I'll now turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A.\nBrad Delco: Lisa, in light of the time, could we have the analysts ask one question and one question only?\nOperator: Yes, absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to talk a little bit about the pricing market. You mentioned how it was a bit challenged on the Intermodal side. What percent of the book is already done now? And then what percent reprices in 2Q?\nDarren Field: Yes. So Jason, this is Darren. We've said before, we price about 30% in each of the first 3 quarters and about 10% in the fourth quarter. And so the pricing cycle that began in October of '23 is something less than half complete but around 40%.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: John, best of luck in your next steps. Shelley, congrats. So I just want to talk about, I guess, cost. If I think about the 20% excess capacity here, John, you mentioned kind of the $100 million target. Maybe talk about your thoughts on do you get rid of capacity at this point to work with the industry to shrink that. Maybe walk us through the process of getting that $100 million of cost out, if the down cycle is lasting longer.\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes. So Ken, as we kind of said in the opening remarks, we've been talking for a while now about our investments in our people and our equipment and we thought it would be helpful to provide some additional transparency on the impact of these investments and so we've quantified as best we can for that for you. We do have good insight into our productivity and utilization metrics and that's informed us of this cost measure. And so if we were focused on the short term, there could be a different play to call here. But we have a very long-term view on the company and our investments and we believe in our strategic decisions and around our valuable resources. So if there was a major economic environmental change, we may consider but right now, we're focused on growing into this capacity and holding on to our commitments to our people for the long term.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Darren, just thoughts on the volume trends, seeing a lot of international intermodal volume going inland and intact [ph] -- and clearly, a big disconnect with your volume and your primary rail partner in the West when you look at transcon versus their total volume. So I wanted to get your thought on that. Is that a precursor for more transloading, more domestic coming, imports that have been pretty strong now? Or do you think there's some sort of shift and this is going to be a bit of an overhang for a while and perhaps losing some share to the international track?\nDarren Field: Yes. So on, certainly, the West Coast, imported volume that we've seen has, to some degree, disconnected. But of course, a year ago, the comparison for imports was so poor that I don't think it was very difficult for those comparisons to look so strong. The other thing I just want to highlight, while our volumes were flat for the quarter for the entire network, our Southern California eastbound volume did grow in the quarter by double digits. And so we did experience some volume growth in segments of our business. Now obviously, that means we didn't grow and actually lost volume in other areas. I think in our earnings release, we talked about being negative 7% in the Eastern network. That's been a dogfight, with truckload capacity pricing being really, really competitive. And as we move further into the year, we continue to look for ways to drive cost out, present value to our customers and be prepared for growth in the future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Just on the intermodal pricing, to follow up here. I know you guys pointed to the truck market obviously being loose here. But is it just truck? Or are you also seeing price competition from some of your IMC peers? And also, are you confident that this is just a function of the cycle, where it is right now? Or do you feel like because of that excess capacity, it may be kind of a little more sustained even if volumes start to come back?\nDarren Field: We've said that we're probably out of the business of trying to predict the future because it's been really, really difficult for over 4 years now. Certainly, pricing in intermodal, whether it be from truckload capacity or other intermodal competitors, it has been competitive. And history would tell us that it is where we are in the cycle right now and that there will come a time when pricing and volume will return. I think that Shelly's prepared comments really highlighted that we're in a spot where it's out of balance and certainly, customers have taken advantage of that and the future really gives us an opportunity to seek both growth and pricing improvements.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: John and Shelley, congrats to you both on the announcement. Maybe to pivot for a moment to DCS, Nick, I wanted to ask you about the commentary from the prior call that it could be hard to grow Dedicated revenue and profitability this year. But when I look at the truck sales in the first quarter, they were pretty strong and it sounds like you're a bit more confident that you can backfill some of the attrition you see ahead. So when you put it all together, do you feel like Dedicated can hold relatively flat in 2024? And maybe you could just comment more broadly on the competitive environment in Dedicated as well.\nNick Hobbs: Sure. So we had a very good sales quarter, 690 trucks is a good quarter for us, so we're off to a good start. Our pipeline is looking good. From a competitive standpoint, I would say who we see that we're competing with is a lot of the private fleets, it's not a lot of our publicly traded companies and so we feel good in that competitive market. And so we feel good about where that's going. And I would say, if you just look at this quarter, we've had some losses from bankruptcies. We lost our tenth largest customer to that. And so with all that said, with our sales pipeline, we think we'll be able to hold flat as we've kind of given guidance that we did, I think, towards the year. So we feel good about that, of where we're at and the sales pipeline continues to be strong.\nBrad Delco: Justin, this is Brad. I mean, consistent with what Nick said, I think our direct comments last time were, say, in light of our visibility to some fleet losses, it would be difficult to grow. But I think most of the market has interpreted that as relatively flat. I don't know that we want to be on record providing guidance for that. But I would say the pluses or minuses, since we've previously stated that, I think clearly, the sales performance in DCS coming out of Q1 is a lot stronger than we anticipated. We talked last year about the pipeline being very strong and some bigger deals begin there, obviously, some of those landed. But I would also say that's the positive side. On the negative side and this was in Nick's comments, we have seen a pickup in some bankruptcies and so that's maybe a little bit of a negative that offset some of the positive on the new sales performance that we've seen to start the year. So, I just want to add that in.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Walmart contract. I think the way you talked about it in the prepared remarks was along the lines of adding containers. My understanding was that you were also adding new freight along with those containers. So I wonder if you could just give us a thought on kind of how well utilized were the containers that you're bringing on? And how should we think about the pace of that? Is that something that kind of ramps across a couple of quarters? And I would think that would be big enough to see in your volume numbers but just really wanted to see if you could give us a bit more perspective to understand that. And also, I'd be remiss if I didn't say something. Just congratulations, John. And Shelley, congratulations to you as well.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks, Thomas.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you.\nDarren Field: So on the Walmart agreement, it's a confidential agreement between us and Walmart, so I'm going to be pretty limited in what I would say there. Certainly, the opportunity to grow towards our 150,000 container target with capacity that existed in the market was a unique opportunity for us that has been in a dialogue for some time. Certainly, that didn't get created in the first quarter. That's certainly when it got announced and we're really encouraged by what it will mean for the long-term future value we can build from that program. There are mutual commitments, obviously, of capacity and volumes inside that agreement. Beyond that, I'm probably not going to be able to comment on the volume. What I would say from a timing perspective, I think we've shared that it will onboard to our fleet over the course of a year. That doesn't mean much of it will be in storage and will go potentially unutilized until we can grow into the capacity. What was the last question. I've drawn a blank here?\nBrad Delco: Tom, can you repeat the last part of your question?\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. I think just trying to figure out, is this something that we would see affect the volume numbers as it builds through the year? I think that's been our expectation, that you would be big enough to actually see it in the volume numbers but I wanted to see if you could offer a thought on that, too.\nDarren Field: Yes. I probably really can't comment on the volume related to it. Certainly, we're looking to grow with all of our customers.\nBrad Delco: Yes. And then while we're on this tough topic, I do want to link maybe, Tom, that question with an earlier question to John Kuhlow about how we're approaching capacity and our investments. As an example, you've seen us really temper down the pace at which we are adding containers. We recognize that the market wasn't developing or evolving as quickly. Obviously, we've mentioned that the depth and duration of this current part of the cycle has lasted longer than we anticipated. And I think some of that recognition was you seeing us pull back on the pace at which we are taking those deliveries of additional containers. And so, what I thought was a good attribute of this transaction which was opportunistic -- was we certainly have accelerated our pace at getting to 150,000 containers which we announced back in 2022 but without adding additional capacity to the industry. And so I think it's a good highlight here and I just wanted to reiterate that for the audience.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: So if you look back to 2017, in the big picture context, that was a challenging year for Intermodal. But if you compare that to the current trailing 4Q, volumes compounded at 0.5% or so, yield has driven high single-digit revenue growth and profit compounded for intermodal about 4% and that's after adding back the insurance cards last quarter. And I realize, just we all look at the numbers, a lot of this is due to the railroad-driven circumstances outside of Hunt's control. But if this backdrop of less structural growth and more cyclical volatility continues to be the norm into next year and beyond, how do you manage your operations and capital allocation priorities differently over the long term?\nDarren Field: Well, I'll jump in from an Intermodal perspective and then we may have others that want to comment. But going through 2021 and '22 when we really could not provide enough capacity for our customers, I think, really did teach us an important lesson, as well as commitments between us and our rail providers to grow with each other. I mean those are our genuine commitments. The announcement back in '22, jointly with BNSF to grow the fleet, was a joint commitment to expand capacity for the intermodal market and both companies are honoring that commitment and making sure that our customers are aware that we're there and ready to support them when they need to grow. Now clearly, if the magnitude of the cycles really inflects much greater, that can mean that the down cycle can be a little more painful and then it's hard to be out in front enough to cover the up cycle. And so we will certainly adapt as best we can. We'll continue to work with our customers to ask for better forecasts and how can we get better identification of the opportunity. But we know this, when we're there to support our customers' growth demand, it certainly bears fruit for our shareholders over the long term as those customers just gain more and more confidence in our ability to serve their needs.\nBrad Delco: I might just add, in terms of the capital allocation, John Kuhlow, you can add to this as well. Think about our different businesses, Dedicated is a success-based capital pull-down, if you will. So when we sell new Dedicated deals, it requires us to invest capital. And we will continue to do that because of the discipline and how each of those deals are underwritten to specified return targets. If you think about Intermodal, primarily most of those assets, at least on the trailing side or the containers, they're 20-plus-year assets. We obviously are way out in front of what investments are needed to support our growth there. And so then it's a matter of what's the right replacement cycle for a sector equipment, what's the right balance of what we're utilizing maybe the 360 platform for, insourcing third-party capacity whether it's in intermodal dray or other parts of our network. And then finally, where we would see capital is growing 360box in the trailing equipment. So I think there's a lot of flexibility in terms of how we deploy capital. And this is an example of a year, if we look in the first quarter EBITDA certainly down year-over-year but the debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis is actually down from where we were at the end of Q4 and our cash balance is up slightly. So we generated very strong cash flow in the first quarter. And so our capital priorities won't change: number one will be to invest in our business; number two, support our dividend; maintain investment-grade credit rating; and number four would be to opportunistically buy back stock. And every once in a while, we do see inorganic growth opportunities but that's not really at the core of who we are. And so that will kind of continue to be our discipline going forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Best of luck to you, John. Congrats, Shelley. I had a near term and then a bigger picture question. So just to help set near-term expectations, should we expect Intermodal rev per load and intermodal margin to improve sequentially from Q1 to Q2? And then just bigger picture, you guys just keep talking about the depth and duration of the cycle longer or worse than you thought. I guess, what's the catalyst for this to change? The overall economy is fine. It's not like we're in a recession and there's some demand recovery coming. So what actually, in your mind, is going to change? Is it possible, I guess? It feels terrible versus '21 and '22 but maybe those were just unprecedented years that we just need to ignore, I don't know.\nDarren Field: Scott, I'll quickly jump in on your first question around Q2 versus Q1. We're a non-guidance organization and we're trying hard not to be predictive. Certainly, history would tell us that volumes in Q2 on average are better than Q1. That doesn't mean I'm telling you that Q2 would be better but history would suggest that's been the case. And so beyond that, we don't have a visibility into pricing at this stage to make any prediction as to what would happen with that.\nShelley Simpson: Scott, I'll take the second part of the question. If you think about the last 4 years and I said this in my opening comments, the highs and lows have been more dramatic than any time period in my 30-year career. And so our ability to predict has been very difficult. We have seen periods of positives that then quickly fall off. And so I think you see a management team here knowing what our customers are asking us for in our future but being cautious about any positive signs that we could be seeing as we've seen some of those retreat several times over the last couple of years. If you think about what's happening in the market, there's an oversupply of capacity and that's not exiting quick enough. That's an important component for all of our businesses, across all 5 of our segments. I also think what's happening from our customers' feedback and what feedback they're giving us on confidence for us to be able to grow even in the middle of a freight recession, so how can we think about that differently. That's why we are so focused on delivering great service and more value for our customers and also, the confidence our customers build over time and our ability, J.B. Hunt and the railroads, to deliver really great service for a longer period of time. I think our customers, over the last several years, have struggled with gaining the right level of consistency and service from intermodal collectively, from the railroads and J.B Hunt and that's something that's going to take us time to win back their confidence. So I would say those are all the things that we're watching and talking to our customers about. I will say this and we also said this in our opening comments, that our customers are giving us good feedback. It has been a difficult, more competitive bid season than what we expected but we're managing through that, we're working with our customers and we're really trying to think about what's best long term for both them and us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs.\nBrad Delco: We're having some really bad static.\nJordan Alliger: Can you hear me now? Is that better?\nBrad Delco: Go ahead. It sounds better.\nJordan Alliger: Can you help me understand a little bit how the operating leverage is going to work in Intermodal? I think you mentioned about 20% over resourced. So when the cycle does turn up and we get that inflection in volume and price, how quickly can that get absorbed? How quickly do you think margins could get back to the targeted range you guys have talked about?\nDarren Field: Well, certainly, pricing is always the fastest cure for a margin challenge. That's going to contribute quicker than just raw volume. But volume today, with 20% excess capacity, has never been more valuable to our system in terms of the role it can play on expanding the margin. So it feels like how quickly can we grow into 20%, well, it's been certainly more than a decade since we grew 20% 1 year. We're still very confident in the overall market of truckload business where intermodal can and should be the right answer for. But I don't want to tell you that we're going to grow 20% in a year's time. I don't know that that's in the card. We'll have to wait and see. Our system is built for it and could accommodate it but that's not necessarily what we'll see. So from a timing perspective, to get back into the margin target, I mean, certainly, we need to see when does that inflection happen and what is the pace of sort of pricing opportunity, how fast is capacity exit, what's the sort of the sharpness in the curve of the demand environment. And if I gave you a prediction on that, I'm sure I would be wrong.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Darren, I just want to go back to maybe a couple of questions ago when you talked about volumes being typically better than 1Q. I mean are we seeing any evidence of that? Did you see any of it at the end of March? Are you seeing any of it in April? Because 4Q to 1Q, obviously, it's down typically 5% to 6% and you guys were down 9% to 10%. And so I'm just trying to understand if you're actually seeing it on the ground. And then obviously, Norfolk Southern, there's a lot going on at Norfolk. They announced that they're basically removing service on 15% of their intermodal lanes. Does that have an impact? And usually, you guys have weighed in on dynamics happening in the rail space. And obviously, there's a lot going on at Norfolk and would love to get your opinion on it given the strong partnership you have there out East.\nBrad Delco: Amit, I'll start, just first on your question about Q2 and forward guidance. I mean, we just, in the history, don't provide intra-quarter updates on volume and we're not going to do that here. So I'll turn it over to Darren if he wants to comment on the second part of your question but we'll be limited on what we'll say there, too.\nDarren Field: Well, the announcement by Norfolk Southern on the intermodal changes was almost completely international intermodal related, so it hasn't been an impact at J.B. Hunt in any way whatsoever. In terms of what's going on there, we're not involved in that and I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on that.\nBrad Delco: And then the final thing I'd make and again, just to sort of point, Amit, you did mention volumes down sequentially by around 9.5%. That certainly is worse than normal seasonality. I would point out, though, if you wanted to look at that same analysis, historically, we've seen Q3 and Q4 volumes relatively at parity and we saw and we talked about seeing a stronger peak season than what was expected and I think what was sort of experienced by the overall market. And so if you compare where our Q1 volumes came in relative to Q3, again, assuming that normally Q3 and Q4 are relatively flat, volumes were down 7% which is a little bit closer to normal seasonality.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Darren, I was going to ask you basically what Brad just talked about. The fourth quarter, you said a peak season that no one was expecting. Your volumes are better than typically in the third quarter. Pricing was even up sequentially, if we look at just revenue per load and then the first quarter, a pretty substantial step back. So I'm just trying to understand, what changed in that 6-month period? Why was 4Q better, 1Q worse? The trucking market seemed to stink all the way through. So is that front-end loading by customers? Was that something indicative of the economy of rail service? How can we had kind of like the green shoot period in 4Q and then another step back from 1Q?\nDarren Field: Jon, I think you're asking the same questions that we ask to our customers throughout both events. I mean, the fourth quarter uptick in demand for us was a surprise and our system was able to accommodate capacity to execute on it. Equally, coming out of the fourth quarter, we were surprised by the magnitude of the decline in the first quarter. And certainly, I don't have a great answer in terms of what the catalyst was, I think the mix of our particular customer base certainly drove the opportunity in the fourth quarter and it may certainly be returning. Kind of as Brad highlighted, maybe what we experienced in the first quarter was actually a little bit of a return back to normal off of a higher fourth quarter and we've got to wait and see where the year takes us at this point.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Congrats to John and Shelley as well. Can you guys talk to maybe ICS profitability? Because I think sequentially, it did worsen in the first quarter, just being disciplined around customers and focused on returning to profitability for the brokerage business.\nBrad Hicks: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. It's Brad Hicks. It's certainly been extremely competitive for several quarters now. As we think about the brokerage market, in particular the spot market and what we've seen there, we see a modest tick-up in January, only to see that kind of level back down to the trough that it's been really for probably the last 4-plus quarters in terms of what rate and quality of revenue has done. We're certainly focused on trying to grow where we can grow and grow with customers that we believe that we can create value for, such that that's stickier in the forward view. As I've mentioned in previous quarters, those that we supported at their time of greatest need have seemingly gone the way of finding the lowest-cost solution that they can possibly find and that certainly harmed our business, our volumes. But I do feel like our gross margin recovered throughout the quarter. We saw it hit severely during the winter storms in January which is abnormal for us. But we were able to recover and deliver a gross margin of a little over 14%, I think it was 14.3%, so we were encouraged by that and we're certainly focused on volume.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: So you mentioned in the press release the disciplined approach to the market for the value of services in the Intermodal segment. I'm just wondering if you can give us some expectations around kind of how you're approaching the market the rest of the year, anything you've learned out a bid season that would speak to kind of what the volume outlook might be for full year Intermodal growth, in the segment.\nDarren Field: Yes. So I think that the pricing that we issued early in the bid season, we had some surprises with the results and it was really competitive. And we were surprised by the magnitude of some of the truckload rates from truckload competitors out there and that's certainly has helped us to identify can we offer shorter-term programs to our customers as we move forward, are there opportunities with the rail providers to participate with us in a way that we can be more competitive. And we're seeking all of those opportunities one opportunity at a time, one customer at a time and we'll continue to do that and see where we land as we move throughout the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Kauffman: John, congratulations. And Shelley, big fan, congratulations as well to you. My one question is the following, you mentioned growing out the franchise, the focus on the longer term. I was a little surprised to see trailer count down so much sequentially from fourth quarter. Are we basically saying the trailer pool experiment is done and we're going back to something more normal? Or is there anything driving that, that would be something worth noting.\nShelley Simpson: So Jeff, I think you're talking about the end of period versus the average. Is that right?\nJeff Kauffman: Well, it's down about 1,700 units. So I was just kind of curious why it was down so much given the trailer pool growth that we've seen in that division for the last number of quarters.\nBrad Hicks: Yes. I'm showing what we reported in the period for Q1 for our Truckload segment at a little over 13,000 trailers which is just down 100 from same period in 2023.\nJeff Kauffman: Apologies, I was looking versus fourth quarter but I can come back to you off-line. I was just a little bit surprised.\nBrad Delco: Yes, Jeff, let's cover that off-line. I think we did have some trailers that were transferred over to DCS. So if you noticed, the DCS trailer count is higher and that's a lot related to some of the business that was transferred at the start of 2023. If you recall, we moved some business out of JBT into DCS and some of the ownership of that trailer stayed in JBT for the year. We transferred those over.\nBrad Hicks: Yes. And let me just add from my opening comments that we do have excess capacity and so we're making good company-wide decisions around where we can utilize those in the short term but in no way are we abandoning our 360box strategy. As I mentioned, we actually had volume growth inside of the network that, that box strategy supports and we remain very encouraged about that service offering.\nJeff Kauffman: That's the context I was looking for.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Great. There was some discussion on bad debt expense. It sounded like it was meaningful. I think you referred to like the tenth largest customer in Dedicated. And so I'm guessing that was maybe a meaningful effect on the margin in 1Q. Can you give us any quantification how big that was year-over-year or absolute, just if we could kind of think about potentially parsing that out or just understanding that impact?\nJohn Kuhlow: Yes. So Tom, this is John Kuhlow. So our bad debt expense on a consolidated basis quarter-over-quarter was $4.6 million. We had a reversal in the prior year first quarter of around $1 million and we charged $3.6 million in the first quarter of this year.\nBrad Delco: And Tom, most of that would have been in DCS.\nJohn Kuhlow: Primarily in Dedicated.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to Shelley Simpson for any additional or closing remarks.\nShelley Simpson: Thank you and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Here we are, going on two years of a really difficult freight market, the hardest freight market, I think, in my 30-year career and I think certainly for the entire leadership team. And it's hard to see what's really happening good when you see financial performance struggling as a result but we did have some really great things I want to make sure to call out for our people. Number one, our people continue to deliver great safety performance as we reduced accidents per million miles DOT preventable by 25% and that is something important and at the forefront of how we think of our operations. We also delivered for our customers on great on-time service and that's our expectation, that we continue to deliver value and that's where we're going to be focused. We talked a lot about what we can control. And although we're not pleased with our performance, we are focused on controlling our costs without jeopardizing our long-term opportunity. We're listening to our customers and they're counting on us. They want us to deliver the right value for them and we have to make sure that's the right value for us. We remain committed to being long term in our focus, to being disciplined in our investments and we want to stay balanced between the needs of our customers and delivering the greatest return for our shareholders. But I want to make sure that I end on this, we talk about being for our people. And if you think about where we're at as an organization, we've been led by 4 different leaders previous to me and John Roberts has had the privilege of leading our company for the last 13 years. John is one that won't normally turn the spotlight back on him. So since I'm sitting in the seat now, I get an opportunity to do that. In our 13 years, John, actually entered the organization in that time period into the Fortune 500. We've seen our company grow substantially over the course of period and we've also seen our shareholders benefit greatly. As I step into these shoes, they are big shoes to fill but I will tell you we have great leaders that not only sit at the table with me but all throughout our organization. Our tenure in the company is something that's remarkable and something that I think has been tried and true to what makes a culture successful. But I would be remiss if we weren't to say one of our greatest advocates for our people is are still CEO John Roberts. And I want to make sure I give him an opportunity to address based on being our CEO and spending time doing that. And I just want to say thanks on behalf of, John, not only our leadership team but for the 35,000 people that have stood with you for the last 13 years, thanks for everything you've done. And I'll turn the call over to you.\nJohn Roberts: Well, I appreciate that, Shelley. You know I don't like a lot of attention. I'll tell you that it's been the greatest honor of my professional career to get to be a part of and lead this team through some incredible growth years, through some learning years, through some evolution. Even with this quarter and even the last few and as you mentioned in the last couple of years, I could not be more proud of this group of people, all 35,000 of them, for everything that has happened under the banner of our scroll. And the way that we always put our people and our customers first knowing that we have a duty to return compounding growth and reliable, credible information so that our shareholders, our owners can make good decisions, I think that that's something we want to protect and we want to be candid and transparent. I can say with no hesitation at all and I've been up here the last couple of weeks hanging around and kind of watching for the things that I look for when I want to see my team win the Masters, win the Super Bowl, win the NCAA tournament, I see it all. I've seen it really for the last couple of years. But right now, the fire is hot and our people are responding to that. Our leadership is guiding the way they're supposed to go. Our priorities are right. And I get to hand this institution, this brand, to a very, very capable person in Shelley. And importantly, she and I both agree, neither one of us can do anything without our team and specifically our leadership team. We have the highest level of responsibility to be sure that we get it right and when we don't get it right, get it right, redirect, evolve, make sure we keep our focus on the right things. It's an honor. I am humbled. I'm amazed. I am thrilled. I am sad. I am all of the above. The best news is that I still have a seat at this table. I look forward to being the Chairman of this company and working in a different capacity. But I hope to continue to leverage my 35 years of experience. And 25, 13 of which was at Ford's running dedicated contract services where I learned so many things; and the last 13-plus of being our CEO, just thank you for your trust. I feel like we've had a great relationship with you folks and it's been a lot of fun. It's been a lot more fun than it hasn't, it's just not a lot of fun right now; so we got to go to work. So, thanks for calling in, and we'll be back with you next quarter with Shelley at the helm.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brad Hicks",
            "content": "Thank you, Darren and good afternoon, everyone. I'll review the performance of our Integrated Capacity Solutions and Truckload segments. I will also provide an update on some of our work in J.B. Hunt 360. Starting with ICS and similar to the past few quarters, the overall brokerage environment remains competitive from both a volume and rate perspective. Segment gross revenue declined 26% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by a 22% decrease in volume and a 5% reduction in revenue per load. These figures include the contribution from BNSF Logistics which contributed a little over $70 million of revenue to our results in the quarter. As we expected, we've had some challenges with the integration of the business but are encouraged and remain optimistic about our opportunity to penetrate the small and medium-sized shippers through this channel. One additional challenge we faced in the quarter is the proliferation of strategic cargo theft that we have discussed previously which I'll touch on later in my comments. We continue to make progress on adjusting our resources to our current business levels while driving greater accountability in the business. As everyone is aware, spot rates have and continue to be under a lot of pressure. While some of the weather-driven tightness in January pressured gross margins, looser capacity in February and March helped recover, to some degree. Closing out on ICS, we aren't pleased with the current results but we continue to make adjustments to improve profitability while focusing on ways to enhance productivity to allow us to scale disproportionately to our costs when the market turns. Moving over to Truckload. Segment gross revenue was down 13% year-over-year driven by a 9% decline in revenue per load and a 5% decrease in volumes. Overall, demand for our J.B. Hunt 360box service offering is outperforming the overall market as volumes in the quarter were up once again versus the prior year. That said, we would characterize demand for drop trailing capacity as soft as a reflection of our current trailer utilization and what we are seeing in bids. Similar to what you heard in Intermodal, we have greater resources and trailing capacity than what the current demand environment requires. We view our trailing capacity specifically as being greater than 20% underutilized. We have been encouraged by how well demand has held up for our drop trailer solutions, J.B. Hunt 360box but we have certainly seen pressure on rates. Thankfully, this model allows us to be more variable with our costs and we think ultimately will present opportunities for us to scale a cost-competitive solution for our customers while generating an appropriate return on our capital. I'll close with some comments on 360. Technology enables our people and helps drive productivity and also drive efficiency and how we source and serve customers with our available capacity. While technology is a foundational pillar for us, it has opened new avenues for bad actors to engage in sophisticated strategic theft given these organized groups' access to thousands of loads through our platform. To combat the increase in strategic theft, we are making some adjustments to harden the security of our system and have new initiatives that will deliver in the future to further enhance the security of our platform. As you have and are likely to notice, we are shifting some processes to be more manual in nature until these new security features are implemented. Long term, we continue to believe our technology investments will drive productivity and efficiency gains and remain confident that these investments better position us for long-term growth with our customers and allow us to create greater value for our stakeholders. That concludes my comments, so I'll now turn it over to Brad Delco to provide instructions before the operator opens the call for Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. It's Brad Hicks. It's certainly been extremely competitive for several quarters now. As we think about the brokerage market, in particular the spot market and what we've seen there, we see a modest tick-up in January, only to see that kind of level back down to the trough that it's been really for probably the last 4-plus quarters in terms of what rate and quality of revenue has done. We're certainly focused on trying to grow where we can grow and grow with customers that we believe that we can create value for, such that that's stickier in the forward view.

But I do feel like our gross margin recovered throughout the quarter. We saw it hit severely during the winter storms in January which is abnormal for us. But we were able to recover and deliver a gross margin of a little over 14%, I think it was 14.3%, so we were encouraged by that and we're certainly focused on volume. Yes. I'm showing what we reported in the period for Q1 for our Truckload segment at a little over 13,000 trailers which is just down 100 from same period in 2023. Yes. And let me just add from my opening comments that we do have excess capacity and so we're making good company-wide decisions around where we can utilize those in the short term but in no way are we abandoning our 360box strategy. As I mentioned, we actually had volume growth inside of the network that, that box strategy supports and we remain very encouraged about that service offering."

            "name": "John Kuhlow",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelley and good afternoon, everyone. My comments will cover a high-level review of the quarter, provide some additional color on our costs and the impact on margins as well as provide an update on our capital plan for 2024. As a general overview, we continue to face inflationary cost pressures despite also facing deflationary pricing pressure. Our financial performance is not where we want it to be, particularly in Intermodal and our Highway Services. We recognize that some of this is driven by market dynamics, while some is related to our decision to remain committed to our investments to drive future growth. As Shelley alluded to, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs while trying to maintain the right balance of resources to support our future growth. I'll start with a high-level review of the first quarter. On a consolidated GAAP basis compared to last year, revenue declined 9%, operating income declined 30% and diluted earnings per share decreased 35%. The declines were primarily driven by a combination of lower yields and freight volume combined with inflationary cost pressures. Our tax rate in the quarter was 28.7% versus 24.7% in the prior year. The increase was related to discrete items and other adjustments and we continue to expect our annual effective rate to be between 24% and 25%. As previously mentioned, in addition to the market dynamics, our commitment to our investments in our people, technology and capacity are putting additional pressure on our cost structure and, as a result, our margin performance. We have visibility to these costs and their impact on the performance of each business segment. On a consolidated basis, these costs aggregate to approximately $100 million related primarily to having too many resources with our people and capacity for our current business levels that we plan on scaling into overtime. That said, we remain committed to our cost initiatives and have identified additional areas of opportunity to address which should not impede our ability to support meaningful growth of our business. We are confident in our ability to scale and leverage our investments. But right now, our focus is on how we best control our costs in the near term without diminishing the long-term earnings potential we have built in the business. Switching gears to our capital plan, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to provide us with ample liquidity to deploy capital as needed to drive long-term value for our shareholders. We have navigated this challenging freight environment while remaining conservatively leveraged at or below our target of 1x debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA. We did retire $250 million of our senior notes that matured in the quarter with availability under our credit facility. For net capital expenditures, we previously stated an expectation to spend between $800 million to $1 billion for 2024 and we have no change to that range despite some recent announcements to further expand our capacity in our Intermodal segment. And finally, we will remain opportunistic with share repurchases. This concludes my remarks and I'll now turn it over to Nick. Yes. So Ken, as we kind of said in the opening remarks, we've been talking for a while now about our investments in our people and our equipment and we thought it would be helpful to provide some additional transparency on the impact of these investments and so we've quantified as best we can for that for you. We do have good insight into our productivity and utilization metrics and that's informed us of this cost measure. And so if we were focused on the short term, there could be a different play to call here. But we have a very long-term view on the company and our investments and we believe in our strategic decisions and around our valuable resources. So if there was a major economic environmental change, we may consider but right now, we're focused on growing into this capacity and holding on to our commitments to our people for the long term. Yes. So Tom, this is John Kuhlow. So our bad debt expense on a consolidated basis quarter-over-quarter was $4.6 million. We had a reversal in the prior year first quarter of around $1 million and we charged $3.6 million in the first quarter of this year. Primarily in Dedicated."

            "content": "Thanks, John and good afternoon. I'll provide an update on our Dedicated and Final Mile businesses and give an update of our area of focus across our operations. I'll start with Dedicated. During the first quarter, I'm pleased with the strength and resiliency of our results. Despite the challenging freight environment, demand for professional outsourced private fleet solutions has held up well despite the feeling we are swimming against the current. We sold approximately 690 new trucks during the quarter, very strong start towards our annual gross sales target of 1,000 to 1,200 new trucks for the year. While our sales pipeline remains strong, as we said last quarter, we do have some visibility into fleet losses or downsizes throughout 2024. The strong start in sales gives us some confidence in backfilling these losses over the course of the year. We are seeing some signs of stabilization in terms of our fleet sizes across our accounts, although our customers continue to feel pressure in their businesses. While moderating, we continue to see some fleet downsizing due to business activity but also some bankruptcies here recently. We continue to remain disciplined on the types of deals we underwrite without sacrificing our return targets. I'm pleased with the activity and recent sales we've been able to close in our pipeline. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers in this environment and maintaining the business, knowing it will support our future growth. Going forward, we remain confident in our differentiated model that has proven its resiliency in this tough market and our ability to compound our growth over many years and further penetrate our large addressable market. Moving to Final Mile. We have made good progress improving our business from revenue, quality, strong service metrics and more stabilized profitability levels, all while continuing to create value for and on behalf of our customers. We continue to see the market evolve and customers want high-quality service on a national scale to meet their big and bulky final mile delivery needs. Our first quarter results did include a benefit of $3.1 million from a favorable settlement of a prior year claim. Overall, demand for big and bulky products remains mixed with soft demand in the furniture industry and stable demand in both appliances and exercise equipment. Overall, we are modestly encouraged by our sales pipeline and we continue to see new brands engage in discussions with our team. Our focus in this business continues to be providing the highest service level with a strong focus on being safe and secure as we deliver products into the homes of our customers' customers. We will remain disciplined with new business to ensure appropriate returns for our service while staying focused on growing the business and improving profitability. Similar to last quarters, I'll close with some comments on safety. Aligning with our company foundation of taking care of our people but also the motoring public, we continue to invest in employee training and new equipment and technologies to enhance our safety performance. We are over 85% complete with rolling out inward-facing cameras to our trucks, with the goal of being 100% complete by the end of the third quarter. We have seen a meaningful reduction in on-road collisions per million miles in trucks that have cameras installed. Additionally, we have reduced DOT preventable accidents per million miles approximately 25% in the quarter as compared to the prior year period. As our focus on safety remains at the forefront of our operation, as the cost of claims continue to move up exponentially, we continue our efforts to find new innovative ways to enhance our safety performance and further mitigate risk, where possible. This concludes my remarks. So I would like to now turn it over to Darren. Sure. So we had a very good sales quarter, 690 trucks is a good quarter for us, so we're off to a good start. Our pipeline is looking good. From a competitive standpoint, I would say who we see that we're competing with is a lot of the private fleets, it's not a lot of our publicly traded companies and so we feel good in that competitive market. And so we feel good about where that's going. And I would say, if you just look at this quarter, we've had some losses from bankruptcies. We lost our tenth largest customer to that. And so with all that said, with our sales pipeline, we think we'll be able to hold flat as we've kind of given guidance that we did, I think, towards the year. So we feel good about that, of where we're at and the sales pipeline continues to be strong."

            "content": "Thank you, John and good afternoon. As John made pretty clear, the market continues to be challenging. We remain focused on what we can control and how we position our business to deliver exceptional value for our customers and shareholders over the long term. The challenge we face today as an organization is managing the business to best prepare us for future growth while balancing the need to manage and control costs in the near term. To be clear, the strategic opportunities we have across our business segments gives us great confidence in our future success. Last quarter, we introduced our priorities for 2024. Our focus as a management team and an organization is to execute on these priorities which, as a reminder, are: one, to deliver exceptional value to our customers through operational excellence; two, scale our long-term investments in our company foundations which are people, technology and capacity; and three, drive long-term compounding returns for our shareholders. Markets are always hard to predict, even more so over the last several years given the wild swings we have seen on both the supply and demand side of the equation. One thing we know for sure, markets ultimately return to some balance after overcorrecting on one side or the other. We continue to view the market as out of balance and customers have been and are taking advantage. We've been surprised by the competitiveness in the bid season thus far. We can't predict when the current rate environment will change and as a result, we remain committed to our efforts to control our costs. Importantly, though, we are doing this without sacrificing the long-term opportunities for our company to grow and generate greater returns for our shareholders. In fact, I would argue, we've only enhanced it during the first quarter with some of the investments we've made, most notably our purchase of the Walmart Intermodal container fleet. We are also adapting in how we approach our customers and contracts in terms of our commitments. We will always be long-term focused and strategic. That said, we will have to be thoughtful in how we work with our customers. Our management team and business leaders are intensely focused on our cost efforts while maintaining discipline on our long-term growth and return on capital thresholds. In closing, I remain confident in our strategy and approach to manage through this part of the cycle. We continue to make thoughtful and disciplined investments that will only enhance the future performance of our company. While the magnitude of this part of the cycle has certainly been more severe, both in terms of depth and duration, we strongly believe in our ability to outperform the market on service quality, value and growth. We have and will continue to prove our ability to deliver outperformance for our people, our customers and our shareholders. Our confidence is in our people, our experience our complementary businesses, our scale and our financial strength which uniquely positions us for our future. As we've said in the past, we remain committed to disciplined investments in our people, technology and capacity but we will continue to challenge ourselves on our costs. I am confident that we will be better positioned as a result, coming out of this part of the cycle, as we continue to pursue our vision to create the most efficient transportation network in North America. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, John Kuhlow. John? Thank you. Scott, I'll take the second part of the question. If you think about the last 4 years and I said this in my opening comments, the highs and lows have been more dramatic than any time period in my 30-year career. And so our ability to predict has been very difficult. We have seen periods of positives that then quickly fall off. And so I think you see a management team here knowing what our customers are asking us for in our future but being cautious about any positive signs that we could be seeing as we've seen some of those retreat several times over the last couple of years. If you think about what's happening in the market, there's an oversupply of capacity and that's not exiting quick enough. That's an important component for all of our businesses, across all 5 of our segments. I also think what's happening from our customers' feedback and what feedback they're giving us on confidence for us to be able to grow even in the middle of a freight recession, so how can we think about that differently. That's why we are so focused on delivering great service and more value for our customers and also, the confidence our customers build over time and our ability, J.B. Hunt and the railroads, to deliver really great service for a longer period of time. I think our customers, over the last several years, have struggled with gaining the right level of consistency and service from intermodal collectively, from the railroads and J.B Hunt and that's something that's going to take us time to win back their confidence. So I would say those are all the things that we're watching and talking to our customers about. I will say this and we also said this in our opening comments, that our customers are giving us good feedback. It has been a difficult, more competitive bid season than what we expected but we're managing through that, we're working with our customers and we're really trying to think about what's best long term for both them and us. So Jeff, I think you're talking about the end of period versus the average. Is that right? Thank you and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Here we are, going on two years of a really difficult freight market, the hardest freight market, I think, in my 30-year career and I think certainly for the entire leadership team. And it's hard to see what's really happening good when you see financial performance struggling as a result but we did have some really great things I want to make sure to call out for our people. Number one, our people continue to deliver great safety performance as we reduced accidents per million miles DOT preventable by 25% and that is something important and at the forefront of how we think of our operations. We also delivered for our customers on great on-time service and that's our expectation, that we continue to deliver value and that's where we're going to be focused. We talked a lot about what we can control. And although we're not pleased with our performance, we are focused on controlling our costs without jeopardizing our long-term opportunity. We're listening to our customers and they're counting on us. They want us to deliver the right value for them and we have to make sure that's the right value for us. We remain committed to being long term in our focus, to being disciplined in our investments and we want to stay balanced between the needs of our customers and delivering the greatest return for our shareholders. But I want to make sure that I end on this, we talk about being for our people. And if you think about where we're at as an organization, we've been led by 4 different leaders previous to me and John Roberts has had the privilege of leading our company for the last 13 years. John is one that won't normally turn the spotlight back on him. So since I'm sitting in the seat now, I get an opportunity to do that. In our 13 years, John, actually entered the organization in that time period into the Fortune 500. We've seen our company grow substantially over the course of period and we've also seen our shareholders benefit greatly. As I step into these shoes, they are big shoes to fill but I will tell you we have great leaders that not only sit at the table with me but all throughout our organization. Our tenure in the company is something that's remarkable and something that I think has been tried and true to what makes a culture successful. But I would be remiss if we weren't to say one of our greatest advocates for our people is are still CEO John Roberts. And I want to make sure I give him an opportunity to address based on being our CEO and spending time doing that. And I just want to say thanks on behalf of, John, not only our leadership team but for the 35,000 people that have stood with you for the last 13 years, thanks for everything you've done. And I'll turn the call over to you."

            "name": "Darren Field",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick and thank you to everyone for joining us this afternoon on the call. I'll review the performance of the Intermodal business during the quarter, give an update on the market and service performance and highlight the continued opportunity we have to deliver value for our customers and all of our stakeholders. I'll start with Intermodal's performance. Overall, demand for our Intermodal Service was weaker than our expectations, while imports into the West Coast have improved and inventories per our customers are in a more balanced position. We have yet to see that translate into any meaningful pickup in demand for our valued service product. Volumes in the quarter were flat year-over-year and by month, we're down 2% in January, up 3% in February and down 1% in March. While we are seeing growth in business in some lanes, particularly outbound Southern California, we are seeing pressure from truck pricing in the East. We have been surprised by how much competition we are seeing in bids but are remaining disciplined with our valued service offering. In February, we announced, we entered into a multiyear intermodal service agreement with Walmart in an arrangement that includes the purchase of Walmart's intermodal assets. This will increase our available container capacity as we execute toward our stated target of 150,000 containers. While this capacity is not needed at the moment, we saw this as a unique opportunity to make an investment that we feel confident will be beneficial to the organization over time. After not having enough capacity to meet our customers' demand in 2021 and '22, we have consistently been growing our capacity to ensure we are out in front to meet our customers' growth needs while also providing a high-quality service product that is reliable. We are pleased with our rail provider service levels and their approach and commitment to growing Intermodal. We are in constant communication with the railroads on ways we can work together to drive growth. While we believe that weak truckload pricing due to overcapacity is influencing customer decision-making, we continue to see a large amount of freight that should be converted from over-the-road to Intermodal and we have the capacity and people in place to grow with our customers and recapture share from the highway. As we have previously discussed, we continue to work with our rail providers to launch new services based on feedback from our customers. Our announcements last year, launching Quantum with BNSF and our new Mexico service in collaboration with BNSF and Ferromex, are two examples. Both service products are performing well but we are still early and see opportunities to grow with both services moving forward. Finally, on costs. As we have said previously, we have the resources and capacity to handle significantly more volume than what we are currently handling, to the tune of at least 20%. This has been a drag on our margin performance and more than anticipated given both the depth and duration of the current market dynamics. We continue to challenge ourselves on our costs while trying to balance the future needs of the business to support meaningful growth. In closing, we continue to strongly believe in the strength of our Intermodal franchise. Our customers trust us and we continue to find new and innovative ways to better serve their transportation needs. We are pleased with current results and have the people, technology and capacity in place that will allow us to scale into these investments. We remain excited to work with our customers to meet their growing demand with an efficient cost-competitive and more environmentally friendly solution. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn it over to Brad Hicks. Yes. So Jason, this is Darren. We've said before, we price about 30% in each of the first 3 quarters and about 10% in the fourth quarter. And so the pricing cycle that began in October of '23 is something less than half complete but around 40%. Yes. So on, certainly, the West Coast, imported volume that we've seen has, to some degree, disconnected. But of course, a year ago, the comparison for imports was so poor that I don't think it was very difficult for those comparisons to look so strong. The other thing I just want to highlight, while our volumes were flat for the quarter for the entire network, our Southern California eastbound volume did grow in the quarter by double digits. And so we did experience some volume growth in segments of our business. Now obviously, that means we didn't grow and actually lost volume in other areas. I think in our earnings release, we talked about being negative 7% in the Eastern network. That's been a dogfight, with truckload capacity pricing being really, really competitive. And as we move further into the year, we continue to look for ways to drive cost out, present value to our customers and be prepared for growth in the future. We've said that we're probably out of the business of trying to predict the future because it's been really, really difficult for over 4 years now. Certainly, pricing in intermodal, whether it be from truckload capacity or other intermodal competitors, it has been competitive. And history would tell us that it is where we are in the cycle right now and that there will come a time when pricing and volume will return. I think that Shelly's prepared comments really highlighted that we're in a spot where it's out of balance and certainly, customers have taken advantage of that and the future really gives us an opportunity to seek both growth and pricing improvements. So on the Walmart agreement, it's a confidential agreement between us and Walmart, so I'm going to be pretty limited in what I would say there. Certainly, the opportunity to grow towards our 150,000 container target with capacity that existed in the market was a unique opportunity for us that has been in a dialogue for some time. Certainly, that didn't get created in the first quarter. That's certainly when it got announced and we're really encouraged by what it will mean for the long-term future value we can build from that program. There are mutual commitments, obviously, of capacity and volumes inside that agreement. Beyond that, I'm probably not going to be able to comment on the volume. What I would say from a timing perspective, I think we've shared that it will onboard to our fleet over the course of a year. That doesn't mean much of it will be in storage and will go potentially unutilized until we can grow into the capacity. What was the last question. I've drawn a blank here? Yes. I probably really can't comment on the volume related to it. Certainly, we're looking to grow with all of our customers. Well, I'll jump in from an Intermodal perspective and then we may have others that want to comment. But going through 2021 and '22 when we really could not provide enough capacity for our customers, I think, really did teach us an important lesson, as well as commitments between us and our rail providers to grow with each other. I mean those are our genuine commitments. The announcement back in '22, jointly with BNSF to grow the fleet, was a joint commitment to expand capacity for the intermodal market and both companies are honoring that commitment and making sure that our customers are aware that we're there and ready to support them when they need to grow. Now clearly, if the magnitude of the cycles really inflects much greater, that can mean that the down cycle can be a little more painful and then it's hard to be out in front enough to cover the up cycle. And so we will certainly adapt as best we can. We'll continue to work with our customers to ask for better forecasts and how can we get better identification of the opportunity. But we know this, when we're there to support our customers' growth demand, it certainly bears fruit for our shareholders over the long term as those customers just gain more and more confidence in our ability to serve their needs. Scott, I'll quickly jump in on your first question around Q2 versus Q1. We're a non-guidance organization and we're trying hard not to be predictive. Certainly, history would tell us that volumes in Q2 on average are better than Q1. That doesn't mean I'm telling you that Q2 would be better but history would suggest that's been the case. And so beyond that, we don't have a visibility into pricing at this stage to make any prediction as to what would happen with that. Well, certainly, pricing is always the fastest cure for a margin challenge. That's going to contribute quicker than just raw volume. But volume today, with 20% excess capacity, has never been more valuable to our system in terms of the role it can play on expanding the margin. So it feels like how quickly can we grow into 20%, well, it's been certainly more than a decade since we grew 20% 1 year. We're still very confident in the overall market of truckload business where intermodal can and should be the right answer for. But I don't want to tell you that we're going to grow 20% in a year's time. I don't know that that's in the card. We'll have to wait and see. Our system is built for it and could accommodate it but that's not necessarily what we'll see. So from a timing perspective, to get back into the margin target, I mean, certainly, we need to see when does that inflection happen and what is the pace of sort of pricing opportunity, how fast is capacity exit, what's the sort of the sharpness in the curve of the demand environment. And if I gave you a prediction on that, I'm sure I would be wrong. Well, the announcement by Norfolk Southern on the intermodal changes was almost completely international intermodal related, so it hasn't been an impact at J.B. Hunt in any way whatsoever. In terms of what's going on there, we're not involved in that and I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on that. Jon, I think you're asking the same questions that we ask to our customers throughout both events. I mean, the fourth quarter uptick in demand for us was a surprise and our system was able to accommodate capacity to execute on it. Equally, coming out of the fourth quarter, we were surprised by the magnitude of the decline in the first quarter. And certainly, I don't have a great answer in terms of what the catalyst was, I think the mix of our particular customer base certainly drove the opportunity in the fourth quarter and it may certainly be returning. Kind of as Brad highlighted, maybe what we experienced in the first quarter was actually a little bit of a return back to normal off of a higher fourth quarter and we've got to wait and see where the year takes us at this point. Yes. So I think that the pricing that we issued early in the bid season, we had some surprises with the results and it was really competitive. And we were surprised by the magnitude of some of the truckload rates from truckload competitors out there and that's certainly has helped us to identify can we offer shorter-term programs to our customers as we move forward, are there opportunities with the rail providers to participate with us in a way that we can be more competitive. And we're seeking all of those opportunities one opportunity at a time, one customer at a time and we'll continue to do that and see where we land as we move throughout the year."

            "name": "John Roberts",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good afternoon. I will be brief with my comments but I want to hit on a few topics before I turn it over to our team to give you their updates and to address your questions. Last quarter, we said goodbye and good riddance to 2023 and welcomed the new year with some reservations and concerns but nonetheless confident in the strength of our organization and the journey we are on to build an even bigger and better company. Over the last several years, you have heard us talk about how we manage the business for the long term, remain focused on being financially disciplined and being for our people who have the knowledge and talent to help us execute for and on behalf of our customers. From that perspective, nothing has changed and we remain committed to staying the course. Over that same time, we have faced challenges, have taken some calculated risks and made some strategic decisions that I remain confident will positively impact our company and our future growth. To be fair and somewhat critical, the current environment we're in has remained persistently challenging and for longer than we had predicted. But what I remain confident in is the strategic decisions and the direction and course we are on is well charted. Our conservative nature, financial discipline and coming from a position of strength has afforded us the opportunity to invest throughout this period to better prepare us for the eventual turn. We stand ready. Our company and our teams are working hard. To use a sports analogy, we are putting in the work, exercising the muscles, becoming more lean, challenging the playbooks we know and better preparing ourselves for our future state. While it's hard to see that in light of what I would characterize as a disappointing financial performance against our standards, I remain appropriately metered with optimism. Elements that support that view should and will be revealed in the following discussion from our leaders. Finally, as recently announced, this will be my last earnings call as Chief Executive Officer. It has been a tremendous honor to serve in this capacity for the last 13 years. Our Board of Directors has taken a very thoughtful approach to succession planning and has tremendous confidence in my successor and our entire leadership team. So now I'd like to turn the call over to our President and incoming Chief Executive, Ms. Shelley Simpson. Thanks, Thomas. Well, I appreciate that, Shelley. You know I don't like a lot of attention. I'll tell you that it's been the greatest honor of my professional career to get to be a part of and lead this team through some incredible growth years, through some learning years, through some evolution. Even with this quarter and even the last few and as you mentioned in the last couple of years, I could not be more proud of this group of people, all 35,000 of them, for everything that has happened under the banner of our scroll. And the way that we always put our people and our customers first knowing that we have a duty to return compounding growth and reliable, credible information so that our shareholders, our owners can make good decisions, I think that that's something we want to protect and we want to be candid and transparent. I can say with no hesitation at all and I've been up here the last couple of weeks hanging around and kind of watching for the things that I look for when I want to see my team win the Masters, win the Super Bowl, win the NCAA tournament, I see it all. I've seen it really for the last couple of years. But right now, the fire is hot and our people are responding to that. Our leadership is guiding the way they're supposed to go. Our priorities are right. And I get to hand this institution, this brand, to a very, very capable person in Shelley. And importantly, she and I both agree, neither one of us can do anything without our team and specifically our leadership team. We have the highest level of responsibility to be sure that we get it right and when we don't get it right, get it right, redirect, evolve, make sure we keep our focus on the right things. It's an honor. I am humbled. I'm amazed. I am thrilled. I am sad. I am all of the above. The best news is that I still have a seat at this table. I look forward to being the Chairman of this company and working in a different capacity. But I hope to continue to leverage my 35 years of experience. And 25, 13 of which was at Ford's running dedicated contract services where I learned so many things; and the last 13-plus of being our CEO, just thank you for your trust. I feel like we've had a great relationship with you folks and it's been a lot of fun. It's been a lot more fun than it hasn't, it's just not a lot of fun right now; so we got to go to work. So, thanks for calling in, and we'll be back with you next quarter with Shelley at the helm."
