We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones.\nAlexis Jones: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's full-year 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded in after-tax special item benefit of $3.2 billion or $8.91 per share for sale of Cigna's Group Disability and Life business that was completed on December 31, 2020. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $148 million or $00.41 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Beginning next quarter, in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, the Group Disability and Other segment will be combined with Corporate and called, Corporate and Other Operation. This change to simplify our reporting was enabled by the aforementioned sale of the Group Disability and Life business. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of any future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you, Alexis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year of transition, as communities and businesses seek to turn the page. I am very proud of the ways in which our 70,000-plus colleagues led, and continue to lead through this difficult time for customers, our clients, our providers, our partners, and our communities. Starting last spring, we were amongst the first to waive out-of-pocket costs COVID-19 testing as well as treatment. Our Evernorth business quickly leveraged our supply chain expertise to ensure a consistent prescription drug supply and delivery during the uncertain times. In our U.S. Medical Business, we ramped up to meet the significant increased demand for behavioral health services by growing our network, adding virtual provider partners, creating demand webcasts, treating first responders, and adding search capabilities for provider ethnicity. All over, we were deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to support our clients and partners who were hit hardest by the pandemic. In partnership with New York Life, we launched the Brave of Heart Fund to provide charitable grants for families, frontline workers, and volunteers who lost loved ones to COVID-19. And last month, our Cigna Medical Group was amongst the first non-hospital organizations in the nation to administer antibody therapy for high-risk COVID-19 patients, freeing up much needed hospital space. And just a few weeks ago, we partnered with industry leaders from across the public and private sectors to ensure that people who received the vaccine had digital access to the vaccination records so they can safely return to their jobs and daily activities. As we continue to work to serve our clients, our customers, and our patients during the pandemic, we also balanced our responsibility to deliver for shareholders as well. For 2020 full-year, we grew our adjusted revenue by 14%, to $160 billion. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $18.45, consistent with our overall expectations, which included the ongoing elevated cost of COVID-19-related services. Today, I'm going to talk about how our strategic actions we took in 2020 position each of our businesses to navigate what we expect will be another very dynamic year, one that will require us again to balance the very needs of all of our stakeholders. I'll also tell you about our growth framework and how our execution of it will drive our success throughout this challenging environment and beyond. Following my comments, Brian Evanko will share more details about our 2020 financial results and our 2021 outlook, and then we'll take your questions. At Cigna, we've been in a journey, an important one over the past two years to significantly accelerate our strategic path. During the 2020, we completed the integration of our combination with Express Scripts, and delivered on our integration priorities, including revenue growth, cash flow generation, de-leveraging targets, strong client retention, high levels of coworker retention, and working to keep our vision top of mind with innovations and improved affordability, predictability, and simplicity delivered to the market. In addition, we delivered another important milestone of our strategic journey by launching Evernorth, our health services platform, which has meaningfully grown our strategic partnerships and is bringing innovative solutions to the market already. We also made a series of leadership changes to align our capabilities and further operationalize our strategy, reinforcing our talent depth, and our commitment to continue to grow and develop our team. And based on the capital and cash flow strength of our company, we are demonstrating the ability to have [an and] [Ph] orientation to our capital deployment strategy. This means we're able to reinvest in our business for ongoing growth, and pay a meaningful quarterly dividend, and deployed substantial capital to share repurchase, and target and pursue strategic M&A. At the same time, we continue to execute effectively across each of our businesses by delivering value to our clients and customers or patients. In Evernorth, our 2020 adjusted revenue increased 20% driven by ongoing strong retention, the completion of Cigna volumes, and organic growth, including our partnership with Prime Therapeutics. In U.S. Commercial, our relentless support of our customers, and our employee clients and partners throughout the pandemic led to strong client retention levels again in 2020, along with better-than-expected in-group strength, building a solid foundation that we will carry into 2021. In U.S. Government, we grew our Medicare Advantage customer base by 18%, exceeding our annual growth target of 10% to 15%. And we expanded our geographic and product footprint to now be making market offerings in 20% of all available Medicare Advantage bio markets. In addition, 88% of Medicare Advantage and prescription drug paying customers in 2021 are in four-star plus rated plans, with our national weighted average of four-and-a-half stars, the highest amongst our national competitors. And in our International business, despite navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic in multiple countries, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings growth of 18% fueled by our strong partnerships. Related to Group Disability and Life, which we sold to New York Life, on December 31, I am proud of the way in which our team worked to deliver in a very challenging environment, fueled by the pandemic, for the benefit of our clients and customers. As a result of the pandemic, it created a significant reduction in our earnings contribution for our business last year. However, we remain focused on serving our clients and customers. Throughout 2021, we expect the macro environment to remain dynamic, which presents both challenges and opportunities for us. Among the challenges, we expect COVID-19 and the rollout of the vaccine to continue to tax an already overburdened healthcare system. And we expect intensified and much needed focus on health disparities to continue as well. At the same time, we also see opportunities. They include greater recognition of the importance of the employer-sponsored market with companies playing even more critical role in ensuring the wellbeing of their employees by offering comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services. There were also a number of accelerating trends that will further drive fundamental changes in healthcare. For example, pharmacological innovations are quickly becoming the future of healthcare driven in part by the continued rise in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, and the evolution of the biosimilars. There is also a greater recognition and acceptance of the link between mental health and physical health. And we see care access rapidly changing as a result of consumer behavior and technology and data innovation leading to growing use of virtual visits and coordinated home-based care all aided by advancements in remote monitoring as well. Against this backdrop, the progress we achieved in 2020 along with the strength of our capabilities that gives us confidence that we will deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 even in the face of COVID-19 headwinds primarily in the form of elevated medical costs. Our ability to achieve these levels of continued long-term success starts with growth framework which is three fundamental building blocks. First, we delivered differentiated value in the form of affordable, predictable, simple solutions for our clients, customers, and patients. This drives our ability to retain, further deepen, and grow our business platforms. Second, we work to partner and innovate. This enables us to rapidly bring new solutions to the market that creates even more value for our clients and customers. And it also fuels our third priority, the expansion of our addressable markets which we achieve by growing our geographic footprint further, by moving it to underpenetrated markets through service coordination, and through addition of new solutions that gives us the opportunity to sell to new buyer groups. Taken together, these building blocks provide us with multiple levers to continue to achieve differentiated and sustained growth not only in 2021, but over the long-term. In Evernorth, this means bringing an expanded set of solutions to our existing health plan, commercial and government clients by leveraging the strength of our pharmacy, care management, health intelligence, and benefit management capabilities. In U.S. healthcare, this means continue outstanding retention along with further deepening relationships and target new business adds. In U.S. government, it means delivering at our goal of accelerated customer growth of 10 to 15% in Medicare Advantage. It also means continue to expand our geographic footprint in the individual exchange market where, for example, in 2021 we will be offered in 220 counties. This is a more than 50% year-over-year increase. And in International, it means continuing to grow as we deliver differentiated value for our globally mobile customers as well as our supplemental health solution customer. We look forward to delving more deeply into our growth strategy with you at our Investor Day which is slated for March 8th. So, now to summarize, I am very proud of my colleagues in our company for delivering for our customers, patients, clients, partners, and shareholders in an extraordinary year by maintaining a relentless focus on delivering on our commitments and leading through a rapidly changing landscape. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our organization and our ability to thrive and deliver differentiated results in the most challenging of environments. We delivered strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow results in 2020. In 2021, we expect to deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share. And we will continue to drive attractive operating cash flow which fuels our ability to return value to our shareholders through a meaningful quarterly dividend and through ongoing share repurchase as well targeted M&A. Overall, we have confidence that we'll achieve our 2021 outlook and our long-term growth objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. First if we look back at 2020, I am very proud of the actions we have taken in the company to meet the needs of our customers, clients, provider partners, communities, and coworkers while also delivering on our commitment to our shareholders. And as we enter 2021, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value and driving growth across our businesses. My remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2020 results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and provide our outlook for 2021. The consolidated financial highlights for 2020 include adjusted revenue of $160 billion, adjusted earnings of $6.8 billion after-tax, adjusted earnings per share of $18.45 and operating cash flows of $10.4 billion. These results reflect strong execution across our businesses through an unprecedented environment. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted revenues grew to $30.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth strong results reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and new partnerships, effective execution of supply chain initiatives, and continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy. During the quarter, we fulfilled $388 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 19% increase for our fourth quarter 2019. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong fourth quarter as we completed our integration efforts and we entered 2021 with good momentum. Turning to U.S. Medical, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $9.7 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $328 million. These results reflect COVID-19 related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts in the quarter include the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, the costs of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and co-workers and decreased specialty contributions partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. As we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in direct COVID-19 costs for testing and treatment as incidence rates spiked across the country. While we also saw increased levels of care deferral for non-COVID costs during the latter part of the quarter, the direct COVID-19 costs outweighed the impact of lower non-COVID costs. Turning to membership, we ended the year with 16.7 million total medical customers. This represents less than a 0.5% declined sequentially excluding the loss of a 240,000 life claims as expected due to an acquisition, as our book of business remains resilient. We finished the year with 18% Medicare advantage customer growth and delivered mid single-digit growth in the Select and International segments, despite a challenged economic backdrop. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals and the impact of the increase in direct COVID-19 costs as we progressed through the fourth quarter. In our international markets business, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $91 million, reflecting the costs of actions taken to support customers and coworkers and investments in the business for future growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax earnings for this segment were $11 million, reflecting elevated life claims related to the pandemic and unfavorable disability claims. As previously noted, we completed the sale of the Group Disability and Life Business to New York Life on December 31, 2020. For our Corporate segment, the fourth quarter adjusted loss of $381 million reflects lower interest expenses due to lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall Cigna's 2020 results reflects focused execution across each of our businesses through a dynamic environment, as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve, while delivering strong financial results. As we turned to 2021, we have entered the year with strength and momentum driven by our strategic actions in 2020, which David detail. And we expect the environment in 2021 to continue to be dynamic presenting both challenges and opportunities for our business. Before going to our detailed outlook with the sale of our Group Disability and Life Business contributions from group should be removed for the purposes of year-over-year comparisons. With that for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $165 billion representing growth of approximately $10 billion after adjusting for 2020 group revenues. We expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion, or at least $20 per share. This is inclusive of an expected COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share. In 2021, we expect elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization. And we expect impact the gradual economic recovery on our customer base in 2021. Given these COVID-19 dynamics, we expect the primary impact to be in our U.S. medical business. Further, we expect the COVID-19 headwind to be more concentrated in the first quarter of the year, and so we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2021 to be more weighted to the final three quarters of the year. Specifically, we expect approximately 20% to 22% of 2021 earnings per share to emerge in the first quarter of the year. For 2021, we projected expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%, and a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. In Evernorth, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.6 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of at least 4%. In Evernorth, we expect the 2021 quarterly earnings cadence to be directionally in line with 2020. For 2021, we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts of at least $1.55 billion scripts. And we see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market through Evernorth, with less than 15% of our Evernorth revenues derived from Cigna's U.S. medical business, we have a significant external customer and client base, and we expect to continue to track the growth through existing and new Evernorth relationships. For U.S. Medical, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses driven by organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and disciplined expense management. This outlook also includes the projected impact of COVID-19. As I said earlier, the COVID-19 headwind primarily impacts our U.S. medical business with the greatest impact in the earlier part of 2021. Key assumptions reflected in our U.S. medical earnings outlook for 2021 include the following. Regarding total medical customers, we expect 2021 growth of at least 325,000 customers. This includes continued organic growth throughout the year in our commercial business led by the select and middle-market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect growth in our individual ACA business, which will be largely offset by our exit of our legacy non-ACA individual market offerings. We expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82% reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021, and continued focus execution and delivery of strong clinical quality across our U.S. commercial and government businesses. We also expect continued contributions from international markets. As we continue to deliver differentiated solutions that improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those reserves in our global markets. Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.3 billion pre-tax in 2021. All in for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses, as we deliver growth while navigating the headwind associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to our capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2020, we deployed $4.7 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 21.9 million shares of stock for $4.1 billion. We ended 2020 with the debt to capitalization ratio of 39.5% and improvement of 570 basis points over year-end 2019 as we met our de-leveraging targets of a debt to capitalization ratio of less than 40%. Now, framing our capital outlook for 2021, we entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of deployable capital from our strong cash flow generation in 2020, and the remaining proceeds of the Group sale, net of the expected debt repayment we announced on deal close. For 2021, we expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Combined, this gives us at least $10 billion to deploy in 2021, and positions us well to execute against our 2021 capital deployment priorities. First, we expect approximately $1 billion in tax payments and expenditures resulting from the Group sale. We also expect to deploy approximately $1 billion to capital expenditures primarily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, in line with our January quarterly dividend announcement. And we expect to largely deploy the remaining $6.6 billion for share repurchase and strategic M&A. Year-to-date, as of February 3, 2021, we have already repurchased 4.2 million shares for $906 million. For the purpose of the planning and 2021 earnings per share guidance, our outlook reflects the deployment of the vast majority of the $6.6 billion to share repurchase. Regarding M&A, we look for opportunities that are both strategically and financially attractive. And we would evaluate a given opportunity on its merits. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So to recap, our full-year 2020 consolidated results reflect strong execution led by our Evernorth segment. We enter 2021 with momentum. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full-year 2021 earnings outlook. Further, we strategically positioned our businesses to leverage our growth framework, and to be service-based and capital light. This positioning drives significant financial strength and flexibility, and gives us continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of our call.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Evanko. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Mr. Taylor, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Appreciate the details. I just want to go back to sort of thinking about the COVID headwinds this year. And I know '22 is a far way away, but from this distance should we be thinking about $20.00 plus $1.25, and then putting your long-term growth rate on that. Is there any reason not to sort of generally be thinking about that as the setup for 2022?\nDavid Cordani: Gary, good morning, it's David. As Brian noted, we estimate the $1.25 for 2021. Big picture, we think you should view it as transient or removable. I'd caution you from, at this early stage, penciling all of it as an immediate return in 2022. But to be very clear, we do believe it is removable or recoverable from that standpoint through a variety of forces. One, obviously the effectiveness and the ramping of the vaccine that will transpire from that standpoint; two, further evolution of both programs and services, as well as treatments and therapies relative to dealing with COVID, and then third, ultimately, if necessary, pricing actions activities. So big picture, agree with your conclusion. We'd just caution you not to harden it fully 100% into a 2022 number yet.\nGary Taylor: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great, thanks. And I guess the dynamic that you saw in Q4 around elevated medical costs kind of more than offsetting the decline in [indiscernible] this a little bit different than what we've seen from other companies, but I guess directionally similar with commentary about the impact to commercial versus Medicare. I guess maybe since you are kind of more commercially focused, maybe you could help draw a little bit of a distinction between how you expect utilization in the commercial business to rebound in 2021? Is there less pent up demand than what you might see in the Medicare business, and therefore commercial gets to more normal more quickly in 2021 than other business lines, just wanted to get your thoughts on that given your performance versus your peers in Q4.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few kind of framing comments, and then I'll get to the core of your question. Throughout 2020, as the pandemic emerged, we certainly did witness an inverse relationship between COVID-19 claims and deferred care. And if you step back all the way to the second quarter of 2020, the impact to care deferrals more than outweighed the direct costs associated with COVID-19 claims for testing and treatment across both our commercial and Medicare businesses. During the third quarter, these factors approximately offset one another, meaning the cost to COVID claims approximately offset the effective care deferrals. In the fourth quarter specifically, as the back half of the quarter emerged, we started to see the cost of COVID-19 claims for both testing and treatment start to exceed the benefits we were seeing from increased care deferral activity. And so we ended the quarter with performance of medical costs in aggregate that was modestly above our seasonal baseline. That effect was consistent across both the commercial and the Medicare book-to-business. Although I would note that the commercial care deferrals were lower than the Medicare care deferrals that we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's the way I would encourage you to think about it. And as we roll that forward into 2021, our guidance contemplates the respective books-to-business in the $1.25 headwind.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt Borsch: Yes, thank you. Maybe if I could just ask a question on that prior dialogue. So do I have it right that in Medicare you're actually seeing the direct costs of COVID as higher than the deferral in the fourth quarter, and if so do you expect that to continue into 2021?\nBrian Evanko: Morning, Matt. This is Brian. So yes, you have that right. For the fourth quarter we did see the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment exceed the benefits of care deferral for the quarter in aggregate, with the back half of the quarter where the acceleration really occurred. I would note though that the fourth quarter also saw elevated care deferral relative to the third quarter in Medicare. And again, as we roll that forward stepping into 2021, we assume that the first portion of the year there will be elevated medical cost experienced in our book of business across U.S. Medical. And then as the year unfolds that will gradually dissipate toward the back half of the year.\nMatt Borsch: Yes. And sorry, just one clarification, I'm trying to isolate Medicare, and not looking for any specific guidance but directionally Medicare. Just Medicare, to understand it in that book in the fourth quarter, it was the deferrals were less than treatment costs, and if that's expected to continue this year?\nBrian Evanko: In the fourth quarter, both our commercial and Medicare businesses in aggregate saw total claim costs that were modestly above the seasonal baseline.\nMatt Borsch: Okay, thank you.\nBrian Evanko: [Technical difficulty]\u2026\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Last year, you had talked about a potential opportunity to go back to customers and maybe take some risk off the table for them for 2021. I'm not sure if that program resonated or not and whether that had any impact on the guidance. And maybe if there are considerations around your stop loss book specifically for this year that we need to consider in terms of what's baked into the guidance. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Ralph, good morning. It's David. I think what you're reflecting back on is, as the pandemic, the breath and magnitude of it began to take hold and become obvious, we made the decision as an organization that we would seek to return all the favorable economics that were manifested because of COVID disruption to clients, customers, patients, our provider partners, and our coworkers. So you're reflecting back to that. We did take proactive action throughout the course of the year to work with clients, that's a client-by-client set of actions depending on the client's position, desire, funding mechanisms, et cetera, to both return value in absolute sense, and in some cases restructure programs with an eye toward 2021. In some cases you could think about the, call it, the risk sharing relationship with those clients may have moved somewhat depending, again, on the clients' preference. But that's again a client-by-client call. To the latter portion of your comment, I would say there's no meaningful different between stop loss either structure or performance expectation for 2020 versus 2021. And we continue to feel very good about the way stop loss is performing for piece of mind for our clients, as well as for ourselves.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the question. And maybe just on Evernorth and the guidance. If I look at this $5.6 billion of operating profit expectation, it doesn't seem like it bakes in too much underlying growth, if I'm thinking about this right. So I just wanted to talk through some of the pieces. And if you account for the expected benefit from the Anthem overhead costs rolling off, some of the incremental deal synergies, the Prime Scripts, just want to make sure I'm thinking about the underlying business there correctly, and what you guys are assuming the kind of organic underlying growth could be in this business for '21?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. So let me start, I'll ask Brian to add some additional specificity. Stepping back relative to the Evernorth platform, we're delighted. We're really pleased with the performance, the growth that is being realized because of the value that's being delivered to our clients. Our commercial clients, our helpline clients, our government clients, from that standpoint. Two is, to put a pin in it, this is specifically relative to transit overhead, we were able to more rapidly accelerate the extraction of this transit overhead largely because of executing our efficiency initiatives, but also the significant growth. So this transit overhead extraction was more accelerated from its initiation in 2019 through 2020. Third point, before I hand it over the Brain, I would just ask you to recognize the fact that we continue to invest significantly because of the rate and pace of growth in the business as we are continuing to add significant business to that portfolio, and we've called out before, investments that are being made relative to OpEx, largely operating expenses, to add our first phase of our Prime relationship. Now, we're evolving the second phase of the Prime relationship, and we're delighted to do so. And that will take place throughout the totality of 2021, while reinforcing the growth in the underlying strength. Meanwhile successfully continuing to grow earnings in line with our prior strategic target, we will look forward to providing you some additional insight relative to the forward-looking both revenue and earnings trajectory of that business at our investor day. Brian, some adds?\nBrian Evanko: The only comment I'd add on top of this, to remind you, Robert, that the 2020 performance, when you exclude transitioning clients it showed 20% revenue growth in Evernorth, and 22% growth in adjusted pharmacy scripts year-on-year. So coming off a very strong year in 2020, and stepping into 2021 with continued momentum.\nRobert Jones: That's fair. Thanks so much for the comments.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Lake, are you on mute? Moving on to our next question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank, your line is open, sir.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess as we think about the $1.25 headwind for calendar '21, are you able to give us an order of magnitude on what is the gross impact of the COVID headwind versus the gross impact of the expectations for reduced medical claims and reduced medical costs, that would be helpful, thank you.\nBrian Evanko: Morning, George. It's Brian. So I appreciate the question, and the nature of the way you structured it. I'm going to approach it maybe a little bit differently, but hopefully this will get at what you're looking for here. As we do mention the $1.25, I would encourage you to think about it in three broad categories. The first one being the impact of elevated COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination costs, as well as some of the pressure we anticipate in our revenue, for example, in our Medicare business. I would size that at about half of the $1.25. In fact, as it relates to the 2021 effect on our U.S. Medical book. And you'll see that primarily in the medical care ratio, or the MCR. The second component that's sizable is in customer volumes, again specifically in our U.S. Medical business, we would expect about 35% to 40% or so of that $1.25 to show up in the form of lower volumes due to the ongoing economic pressures associated with the pandemic and then the balance is smaller components that will show up in different parts of the company.\nGeorge Hill: Okay, maybe as a quick follow-up, is there any impact expected to the Evernorth segment?\nDavid Cordani: The Evernorth impact is quite modest. I would characterize it's immaterial relative to the size of that business.\nGeorge Hill: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mr. Goldwasser, are you on mute? Moving on to our next question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse, your line is open, sir.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just to ask about Evernorth, two aspects there, one with now enhanced capital for deployment. It seems like part of the story for Evernorth is diversifying the service offering beyond the pharmacy benefit focus that it currently has. Can you comment on how quickly and you think you can diversify and maybe update us on the areas that you're thinking about adding to the capability there and then just base it on Evernorth, there was some talk last year that the PBM selling season, people were renewing for a year because of the pandemic. And do you expect the selling season to have more RFPs than normal this year? Or is it sort of a normal RFP season from what you're seeing so far?\nDavid Cordani: A.J. good morning, it's David. Relative to your first question, the platforms that we're operating within Evernorth and again, we'll walk through it in some good detail at our Investor Day, there are four platforms within that portfolio are well performing pharmacy services, our care management or benefit management or health intelligence platforms that are functioning, operating, delivering significant value today, and each one of which we'll continue to be invested in first and foremost, organically. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment that we have within our portfolio and Evernorth is a part user of that $1 billion CapEx. Secondly, through partnerships, the way we work to partner in different ways, shapes and forms and thirdly, potentially, through M&A from that standpoint. But the platforms we have we feel quite good about as an illustration in terms of the M&A capabilities we've talked about expanding our ability to serve customers, where they are, and where they seek to be served, whether that's expanded virtual platforms, expanded in-home capabilities, et cetera through that lens. As it relates to your second question, the selling season et cetera grounded in the comments we made relative to just the very strong growth results we've put up over multiple years now. We'll be able to carry that momentum through 2021. We're pretty thick into the 2022 selling season right now. The health plan season is far along, the large commercial season is meaningfully along, and the middle market consortium selling season is in the early stages. As of right now we know we have two health plan losses for 2022. We've had essentially 99% plus retention up until that point for our health plan business and we would like to retain every client every day. And we know that that's not possible. But we have two no losses that have been written about in the marketplace. Notwithstanding that, we have visibility to meaningful new business ads from the 2022 selling season and we'll be able to continue to build on the momentum we posted for 2019 and 2020.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open sir.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. I'm hoping to hear David how central and important telemedicine is to Cigna and Cigna's strategy, thinking about how are you baking that into product design? How are you thinking about extended higher reimbursement deferral of patient copay, and does like remote passive digital monitoring of high risk patients fold into that picture, I'd just love to hear you talk about how central that is and how much say Cigna is pushing that as opposed to waiting on customers to pull that from you?\nDavid Cordani: So, good morning. It's interesting the way you ended in terms of push pull. We've talked before around our orientation is being we think about ourself as a consultative solution provider. So I pause a little bit on the push side of the equation, but stepping back, your framing I think is quite healthy. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we see the change in which care will be accessed and coordinated is one of the three defining trends over the decade in front of us. And we see significant opportunity to be clear. So let me agree, we see significant opportunity to deliver more value, more choice, more simplicity, with appropriate coordination back to customers and patients through effective use of virtual programs. This is well beyond telemedicine, it's well beyond Urgent Care triaging. There's longitudinal nature that is attached to that, it is aided by remote monitoring, it is aided by a coordinated system to make that longitudinal delivery work. We see this transcending from healthcare through behavioral health to coordinated health care and behavioral health services from that standpoint, and we see it as a significant opportunity. I'd also note that, we've been mindful in terms of the positioning of the corporation whereby we see that as not only a significant opportunity in the market, but for us, because we've sought not be positioned in, we'll call it bricks and mortar delivery or fixed delivery infrastructure, but having the flexibility of the variable delivery infrastructure that is aided for clients. And then lastly, we do see your point, you have the ability to design benefits; you have a virtual primary benefit structure that are being tested in the marketplace today. And you can push that, you can put that in the push category, but it's a choice that you would offer. And we've already seen some positive markers. So a significant opportunity, our company is positioned to pursue it. And you should expect us to spotlight this in a little bit more detail on March 8.\nDave Windley: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Can you hear me this time?\nDavid Cordani: Yes, we can, Justin.\nJustin Lake: Sorry about that. So couple quick numbers question, one the Evernorth revenues were materially higher than at least I was modeling yet it didn't seem to flow through to the bottom line in terms of earnings, which were more in line. So curious there, if there's anything I'm missing, and then on the exchange business, can you give us an update of a lot of competition there, I know you're rolling into a bunch of new markets, can you share with us how much new membership you expect to have there and any kind of margin impact, kind of versus typical targets that we should think about for '21? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, then, David will comment on the individual exchange part. In terms of the Evernorth business really pleased with the revenue performance that we drove in 2020, and your comment about the relationship to the earnings, couple of things I would keep in mind there. One is the relationship that came out with Prime Therapeutics, effective April 1st, and that became expanded on January 1, 2021. When we onboard any new clients, there's a level of startup cost associated with that, as we think about bringing on new headcount to make sure that we're ramped-up for the volumes that will come. So we had a little bit of expense related to the startup associated with our relationship with Prime Therapeutics in 2020. Additionally, the Cigna U.S. medical insourcing, which is now complete, brought revenue, but deminimis earnings contribution in 2020 to Evernorth. So those are really the two dynamics that caused a little bit of the revenue versus earnings growth difference that you think, David anything you want to call out relative to the individual business?\nDavid Cordani: Sure, Justin, good morning, relative to the business. First, we're pleased with the performance that we're stepping into 2021 with rolls to that portfolio. As I noted in our prepared remarks, we're expanding to counties, we're participating in by about 50%. Brian did also note that we're exiting the non-ACA portion of that business. As it relates to margins, Justin, I would remind you, we were early to note that a couple of years ago, we thought that that portfolio of businesses nationally was earning margins above a sustainable margin threshold and we said targets have to revert to a sustainable marketing threshold. And in fact, the MCR we posted this year, we indicate it would show some impact of the margins, more normalizing and that indeed to take place. As it relates to the 2021 and beyond positioning, we think that our margin targets are sustainable, given our provider relationships and our service proposition and we look to grow that portfolio.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning. So if you think about the commercial membership, like you mentioned you expect continued organic growth throughout the year in overall commercial membership. Curious if we can read into that maybe that Cigna is perhaps already troughed on the quarterly progression of commercial enrollment as it relates to COVID impact, economic impact etcetera. And then just within that with national accounts expect that to be down a little bit, any sense on when we may see the trough on that, whether it's early in the year or late in a year in 2021. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. I think you've identified several important features there. So, as it relates to commercial customers for 2021, as we expected to step into 2021 with about the number of customers we would end 2020 with, as relates to the years pattern. I'd ask you to think about it as follows. First, we expect the ongoing COVID impact to disenrollment to continue to have pressure on customers throughout the first-half of 2000, our customer number-- throughout the first-half of 2021. Second, as typically takes place in the national accounts segment, there are some non-COVID related disenrollment that happens historically in that business because most of the selling takes place during the first portion of the year. Offsetting that is continued growth and strength in the Select segment that has a very active selling season throughout the course of the year as well as some known middle market and new business ads that will take place during the middle portion of the year. Now, as it relates to looking forward, you asked the final part of your question relative to the trough in national accounts. Our early look at 2022 is we would expect a very attractive retention number at this point for our U.S. medical national account relationships, as well as the selling season has been pretty active right now for us. The RP volume is up. The quality of the RP volume is high. We have some new business opportunities wins that we have on board already. And we're an active pursuit. So we have a level of optimism relative to the outlook for that segment for January of 2022.\nSteven Valiquette: That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Mr. Goldwasser you are on mute. Moving on to our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research, your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Congrats, David and Brian, and the rest of the team on the new roles. So our question here is more around Cigna was relatively early in sort of that development of an ACO strategy. It seems like the market is certainly been catching up quickly. So was wondering if you could speak to your efforts around engaging providers, especially primary care physicians and maybe perhaps how that approach differs in your Medicare book versus your commercial book?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Good morning.\nDavid Cordani: So, relative to the ACO strategy, I think that's a broad definition of what the market calls value-based relationships and you're correct, we had an early start and a lot of passion and drive and therefore strategic direction relative to it. I would start with the end and that is the Medicare advantage book in general has a higher penetration of a comprehensive nature of value-based care relationships per customer that we serve versus commercial. So and you probably see that in other ways, you look at the marketplace, the primary care physicians integrated, multi-specialty physician groups, et cetera, tend to adapt many internalize value based care, more comprehensively for Medicare advantage given the population's health needs and the opportunity to deliver really significant value. The exciting and piece of it is we've been working now for a decade to prove that thesis in the commercial space. It varies by market in terms of the level of breadth and depth, but we have well in excess of 600 collaborative accountable care relationships that are up and running and delivering meaningful value. The more mature ones are delivering meaningful value for customers and clients. What does that mean? Clinical quality, so higher gaps in care closure, service quality, strong service experience, and improved affordability from that standpoint. And then the last comment I would add here is the market is always dynamic, but one of the impacts of COVID-19 is it, it jars everybody in every norm and as it relates to value based care, it puts a spotlight back on value-based care that shared risk and shared performance relationships. Now may look a little bit more palatable to some that may have not viewed it in the past and were more white to a fee-for-service model. So, we see an opportunity to further expand and deepen some of those relationships both in commercial specifically, but as well as in some of the Medicare advantage opportunities.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask again about the direct cover cost in this year in this $1.25 and [indiscernible] you gave it, but is there a way to give a split between maybe testing cost relative to treatment cost in that number that you expect this year? And I think there has been some talk about potential for changing rules where plans would be required to cover additional testing cost like about return-to-work kind of cost I think plans are currently covering, just wanted to get your sense first on that first part. And then, secondly, is that a big amount that you -- if that were to happen, how big amount is that in the testing scheme overall? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Charles. This is Brian. So in terms of the first part of your question there, dimensioning the test versus the treatment, we have gone through extensive modeling as you might imagine to project what we think is going to transpire in 2021, which led us to $1.25 COVID impact that described earlier. And as I went through to a previous question, we expect about half of that to come through in the form of elevated claim cost and/or revenue pressure in our U.S. Medical MCR book. So I am not going to split apart each of the different components in that for you. But just rest assured we've got a variety of projections that underlie that. So, David, maybe you want to comment on the effects of some other components?\nDavid Cordani: So, related to testing as we stand today first and foremost, the industry broadly speaking stepped in early clear and aggressively in support of clients and patients related to testing initially as well as evolving through process, procedures related to treatment. As it relates to what I would describe as unmed or worksite support, the posture has been thus far in term -- and good collaboration with HHS, I mean [indiscernible] staff, but that is outside of what an insurance or a service relationship should be. To the extent that we visited, we visited dynamically. But, that's typically carried by the employer through an unmed relationship or otherwise. It also reminds you that 85% of our commercial business is self-funded. So, we act as a fiduciary. I mean in cases where individual employers want assistance relative to that, we're proactively supporting through that lens. But we do not see that as (a), likely in the immediate future even relative to engagement on these topics this week, or (b), a needle mover for us given the makeup of our portfolio of businesses.\nCharles Rhyee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. Our next question is from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, good morning, Brian and David. So let me just pull up a little on the strategic capital deployment, and if you could just talk to maybe two dimensions on that? Appreciate your earlier comments. As you were talking about bricks and mortar being of less interest and specifying of the areas in virtual home and remote monitoring et cetera that were of interest, maybe you can just call out the distinction? Maybe I am putting too emphasis on physician practice as being bricks and mortar and excluding them as an area of focus. And then similarly if it's in Evernorth, will be more focused on providing these services to employers and health plans? Or, how much of the focus is providing these services to risk bearing primary care or other value based care sorts of companies? Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Hey, Lance. Good morning. It's David. I'll start with the latter portion of your question first. So, as we evolve our capabilities both the present states, but evolve our capabilities, you should think about in general all that happens within Evernorth. It happens within Evernorth as it relates to a platform of services to serve health plans, to serve corporate clients, to serve governmental agencies, and to offer services to, as you articulated, risk bearing or performance based healthcare delivery systems. And you should think about Cigna's U.S. Medical portfolio as a consumer of those services. Now clearly an important development partner, but a consumer of those services as another client of Evernorth. As it relates to the first portion of your question, I think your basic framing of it is right. And so, if just reiterate it and step it up a notch, our view is that the U.S. is not in need of more physical proximity and physical plant to serve the population in general, especially in urban and suburban areas. We obviously have additional need states relative to rural areas in that standpoint. Secondly, the consumer behavior in a variety of areas including healthcare has reinforced desire not an acceptance, but a desire for bringing care and services to me in a real-time basis in a highly personalized basis, therefore virtual care coordination, and obviously that's augmented with clinical staff, but it's bringing the service to the individual and an immediate real-time basis so long as it could be longitudinally managed and coordinated effectively. And then, the last point I want to be really clear on, our view of it is as a complimentary aspect to the care delivery system, not as addition to remediation play, but as a complimentary aspect, because to make it work properly, it needs to be connected back into the healthcare delivery system. And we have many examples of it working today in our approach to virtual, both for medical as well as behavioral. We just see the ability to ramp it significantly given both the demand and the acceptance, and then the tool availability.\nLance Wilkes: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our last question will come from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a question just maybe helping us to think about the Medicare advantage margin progression that you're thinking about for 2021 in 2022 and particular maybe if you can call out, I don't know maybe within that $25 headwind from COVID just how you're, what you're thinking specifically about the impact from the lower raps in 2022, which I guess would probably impacting you a bit more just because of all the enrollment growth, the 18% growth that you had in MA just last year, but then as we go into 2022 how much sort of improvement in margin you could potentially get as you normalize the raps. And then also it looks like we have a pretty solid base rate update from CMS as well in terms of that 4% plus.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. A few components to your question there, and just broadly the way I would encourage you to think about it is, we're on a multi-year growth turning for this business, right? And we're a year or two of our geographic and product expansion with the expectation of 10% to 15% annual growth. Really happy with the 18% growth we put up in '20. AND well on track to achieve 10% to 15% and '21. The margin profile tends to vary for a few different reasons. One is when we go into a new market, there tends to be a build-up in terms of investments, in people, in marketing before the customers start to come in. Two is when we rate a new customer, typically there's a bit of a ramp relative to profitability from a durational standpoint due to the risk adjustment coding, which you've appropriately called out. Thirdly, due to the unique nature of 2020 and the COVID-19 headwinds that we faced, the results of lower utilization, right? So as a result of that, we were not able to get all of the risk adjustment codes that we would in a normal year, if you will. We factored all that in due to 2021 outlook, the $1.25 earnings per share headwinds that we've called out here. A component to that is associated with Medicare advantage and it's associated with lower revenue that we would have otherwise anticipated having. So, as you kind of step forward as David said in the beginning 2022 and thereafter, we expect some of that will work itself out. And we're not going to give you exact 2022 guidance here today, that's the way I would encourage you to think about the margin profile.\nScott Fidel: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. I will now turn conference back over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you. So just to wrap up, I'd like to highlight a few key points from today's discussion. First, I'm very proud of the way in which our colleagues supported the needs of our stakeholders throughout this pandemic, while also ensuring that we delivered on our shareholder commitment. We delivered solid 2020 financial results, including revenue and EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow. And our strong 2020 performance and the strength of our businesses give us confidence that we will achieve continued attractive growth in 2021 and beyond driven by a significant increase in revenue, ongoing profit growth, and very attractive cash flow performance. We thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to going into more depth with you around our growth plans at our Investor Day, which is slated for March 8. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's fourth quarter 2020 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David. Good morning everyone. First if we look back at 2020, I am very proud of the actions we have taken in the company to meet the needs of our customers, clients, provider partners, communities, and coworkers while also delivering on our commitment to our shareholders. And as we enter 2021, we remain focused on delivering differentiated value and driving growth across our businesses. My remarks today, I'll review Cigna's 2020 results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and provide our outlook for 2021. The consolidated financial highlights for 2020 include adjusted revenue of $160 billion, adjusted earnings of $6.8 billion after-tax, adjusted earnings per share of $18.45 and operating cash flows of $10.4 billion. These results reflect strong execution across our businesses through an unprecedented environment. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2020 adjusted revenues grew to $30.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth strong results reflect organic growth with outstanding client retention and new partnerships, effective execution of supply chain initiatives, and continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy. During the quarter, we fulfilled $388 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 19% increase for our fourth quarter 2019. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong fourth quarter as we completed our integration efforts and we entered 2021 with good momentum. Turning to U.S. Medical, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $9.7 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $328 million. These results reflect COVID-19 related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts in the quarter include the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, the costs of actions we have taken to support customers, providers and co-workers and decreased specialty contributions partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID utilization. As we progressed through the fourth quarter, we experienced an increase in direct COVID-19 costs for testing and treatment as incidence rates spiked across the country. While we also saw increased levels of care deferral for non-COVID costs during the latter part of the quarter, the direct COVID-19 costs outweighed the impact of lower non-COVID costs. Turning to membership, we ended the year with 16.7 million total medical customers. This represents less than a 0.5% declined sequentially excluding the loss of a 240,000 life claims as expected due to an acquisition, as our book of business remains resilient. We finished the year with 18% Medicare advantage customer growth and delivered mid single-digit growth in the Select and International segments, despite a challenged economic backdrop. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. Medical segment reflects strong fundamentals and the impact of the increase in direct COVID-19 costs as we progressed through the fourth quarter. In our international markets business, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $91 million, reflecting the costs of actions taken to support customers and coworkers and investments in the business for future growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Fourth quarter adjusted pretax earnings for this segment were $11 million, reflecting elevated life claims related to the pandemic and unfavorable disability claims. As previously noted, we completed the sale of the Group Disability and Life Business to New York Life on December 31, 2020. For our Corporate segment, the fourth quarter adjusted loss of $381 million reflects lower interest expenses due to lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall Cigna's 2020 results reflects focused execution across each of our businesses through a dynamic environment, as we continue to meet the needs of those we serve, while delivering strong financial results. As we turned to 2021, we have entered the year with strength and momentum driven by our strategic actions in 2020, which David detail. And we expect the environment in 2021 to continue to be dynamic presenting both challenges and opportunities for our business. Before going to our detailed outlook with the sale of our Group Disability and Life Business contributions from group should be removed for the purposes of year-over-year comparisons. With that for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $165 billion representing growth of approximately $10 billion after adjusting for 2020 group revenues. We expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion, or at least $20 per share. This is inclusive of an expected COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share. In 2021, we expect elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization. And we expect impact the gradual economic recovery on our customer base in 2021. Given these COVID-19 dynamics, we expect the primary impact to be in our U.S. medical business. Further, we expect the COVID-19 headwind to be more concentrated in the first quarter of the year, and so we would expect the cadence of earnings per share in 2021 to be more weighted to the final three quarters of the year. Specifically, we expect approximately 20% to 22% of 2021 earnings per share to emerge in the first quarter of the year. For 2021, we projected expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%, and a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. In Evernorth, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.6 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of at least 4%. In Evernorth, we expect the 2021 quarterly earnings cadence to be directionally in line with 2020. For 2021, we expect adjusted pharmacy scripts of at least $1.55 billion scripts. And we see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market through Evernorth, with less than 15% of our Evernorth revenues derived from Cigna's U.S. medical business, we have a significant external customer and client base, and we expect to continue to track the growth through existing and new Evernorth relationships. For U.S. Medical, we expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses driven by organic customer growth, deepening of customer relationships and disciplined expense management. This outlook also includes the projected impact of COVID-19. As I said earlier, the COVID-19 headwind primarily impacts our U.S. medical business with the greatest impact in the earlier part of 2021. Key assumptions reflected in our U.S. medical earnings outlook for 2021 include the following. Regarding total medical customers, we expect 2021 growth of at least 325,000 customers. This includes continued organic growth throughout the year in our commercial business led by the select and middle-market segments, partially offset by lower national accounts enrollment. We also expect Medicare advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%, and we expect growth in our individual ACA business, which will be largely offset by our exit of our legacy non-ACA individual market offerings. We expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82% reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs and more normalized non-COVID utilization, the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021, and continued focus execution and delivery of strong clinical quality across our U.S. commercial and government businesses. We also expect continued contributions from international markets. As we continue to deliver differentiated solutions that improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those reserves in our global markets. Regarding interest expense, we expect costs of approximately $1.3 billion pre-tax in 2021. All in for full-year 2021, we expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion or at least $20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses, as we deliver growth while navigating the headwind associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to our capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2020, we deployed $4.7 billion to repay debt and we repurchased 21.9 million shares of stock for $4.1 billion. We ended 2020 with the debt to capitalization ratio of 39.5% and improvement of 570 basis points over year-end 2019 as we met our de-leveraging targets of a debt to capitalization ratio of less than 40%. Now, framing our capital outlook for 2021, we entered 2021 with $2.5 billion of deployable capital from our strong cash flow generation in 2020, and the remaining proceeds of the Group sale, net of the expected debt repayment we announced on deal close. For 2021, we expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Combined, this gives us at least $10 billion to deploy in 2021, and positions us well to execute against our 2021 capital deployment priorities. First, we expect approximately $1 billion in tax payments and expenditures resulting from the Group sale. We also expect to deploy approximately $1 billion to capital expenditures primarily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, in line with our January quarterly dividend announcement. And we expect to largely deploy the remaining $6.6 billion for share repurchase and strategic M&A. Year-to-date, as of February 3, 2021, we have already repurchased 4.2 million shares for $906 million. For the purpose of the planning and 2021 earnings per share guidance, our outlook reflects the deployment of the vast majority of the $6.6 billion to share repurchase. Regarding M&A, we look for opportunities that are both strategically and financially attractive. And we would evaluate a given opportunity on its merits. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So to recap, our full-year 2020 consolidated results reflect strong execution led by our Evernorth segment. We enter 2021 with momentum. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full-year 2021 earnings outlook. Further, we strategically positioned our businesses to leverage our growth framework, and to be service-based and capital light. This positioning drives significant financial strength and flexibility, and gives us continued confidence in our long-term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of our call. Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few kind of framing comments, and then I'll get to the core of your question. Throughout 2020, as the pandemic emerged, we certainly did witness an inverse relationship between COVID-19 claims and deferred care. And if you step back all the way to the second quarter of 2020, the impact to care deferrals more than outweighed the direct costs associated with COVID-19 claims for testing and treatment across both our commercial and Medicare businesses. During the third quarter, these factors approximately offset one another, meaning the cost to COVID claims approximately offset the effective care deferrals. In the fourth quarter specifically, as the back half of the quarter emerged, we started to see the cost of COVID-19 claims for both testing and treatment start to exceed the benefits we were seeing from increased care deferral activity. And so we ended the quarter with performance of medical costs in aggregate that was modestly above our seasonal baseline. That effect was consistent across both the commercial and the Medicare book-to-business. Although I would note that the commercial care deferrals were lower than the Medicare care deferrals that we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's the way I would encourage you to think about it. And as we roll that forward into 2021, our guidance contemplates the respective books-to-business in the $1.25 headwind. Morning, Matt. This is Brian. So yes, you have that right. For the fourth quarter we did see the direct cost of COVID-19 testing and treatment exceed the benefits of care deferral for the quarter in aggregate, with the back half of the quarter where the acceleration really occurred. I would note though that the fourth quarter also saw elevated care deferral relative to the third quarter in Medicare. And again, as we roll that forward stepping into 2021, we assume that the first portion of the year there will be elevated medical cost experienced in our book of business across U.S. Medical. And then as the year unfolds that will gradually dissipate toward the back half of the year. In the fourth quarter, both our commercial and Medicare businesses in aggregate saw total claim costs that were modestly above the seasonal baseline. [Technical difficulty]... The only comment I'd add on top of this, to remind you, Robert, that the 2020 performance, when you exclude transitioning clients it showed 20% revenue growth in Evernorth, and 22% growth in adjusted pharmacy scripts year-on-year. So coming off a very strong year in 2020, and stepping into 2021 with continued momentum. Morning, George. It's Brian. So I appreciate the question, and the nature of the way you structured it. I'm going to approach it maybe a little bit differently, but hopefully this will get at what you're looking for here. As we do mention the $1.25, I would encourage you to think about it in three broad categories. The first one being the impact of elevated COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination costs, as well as some of the pressure we anticipate in our revenue, for example, in our Medicare business. I would size that at about half of the $1.25. In fact, as it relates to the 2021 effect on our U.S. Medical book. And you'll see that primarily in the medical care ratio, or the MCR. The second component that's sizable is in customer volumes, again specifically in our U.S. Medical business, we would expect about 35% to 40% or so of that $1.25 to show up in the form of lower volumes due to the ongoing economic pressures associated with the pandemic and then the balance is smaller components that will show up in different parts of the company. Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, then, David will comment on the individual exchange part. In terms of the Evernorth business really pleased with the revenue performance that we drove in 2020, and your comment about the relationship to the earnings, couple of things I would keep in mind there. One is the relationship that came out with Prime Therapeutics, effective April 1st, and that became expanded on January 1, 2021. When we onboard any new clients, there's a level of startup cost associated with that, as we think about bringing on new headcount to make sure that we're ramped-up for the volumes that will come. So we had a little bit of expense related to the startup associated with our relationship with Prime Therapeutics in 2020. Additionally, the Cigna U.S. medical insourcing, which is now complete, brought revenue, but deminimis earnings contribution in 2020 to Evernorth. So those are really the two dynamics that caused a little bit of the revenue versus earnings growth difference that you think, David anything you want to call out relative to the individual business? Good morning, Charles. This is Brian. So in terms of the first part of your question there, dimensioning the test versus the treatment, we have gone through extensive modeling as you might imagine to project what we think is going to transpire in 2021, which led us to $1.25 COVID impact that described earlier. And as I went through to a previous question, we expect about half of that to come through in the form of elevated claim cost and/or revenue pressure in our U.S. Medical MCR book. So I am not going to split apart each of the different components in that for you. But just rest assured we've got a variety of projections that underlie that. So, David, maybe you want to comment on the effects of some other components? Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. A few components to your question there, and just broadly the way I would encourage you to think about it is, we're on a multi-year growth turning for this business, right? And we're a year or two of our geographic and product expansion with the expectation of 10% to 15% annual growth. Really happy with the 18% growth we put up in '20. AND well on track to achieve 10% to 15% and '21. The margin profile tends to vary for a few different reasons. One is when we go into a new market, there tends to be a build-up in terms of investments, in people, in marketing before the customers start to come in. Two is when we rate a new customer, typically there's a bit of a ramp relative to profitability from a durational standpoint due to the risk adjustment coding, which you've appropriately called out. Thirdly, due to the unique nature of 2020 and the COVID-19 headwinds that we faced, the results of lower utilization, right? So as a result of that, we were not able to get all of the risk adjustment codes that we would in a normal year, if you will. We factored all that in due to 2021 outlook, the $1.25 earnings per share headwinds that we've called out here. A component to that is associated with Medicare advantage and it's associated with lower revenue that we would have otherwise anticipated having. So, as you kind of step forward as David said in the beginning 2022 and thereafter, we expect some of that will work itself out. And we're not going to give you exact 2022 guidance here today, that's the way I would encourage you to think about the margin profile."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thank you, Alexis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. When we met a year ago, the challenges from COVID-19 were just beginning to fully emerge around the globe. With the arrival of vaccines, 2021 is likely to be a year of transition, as communities and businesses seek to turn the page. I am very proud of the ways in which our 70,000-plus colleagues led, and continue to lead through this difficult time for customers, our clients, our providers, our partners, and our communities. Starting last spring, we were amongst the first to waive out-of-pocket costs COVID-19 testing as well as treatment. Our Evernorth business quickly leveraged our supply chain expertise to ensure a consistent prescription drug supply and delivery during the uncertain times. In our U.S. Medical Business, we ramped up to meet the significant increased demand for behavioral health services by growing our network, adding virtual provider partners, creating demand webcasts, treating first responders, and adding search capabilities for provider ethnicity. All over, we were deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to support our clients and partners who were hit hardest by the pandemic. In partnership with New York Life, we launched the Brave of Heart Fund to provide charitable grants for families, frontline workers, and volunteers who lost loved ones to COVID-19. And last month, our Cigna Medical Group was amongst the first non-hospital organizations in the nation to administer antibody therapy for high-risk COVID-19 patients, freeing up much needed hospital space. And just a few weeks ago, we partnered with industry leaders from across the public and private sectors to ensure that people who received the vaccine had digital access to the vaccination records so they can safely return to their jobs and daily activities. As we continue to work to serve our clients, our customers, and our patients during the pandemic, we also balanced our responsibility to deliver for shareholders as well. For 2020 full-year, we grew our adjusted revenue by 14%, to $160 billion. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $18.45, consistent with our overall expectations, which included the ongoing elevated cost of COVID-19-related services. Today, I'm going to talk about how our strategic actions we took in 2020 position each of our businesses to navigate what we expect will be another very dynamic year, one that will require us again to balance the very needs of all of our stakeholders. I'll also tell you about our growth framework and how our execution of it will drive our success throughout this challenging environment and beyond. Following my comments, Brian Evanko will share more details about our 2020 financial results and our 2021 outlook, and then we'll take your questions. At Cigna, we've been in a journey, an important one over the past two years to significantly accelerate our strategic path. During the 2020, we completed the integration of our combination with Express Scripts, and delivered on our integration priorities, including revenue growth, cash flow generation, de-leveraging targets, strong client retention, high levels of coworker retention, and working to keep our vision top of mind with innovations and improved affordability, predictability, and simplicity delivered to the market. In addition, we delivered another important milestone of our strategic journey by launching Evernorth, our health services platform, which has meaningfully grown our strategic partnerships and is bringing innovative solutions to the market already. We also made a series of leadership changes to align our capabilities and further operationalize our strategy, reinforcing our talent depth, and our commitment to continue to grow and develop our team. And based on the capital and cash flow strength of our company, we are demonstrating the ability to have [an and] [Ph] orientation to our capital deployment strategy. This means we're able to reinvest in our business for ongoing growth, and pay a meaningful quarterly dividend, and deployed substantial capital to share repurchase, and target and pursue strategic M&A. At the same time, we continue to execute effectively across each of our businesses by delivering value to our clients and customers or patients. In Evernorth, our 2020 adjusted revenue increased 20% driven by ongoing strong retention, the completion of Cigna volumes, and organic growth, including our partnership with Prime Therapeutics. In U.S. Commercial, our relentless support of our customers, and our employee clients and partners throughout the pandemic led to strong client retention levels again in 2020, along with better-than-expected in-group strength, building a solid foundation that we will carry into 2021. In U.S. Government, we grew our Medicare Advantage customer base by 18%, exceeding our annual growth target of 10% to 15%. And we expanded our geographic and product footprint to now be making market offerings in 20% of all available Medicare Advantage bio markets. In addition, 88% of Medicare Advantage and prescription drug paying customers in 2021 are in four-star plus rated plans, with our national weighted average of four-and-a-half stars, the highest amongst our national competitors. And in our International business, despite navigating the challenges of the ongoing pandemic in multiple countries, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings growth of 18% fueled by our strong partnerships. Related to Group Disability and Life, which we sold to New York Life, on December 31, I am proud of the way in which our team worked to deliver in a very challenging environment, fueled by the pandemic, for the benefit of our clients and customers. As a result of the pandemic, it created a significant reduction in our earnings contribution for our business last year. However, we remain focused on serving our clients and customers. Throughout 2021, we expect the macro environment to remain dynamic, which presents both challenges and opportunities for us. Among the challenges, we expect COVID-19 and the rollout of the vaccine to continue to tax an already overburdened healthcare system. And we expect intensified and much needed focus on health disparities to continue as well. At the same time, we also see opportunities. They include greater recognition of the importance of the employer-sponsored market with companies playing even more critical role in ensuring the wellbeing of their employees by offering comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services. There were also a number of accelerating trends that will further drive fundamental changes in healthcare. For example, pharmacological innovations are quickly becoming the future of healthcare driven in part by the continued rise in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, and the evolution of the biosimilars. There is also a greater recognition and acceptance of the link between mental health and physical health. And we see care access rapidly changing as a result of consumer behavior and technology and data innovation leading to growing use of virtual visits and coordinated home-based care all aided by advancements in remote monitoring as well. Against this backdrop, the progress we achieved in 2020 along with the strength of our capabilities that gives us confidence that we will deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021 even in the face of COVID-19 headwinds primarily in the form of elevated medical costs. Our ability to achieve these levels of continued long-term success starts with growth framework which is three fundamental building blocks. First, we delivered differentiated value in the form of affordable, predictable, simple solutions for our clients, customers, and patients. This drives our ability to retain, further deepen, and grow our business platforms. Second, we work to partner and innovate. This enables us to rapidly bring new solutions to the market that creates even more value for our clients and customers. And it also fuels our third priority, the expansion of our addressable markets which we achieve by growing our geographic footprint further, by moving it to underpenetrated markets through service coordination, and through addition of new solutions that gives us the opportunity to sell to new buyer groups. Taken together, these building blocks provide us with multiple levers to continue to achieve differentiated and sustained growth not only in 2021, but over the long-term. In Evernorth, this means bringing an expanded set of solutions to our existing health plan, commercial and government clients by leveraging the strength of our pharmacy, care management, health intelligence, and benefit management capabilities. In U.S. healthcare, this means continue outstanding retention along with further deepening relationships and target new business adds. In U.S. government, it means delivering at our goal of accelerated customer growth of 10 to 15% in Medicare Advantage. It also means continue to expand our geographic footprint in the individual exchange market where, for example, in 2021 we will be offered in 220 counties. This is a more than 50% year-over-year increase. And in International, it means continuing to grow as we deliver differentiated value for our globally mobile customers as well as our supplemental health solution customer. We look forward to delving more deeply into our growth strategy with you at our Investor Day which is slated for March 8th. So, now to summarize, I am very proud of my colleagues in our company for delivering for our customers, patients, clients, partners, and shareholders in an extraordinary year by maintaining a relentless focus on delivering on our commitments and leading through a rapidly changing landscape. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our organization and our ability to thrive and deliver differentiated results in the most challenging of environments. We delivered strong revenue, earnings, and cash flow results in 2020. In 2021, we expect to deliver at least $20 of adjusted earnings per share. And we will continue to drive attractive operating cash flow which fuels our ability to return value to our shareholders through a meaningful quarterly dividend and through ongoing share repurchase as well targeted M&A. Overall, we have confidence that we'll achieve our 2021 outlook and our long-term growth objectives. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Gary, good morning, it's David. As Brian noted, we estimate the $1.25 for 2021. Big picture, we think you should view it as transient or removable. I'd caution you from, at this early stage, penciling all of it as an immediate return in 2022. But to be very clear, we do believe it is removable or recoverable from that standpoint through a variety of forces. One, obviously the effectiveness and the ramping of the vaccine that will transpire from that standpoint; two, further evolution of both programs and services, as well as treatments and therapies relative to dealing with COVID, and then third, ultimately, if necessary, pricing actions activities. So big picture, agree with your conclusion. We'd just caution you not to harden it fully 100% into a 2022 number yet. Ralph, good morning. It's David. I think what you're reflecting back on is, as the pandemic, the breath and magnitude of it began to take hold and become obvious, we made the decision as an organization that we would seek to return all the favorable economics that were manifested because of COVID disruption to clients, customers, patients, our provider partners, and our coworkers. So you're reflecting back to that. We did take proactive action throughout the course of the year to work with clients, that's a client-by-client set of actions depending on the client's position, desire, funding mechanisms, et cetera, to both return value in absolute sense, and in some cases restructure programs with an eye toward 2021. In some cases you could think about the, call it, the risk sharing relationship with those clients may have moved somewhat depending, again, on the clients' preference. But that's again a client-by-client call. To the latter portion of your comment, I would say there's no meaningful different between stop loss either structure or performance expectation for 2020 versus 2021. And we continue to feel very good about the way stop loss is performing for piece of mind for our clients, as well as for ourselves. Good morning. It's David. So let me start, I'll ask Brian to add some additional specificity. Stepping back relative to the Evernorth platform, we're delighted. We're really pleased with the performance, the growth that is being realized because of the value that's being delivered to our clients. Our commercial clients, our helpline clients, our government clients, from that standpoint. Two is, to put a pin in it, this is specifically relative to transit overhead, we were able to more rapidly accelerate the extraction of this transit overhead largely because of executing our efficiency initiatives, but also the significant growth. So this transit overhead extraction was more accelerated from its initiation in 2019 through 2020. Third point, before I hand it over the Brain, I would just ask you to recognize the fact that we continue to invest significantly because of the rate and pace of growth in the business as we are continuing to add significant business to that portfolio, and we've called out before, investments that are being made relative to OpEx, largely operating expenses, to add our first phase of our Prime relationship. Now, we're evolving the second phase of the Prime relationship, and we're delighted to do so. And that will take place throughout the totality of 2021, while reinforcing the growth in the underlying strength. Meanwhile successfully continuing to grow earnings in line with our prior strategic target, we will look forward to providing you some additional insight relative to the forward-looking both revenue and earnings trajectory of that business at our investor day. Brian, some adds? The Evernorth impact is quite modest. I would characterize it's immaterial relative to the size of that business. A.J. good morning, it's David. Relative to your first question, the platforms that we're operating within Evernorth and again, we'll walk through it in some good detail at our Investor Day, there are four platforms within that portfolio are well performing pharmacy services, our care management or benefit management or health intelligence platforms that are functioning, operating, delivering significant value today, and each one of which we'll continue to be invested in first and foremost, organically. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment that we have within our portfolio and Evernorth is a part user of that $1 billion CapEx. Secondly, through partnerships, the way we work to partner in different ways, shapes and forms and thirdly, potentially, through M&A from that standpoint. But the platforms we have we feel quite good about as an illustration in terms of the M&A capabilities we've talked about expanding our ability to serve customers, where they are, and where they seek to be served, whether that's expanded virtual platforms, expanded in-home capabilities, et cetera through that lens. As it relates to your second question, the selling season et cetera grounded in the comments we made relative to just the very strong growth results we've put up over multiple years now. We'll be able to carry that momentum through 2021. We're pretty thick into the 2022 selling season right now. The health plan season is far along, the large commercial season is meaningfully along, and the middle market consortium selling season is in the early stages. As of right now we know we have two health plan losses for 2022. We've had essentially 99% plus retention up until that point for our health plan business and we would like to retain every client every day. And we know that that's not possible. But we have two no losses that have been written about in the marketplace. Notwithstanding that, we have visibility to meaningful new business ads from the 2022 selling season and we'll be able to continue to build on the momentum we posted for 2019 and 2020. So, good morning. It's interesting the way you ended in terms of push pull. We've talked before around our orientation is being we think about ourself as a consultative solution provider. So I pause a little bit on the push side of the equation, but stepping back, your framing I think is quite healthy. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we see the change in which care will be accessed and coordinated is one of the three defining trends over the decade in front of us. And we see significant opportunity to be clear. So let me agree, we see significant opportunity to deliver more value, more choice, more simplicity, with appropriate coordination back to customers and patients through effective use of virtual programs. This is well beyond telemedicine, it's well beyond Urgent Care triaging. There's longitudinal nature that is attached to that, it is aided by remote monitoring, it is aided by a coordinated system to make that longitudinal delivery work. We see this transcending from healthcare through behavioral health to coordinated health care and behavioral health services from that standpoint, and we see it as a significant opportunity. I'd also note that, we've been mindful in terms of the positioning of the corporation whereby we see that as not only a significant opportunity in the market, but for us, because we've sought not be positioned in, we'll call it bricks and mortar delivery or fixed delivery infrastructure, but having the flexibility of the variable delivery infrastructure that is aided for clients. And then lastly, we do see your point, you have the ability to design benefits; you have a virtual primary benefit structure that are being tested in the marketplace today. And you can push that, you can put that in the push category, but it's a choice that you would offer. And we've already seen some positive markers. So a significant opportunity, our company is positioned to pursue it. And you should expect us to spotlight this in a little bit more detail on March 8. Yes, we can, Justin. Sure, Justin, good morning, relative to the business. First, we're pleased with the performance that we're stepping into 2021 with rolls to that portfolio. As I noted in our prepared remarks, we're expanding to counties, we're participating in by about 50%. Brian did also note that we're exiting the non-ACA portion of that business. As it relates to margins, Justin, I would remind you, we were early to note that a couple of years ago, we thought that that portfolio of businesses nationally was earning margins above a sustainable margin threshold and we said targets have to revert to a sustainable marketing threshold. And in fact, the MCR we posted this year, we indicate it would show some impact of the margins, more normalizing and that indeed to take place. As it relates to the 2021 and beyond positioning, we think that our margin targets are sustainable, given our provider relationships and our service proposition and we look to grow that portfolio. Good morning. It's David. I think you've identified several important features there. So, as it relates to commercial customers for 2021, as we expected to step into 2021 with about the number of customers we would end 2020 with, as relates to the years pattern. I'd ask you to think about it as follows. First, we expect the ongoing COVID impact to disenrollment to continue to have pressure on customers throughout the first-half of 2000, our customer number-- throughout the first-half of 2021. Second, as typically takes place in the national accounts segment, there are some non-COVID related disenrollment that happens historically in that business because most of the selling takes place during the first portion of the year. Offsetting that is continued growth and strength in the Select segment that has a very active selling season throughout the course of the year as well as some known middle market and new business ads that will take place during the middle portion of the year. Now, as it relates to looking forward, you asked the final part of your question relative to the trough in national accounts. Our early look at 2022 is we would expect a very attractive retention number at this point for our U.S. medical national account relationships, as well as the selling season has been pretty active right now for us. The RP volume is up. The quality of the RP volume is high. We have some new business opportunities wins that we have on board already. And we're an active pursuit. So we have a level of optimism relative to the outlook for that segment for January of 2022. Good morning Josh. So, relative to the ACO strategy, I think that's a broad definition of what the market calls value-based relationships and you're correct, we had an early start and a lot of passion and drive and therefore strategic direction relative to it. I would start with the end and that is the Medicare advantage book in general has a higher penetration of a comprehensive nature of value-based care relationships per customer that we serve versus commercial. So and you probably see that in other ways, you look at the marketplace, the primary care physicians integrated, multi-specialty physician groups, et cetera, tend to adapt many internalize value based care, more comprehensively for Medicare advantage given the population's health needs and the opportunity to deliver really significant value. The exciting and piece of it is we've been working now for a decade to prove that thesis in the commercial space. It varies by market in terms of the level of breadth and depth, but we have well in excess of 600 collaborative accountable care relationships that are up and running and delivering meaningful value. The more mature ones are delivering meaningful value for customers and clients. What does that mean? Clinical quality, so higher gaps in care closure, service quality, strong service experience, and improved affordability from that standpoint. And then the last comment I would add here is the market is always dynamic, but one of the impacts of COVID-19 is it, it jars everybody in every norm and as it relates to value based care, it puts a spotlight back on value-based care that shared risk and shared performance relationships. Now may look a little bit more palatable to some that may have not viewed it in the past and were more white to a fee-for-service model. So, we see an opportunity to further expand and deepen some of those relationships both in commercial specifically, but as well as in some of the Medicare advantage opportunities. So, related to testing as we stand today first and foremost, the industry broadly speaking stepped in early clear and aggressively in support of clients and patients related to testing initially as well as evolving through process, procedures related to treatment. As it relates to what I would describe as unmed or worksite support, the posture has been thus far in term -- and good collaboration with HHS, I mean [indiscernible] staff, but that is outside of what an insurance or a service relationship should be. To the extent that we visited, we visited dynamically. But, that's typically carried by the employer through an unmed relationship or otherwise. It also reminds you that 85% of our commercial business is self-funded. So, we act as a fiduciary. I mean in cases where individual employers want assistance relative to that, we're proactively supporting through that lens. But we do not see that as (a), likely in the immediate future even relative to engagement on these topics this week, or (b), a needle mover for us given the makeup of our portfolio of businesses. Hey, Lance. Good morning. It's David. I'll start with the latter portion of your question first. So, as we evolve our capabilities both the present states, but evolve our capabilities, you should think about in general all that happens within Evernorth. It happens within Evernorth as it relates to a platform of services to serve health plans, to serve corporate clients, to serve governmental agencies, and to offer services to, as you articulated, risk bearing or performance based healthcare delivery systems. And you should think about Cigna's U.S. Medical portfolio as a consumer of those services. Now clearly an important development partner, but a consumer of those services as another client of Evernorth. As it relates to the first portion of your question, I think your basic framing of it is right. And so, if just reiterate it and step it up a notch, our view is that the U.S. is not in need of more physical proximity and physical plant to serve the population in general, especially in urban and suburban areas. We obviously have additional need states relative to rural areas in that standpoint. Secondly, the consumer behavior in a variety of areas including healthcare has reinforced desire not an acceptance, but a desire for bringing care and services to me in a real-time basis in a highly personalized basis, therefore virtual care coordination, and obviously that's augmented with clinical staff, but it's bringing the service to the individual and an immediate real-time basis so long as it could be longitudinally managed and coordinated effectively. And then, the last point I want to be really clear on, our view of it is as a complimentary aspect to the care delivery system, not as addition to remediation play, but as a complimentary aspect, because to make it work properly, it needs to be connected back into the healthcare delivery system. And we have many examples of it working today in our approach to virtual, both for medical as well as behavioral. We just see the ability to ramp it significantly given both the demand and the acceptance, and then the tool availability. Thank you. So just to wrap up, I'd like to highlight a few key points from today's discussion. First, I'm very proud of the way in which our colleagues supported the needs of our stakeholders throughout this pandemic, while also ensuring that we delivered on our shareholder commitment. We delivered solid 2020 financial results, including revenue and EPS growth and outstanding free cash flow. And our strong 2020 performance and the strength of our businesses give us confidence that we will achieve continued attractive growth in 2021 and beyond driven by a significant increase in revenue, ongoing profit growth, and very attractive cash flow performance. We thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to going into more depth with you around our growth plans at our Investor Day, which is slated for March 8. Have a good day."

We will begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones.\nAlexis Jones: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna\u2019s third quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholder\u2019s net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today\u2019s earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, with our reporting for third quarter 2020, we have updated our segment names to align with our launch of Evernorth and to better reflect a suite of services offered across our portfolio. The segment previously reported as Health Services is now reported as Evernorth and the segment previously reported as Integrated Medical is now reported as U.S Medical. There are no changes to the underlying businesses reported in either segment. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded in after-tax special item charge of $83 million or $0.23 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded a special item benefit of $89 million after-tax or $0.24 per share for a contractual adjustment for a former client. Finally, we recorded a special item benefit of $76 million after-tax or $0.21 per share for the receipt of payments related to our risk quarter claim. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. Finally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna\u2019s Group Disability and Life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I will begin by providing a few brief comments on Tuesday\u2019s election results, which are certainly top of mind for all of us. Then, I will speak to how Cigna\u2019s strategy accelerated by our recent launch of Evernorth, positions us to continue building on our history of delivering strong performance in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments. I will also provide comments on our strong third quarter results and I will conclude a few brief overview comments relative to 2021 before turning the call over to Eric. First, relative to the election. Certainly, we along with everybody else awaits to see a clear and orderly conclusion. Regardless of the final outcome, our mission to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of those we serve around the world has not changed and is more critical than ever. We are ready to continue engaging in critical discussions on healthcare with members of both sides of the aisle at federal, state and local levels. And we look forward to working constructively with the current administration or a new administration as we have been privileged to do so in the past. Looking forward, the long-term health needs of individuals and society at large transcends the results of any particular election or political climate. There is no question that simply continuing with the status quo for healthcare is not sufficient under any circumstances. Take for example that today\u2019s children are likely to be the first generation in American history to live shorter lives than their parents. Clearly, this is unacceptable. And the COVID-19 crisis has only reinforced our unsustainable healthcare challenges, including eroding individual health status, increased mental health impacts from heightened stress, anxiety and loneliness, health disparities and social determinants of health, and gaps in our healthcare delivery infrastructure. Many U.S. states are seeing their healthcare systems overwhelmed and only exacerbated by the underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes that increase the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. The bottomline is that there is no one healthcare system that is perfectly positioned. In our view, the conversation regarding healthcare must focus less on who pays the cost of an unsustainable system. In fact, systems around the world continue to struggle with unsustainability and rising costs including nationalized systems. What is important is that we work together to find solutions to meet the diverse underlying needs that are unique to a population in the most effective way possible. Regardless of the political climate, more than ever, people, governments and employers, as well as health plans are looking for healthcare systems that focus on keeping people healthy and not just treating them when they are sick, caring for the whole person, both mind and body and ensuring the most affordable, high value delivery of healthcare services. At Cigna, we are delivering on this promise and our strategy is designed to answer the call for healthcare system that is more affordable, predictable and simple. Our strategy guides us to customize our solutions to meet the diverse needs of our clients, our customers and our patients, and look at every decision and action we take to ensure it is addressing the demands for more value. We have amassed a targeted portfolio of capabilities to accelerate this direction and when combined with our partnership orientation, our focus on data driven innovation and capital flexibility, we are positioned to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and sustainable attractive growth. As you know, we recently introduced Evernorth, an evolution of our high performing health service portfolio and another important milestone in delivering on our strategy. With Evernorth, we have a distinct and dedicated platform of services and innovative healthcare solutions for health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. The launch of this new brand in September was met with overwhelming support and excitement from these viral groups. Through this dedicated platform we were demonstrating our commitment to meet their unique needs and invest in their success. Additionally, the platform further reinforces our position as the partner of choice to create more shared value for our clients and open their customers. A recent example of this is our growing partnership with Prime Therapeutics. Through our Prime relationship, we expand our retail pharmacy network and rebate administration services to more Americans through their 23 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. We achieve this by enhancing the retail pharmacy network and increasing affordability from pharmaceutical manufacturers. With Evernorth, our relationship with Prime will be further expanded. This includes the option for Prime\u2019s plans to access the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and Express Scripts\u2019 home delivery in network pharmacies beginning on January 1, 2021. Evernorth reinforces our deep commitment to leverage our broad capabilities to serve health plans, employers, government entities and healthcare professionals, and pursue mutually beneficial partnerships. At the same time, we are continuing to further invest in our Cigna brand, under which are U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International businesses go to market. We will continue be known for a customer- and client-focus approach and for delivering industry leading trends and outstanding customer service. For example, I am pleased to announce that our Medicare Advantage business achieved an annual customer Net Promoter Score of plus 74, the fourth consecutive year we have shown an increase. In addition in 2021, 88% of our customers will be in four-star plus rated plans and we are the only major plan to achieve an increase year-over-year. This is just one example and important one of our Cigna-branded companies will continue to deliver differentiated value in the marketplace. With Cigna and the recent addition of Evernorth platform, we now have two powerful brands from which to drive sustained growth today and well into the future. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results that were in line with our expectations. As a result, and as expected, we experienced the return of elevated utilization to more typical levels and ongoing impact of COVID-19. We also continue to take actions to support our customers, our clients, our coworkers, our healthcare professionals and our communities in these exceptionally challenging times. Additionally, we remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna and Express Scripts by the end of this year. Our consolidated revenue was $40.8 billion with after-tax earnings of $1.6 billion. In our Evernorth segment, we continue to deliver strong performance, demonstrating the value we bring to health plans, employers and government clients. Within the U.S. Medical segment, we saw an increase in cost as expected as utilization returned to more typical levels. And our International business continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth, as we meet the needs of our global customers as they navigate the disrupted environment due to COVID-19. With our strong third quarter results, we are confident that we will achieve our updated 2020 revenue and EPS outlook. Looking forward to 2021, we have a number of tailwinds including continued growth momentum, favorable impacts from synergies from our Express Scripts combination and further administrative synergies. We expect year-over-year headwinds from increased medical costs largely driven by the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Diving a bit more deeply into our growth momentum, we expect to drive continue to organic growth across each of our well-positioned platforms. I\u2019d specifically highlight strong growth within our pharmacy service portfolio, including specialty and underlying script growth aided by projected 98% client retention level and continued expansion of our U.S. Government business including Medicare Advantage, where we continue to drive both strong market and product expansion, as well as in-market growth, putting us on track for customer growth in our targeted range of 10% to 15% in 2021 and an individual changes where we have increased our addressable market footprint by over 50%. All-in, we are positioned for both very strong revenue and continued earnings growth in 2021, and we remain on track to achieve our strategic goal of $20 to $21 of EPS. We expect a strong operating momentum and capitalized framework to drive attractive operating cash flows of greater than $8 million. This significant cash flow generation combined with our ongoing deleveraging will give us significant strategic and financial flexibility for 2021 and beyond. Now to summarize before turning it over to Eric. Cigna has a long history of delivering strong performance in dynamic rapidly evolving environments, focused first and foremost on addressing the health and well-being needs of the individuals we serve. This approach transcends the results of any particular election cycle. We continue to build on this foundation as we delivered another strong quarter driven by the outstanding dedication of our more than 70,000 colleagues around the world who focused every day on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. Our mission and our strategy as champions were affordable, predictable and simple healthcare will continue to guide us, as we provide exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. And the launch of Evernorth will further fuel our strategy and expand our ability to serve more individuals. Finally, as we usually do, we look forward to providing more detailed and complete guidance for 2021 on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will turn it over to Eric.\nEric Palmer: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna\u2019s third quarter results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter of 2020 include, adjusted revenues of $40.8 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.41. Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflects focused execution across our businesses in a dynamic rapidly evolving environment. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter adjusted revenues grew to $30 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.4 billion. As previously discussed, in Evernorth, the cadence of quarterly earnings is more typical in 2020 than in 2019, where earnings were more weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of certain supply chain initiatives. Evernorth\u2019s strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth and customers and script volumes, the effective execution of supply chain initiatives and continued performance and expansion of specialty pharmacy services through Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy. We fulfilled 381 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 22% increase over the third quarter of 2019. Overall, Evernorth continued its positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to our U.S. Medical segment. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $9.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $757 million. These results reflect unfavorable prior period development, primarily related to the second quarter of 2020, COVID-19-related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts include the return of medical utilization to more typical levels, the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, decreased especially contributions and lower net investment income. It also reflects the actions we have taken throughout the year to support our stakeholders in this disruptive environment. For all customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment. For our Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for in-office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. For clients, we have provided premium relief programs and for our providers, we have implemented a variety of financial assistance programs. I am proud of the way that we at Cigna continue to respond to the pandemic in support of our stakeholders. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with $17 million global medical customers, less than a 1% decline sequentially. Our U.S. commercial book of business remains resilient due to the industry mix of our clients and continued commitments that employers are making to the health and wellbeing of their employees through COVID. We also continue to see growth in Medicare Advantage, where we have grown membership 18% through the end of the third quarter and we also continue to grow in the Select segment. Overall, with the exception of the unfavorable prior period development, results in our U.S. Medical segment are in line with our expectations. Turning to our International markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $208 million, reflecting continued operational efficiency, lower claims due to COVID-19 and ongoing business growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Third quarter adjusted pretax earnings for the segment were $70 million, reflecting elevated life claims due to the pandemic. For our Corporate segment, the third quarter of 2020 loss of $356 million reflects lower interest expenses due to the lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall, as a result of focused execution in a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results. Now, looking forward to our outlook for full year 2020. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our portfolio of businesses. We expect medical utilization to remain at more typical levels with continued direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment and we expect some increase in commercial disenrollment due to continued dislocation in the broader labor market. In the fourth quarter, we will also continue to make investments to support our clients, customers and employees in this disrupted environment. And taken as a whole, we now expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $158 billion and we now expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.30 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the fourth quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management and the effective deployment of capital. Now moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, third quarter cash flows from operations of $895 million, reflect the additional third quarter tax payments of approximately $826 million that was delayed from the second quarter as permitted under the CARES Act, as well as the payment of $445 million for the health insurance tax for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, cash flows from operations were $6 billion, and for 2020, we now expect cash flows from operations of greater than $8 billion. Our businesses generated substantial amount of cash flow and in combination with $5.3 billion in net proceeds expected from the sale of our Group Disability and Life business, we have significant capital and financial flexibility. Through the end of the third quarter, we deployed $1.7 billion to debt repayment and our debt to capitalization ratio of 42.8% as of September 30th is improved from 45.2% in December 31, 2019. We are at $1.2 billion of cash available at the parents at the end of the third quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $16 million shares of stock for $2.9 billion. Following the close of the group transaction, free cash available to the parents is expected to be at least $7 billion and we expect to deploy $4 billion to $5 billion to return our debt to capitalization ratio below 40%. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our third quarter consolidated results reflect focused execution across our businesses and the dynamic rapidly evolving environment with particular strength the momentum in our Evernorth segment. We are well positioned to meet the financial targets we have established for 2020, all while continuing to support our clients, customers and employees, and as such, we now expect 2020 full year adjusted EPS of $18.30 per share to $18.60 per share and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask, first, can you give us a little more color on the negative development that you said that you attributed to the second quarter in terms of the drivers and maybe what business would have been? And then, secondly, can you give us any update on the deal close, what states or what needs to happen to get this close and what you might give us some more fulsome kind of thought process around capital deployment given post that deal close over the next 12 months, 14 months, you will have somewhere by my math $8 billion to $10 billion to deploy, but thoughts on dividend things like that? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. So I will start with the reserve development piece first. So stepping back here about, just to remind you, as we look back to the second quarter, we had significantly lower utilization in April and May, and as we close out the second quarter we had to make estimates around the claims associated with the month of June. Now with the benefit of hindsight, utilization in the month of June came back a little bit faster than we previously estimated. So the way I\u2019d have you think about this Justin is we recorded about 1 point in the loss ratio in the third quarter that really should have been back in the second quarter. So, again, think about 100 basis points on the loss ratio in this third quarter results relating to in-year reserve development that\u2019s associated with the second quarter. That\u2019s the headline in terms of the reserve development. As you think about the thesis, I would point that primarily to the Commercial business in terms of the line of business, et cetera. In terms of the deal close, to go to that part of your question, we are on track for closing in the fourth quarter. We have put out a release a couple of -- in September, so a handful of weeks to go now, nothing that we had 55 out of the 65 required regulatory approvals. We now have 63 of the 65 required regulatory approval, so we are right at the cusp of getting that transaction closed and going from there. I will let David take the kind of forward-looking comments in terms of capital deployment and the like.\nDavid Cordani: Justin, good morning. Appreciate your question. And embedded in your question is acknowledgement of the strategic positioning of our portfolio. As you noted, we will be producing a significant -- need to produce a significant amount of cash flow that is deployable from that standpoint. From our point of view, stepping back, as noted in Eric\u2019s prepared remarks, you saw that we were pretty active in the share repurchase domain over the third quarter and saw some tremendous opportunity there. Specific to your question, as I noted, we are going to look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call and you might expect that as we complete our group closure, as Eric articulated in the fourth quarter and stepping into the first quarter, we have an opportunity not just to refresh our 2021 outlook, but also to refresh our capital deployment priorities and alike off of that very strong base. So we look forward to that conversation.\nJustin Lake: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. First, a clarification and then a question, in the slide deck you do explicitly still point to the $20 to $21 in 2021. So I just wanted to confirm you are explicitly affirming that today. It just wasn\u2019t featured real prominently in the release. So I do want to make sure on that. And then, my question is on your experience-rated Commercial business, are there going to be premium or MLR headwinds because of lower utilization as you move into 2021 or has there been enough customer relief, so to speak, that it skews out that dynamic?\nEric Palmer: Hi, Gary. It\u2019s Eric. So on the first one, just to be clear, yes, we are reaffirming the $20 to $21 target and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any ambiguity on that. That\u2019s been a target we have had for some time and we continue to be on track for that. So, again, I think the short answer to that question is, yes. On the experience-rated business, so as customers, as our clients have different levels of utilization and if there are favorable utilization, we accrue for that in the period. So, I would not think about there being any future headwinds here. Many kind of the dynamics associated with lower utilization are already reflected in the results and in the current period. So I would not think about that as a headwind in the future.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. I wanted to revisit the Medicare Advantage growth targets. When you unveiled the new MA strategy last year, you laid out 10% to 15% membership growth targets with 2020 serving as a stepping stone year. You are now on track to outperform the high end of that target in year one and it looks like you will have a very attractive product offering for 2021? So is it fair to say that your formal growth targets even at the high end might be a bit conservative when we think about 2021 membership growth? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Andrew, good morning. It\u2019s David. Thanks for referring me to the question. So stepping back, we are delighted with our performance in 2020 for starters, and as we laid out that multiyear 10% to 15% growth objective. We also underscored the fact that we were going to systematically expand our positioning in the market from less than 20% of the addressable market in 2019 to 50% of the addressable market 2024. So we are systematically expanding our geographies and we have added a new platform in terms of individual PPO in 2020. So that continues to carry forward. As it relates to 2021, our view of -- our positioning of our offerings in the marketplace, we feel quite good about that. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we have a strong base to jump off of relative to 80% star rating and a Net Promoter Score of 74. We remain committed to that 10% to 15% range. We look forward to providing you updates as we go forward. We always strive to perform at our best. And I appreciate your optimism and make sure that the senior team knows your optimism as well relative to this, but we are excited to end 2020 with a strong year and step into 2021 with some great growth momentum and look forward to continuing that beyond 2021.\nAndrew Mok: Got it. If I could just have a quick follow up. How are you thinking about potential inorganic opportunities related to the senior platform? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: So specific to inorganic opportunities, we have continued to have a portfolio of inorganic priorities. We have historically had five priorities or so that we have walked through and we previously refreshed them about a year ago at our Investor Day from that standpoint and U.S. seniors remains on that list. The underpinning growth chassis for this business is an organic growth chassis, to be clear. So we will be opportunistic and always open minded relative to inorganic opportunities. But the growth chassis here is an organic growth chassis aided by our end market growth, our platform expansion into individual PPO, our new market entry, which I referenced before, as well as over time additional employer, right, with growth from that standpoint. So it\u2019s organic first and opportunistic on an organic as appropriate in the future.\nAndrew Mok: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Valiquette. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe just ask about, I think, this is the first quarterly call you have done since you established the Evernorth business as a separate distinct entity. Maybe just give us a little bit of your thinking behind that decision to move that into the separate entity and begin to have its own brand identification. What does it say about where the company is going in terms of incremental business lines that that might pursue, tuck-in acquisitions, service capabilities and just give us a little bit more of your thinking about where you are going with the Evernorth business?\nDavid Cordani: A.J., good morning. It\u2019s David. So specifically relative to Evernorth, as I noted, we are quite excited to have launched that in September. We view it as a further reinforcement of an acceleration of our health service strategy. We have talked for quite some time as a business -- an evolving business portfolio of services and a health service portfolio. Specific to Evernorth, the way I\u2019d ask you to think about it is, one, it\u2019s a further reinforcement of the dedication we have of resources for supporting large complex employer needs, health plan needs, governmental entity needs, both federal as well as state agency needs, as well as healthcare-integrated systems and healthcare providers who were taking performance based risks or value based programs around that. Within our portfolio today, we have a large well performing pharmacy services portfolio solutions, we have a benefit management solutions to bring forward to the marketplace, we have care management solutions and a growing portfolio of data and analytics solutions from that standpoint. And lastly, to your comment, we see this not only as an attractive organic growth platform and our performance reinforces that we are building from strength, but also an opportunity for tuck-in or expansion capabilities as we go forward. And illustratively from that standpoint, we continue to see the opportunity to expand services that we offer to individuals around care delivery and care coordination from that standpoint, embracing technology, embracing virtual services, expanding our home healthcare capabilities, et cetera. We are readily building some of those capabilities organically today and we will be opportunistic from an inorganic standpoint. So just an acceleration of our service portfolio, dedication of resources, reinforcing our partner of choice orientation and a very broad portfolio of services today that will continue to expand for the benefit of those we can serve.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Can you just give us some feedback on the integrated PBM and medical offering, as you guys are a year further past the integration with Express Scripts and kind of how that\u2019s going into 2021. Are employers looking at that integration or the table stakes, and sort of if that\u2019s the case, what are the key differentiators you are going to market with?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, good morning. It\u2019s David. So, first, as a backdrop, as you know, we have had a long history within the Cigna portfolio of integrated offerings from employers, with a deep conviction relative to integrating those offerings with medical off of the then Cigna PBM, behavioral health, and care management services and that continues. The combination helps us further strengthen that value proposition in terms of furthering the affordability dimension of it, but also bringing some more systemic flexibility for solution design that we can bring toward middle market and larger client from that standpoint. And I would say that that continues, continued traction relative to the integrated proposition. In addition to that, our results show the underlying strength of the pharmacy services from a point solution as we think about it or a specific either PBM, PBM and specialty, or broader suite of services around that. And then through Evernorth, we see the opportunity to further expand that by coordinating, say, behavior health with pharmacy services going forward. So to the core of your question, our strength and momentum continues, the strong clinical outcomes we are delivering continues, many employer/buyers value that integrated proposition and were oriented around that within the Cigna brand, but some larger corporate buyers orient still around either an a la carte or point solution and increasingly looking for some additional leverage around that, we talked about coordinated benefits by bringing, say, pharmacy and behavioral together to coordinate those services and as a combined corporation with the Cigna brand and the Evernorth brand, we are really well-positioned to deliver for either buyer orientation.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nKevin Fischbeck: Hi. Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the commercial membership trends. In the quarter, you mentioned that things are getting better in part because of furloughs or also in part because of your customer segments that you are targeting. It sounds like you are assuming that attrition will accelerate in the future. But I guess, have your thoughts changed at all about the size of the decline that you might see during this recession and how resilient your customer membership might be over the next few quarters even with unemployment at these levels?\nDavid Cordani: So, Kevin, good morning. It\u2019s David. First, as we get into the commercial conversation, I do want to pause for a second and recognize from what we see is just a tremendous contribution that employers are making right now in these disruptive times facing COVID. We are seeing employers of all sizes work, stretch, innovate to do everything possible to support their employees and their family members, whether those are expanded services, additional coverages relative to testing and treatment costs. And they are working tirelessly to either minimize the layoffs or when they need to transpire, doing them through furloughs and having coordination. So I do think it\u2019s important to pause there and recognize the power of that system right now and corporations of all shapes and sizes working really hard to support individuals. As it relates to membership, as Eric noted, in the big picture of a disruptive environment, we are pleased with our performance. Our portfolio tends to be well-positioned by industry sub-segment and our transparency of our programs has us highly aligned with employers. For example, through the third quarter, our employer clients because of our transparent funding mechanisms have about $3 billion less spending than they otherwise would have projected to have given the environment and the continuity of cash flow that takes place around that is quite helpful, above and beyond that we have taken some additional steps. As we look forward, we know it\u2019s a disruptive environment. We expect right now as we look at the environment that we will continue to see employer customer disruption throughout the residual part of this year and into 2021. That\u2019s factored into our outlook when we talk about 2021 in detail. Next quarter, we will try to give you more insight relative to that. We are expecting, net-net, with our new growth, as well as retention as well this enrollment, we would go from the end of this calendar year\u2019s number to the beginning 2021 with approximately stable commercial membership, as we continue selling to Select segment, continue to have some retention losses, but all within our strategic range. And then throughout the course of the year, while we expect to see some continued disenrollment pressure, our outlook relative to growth is quite positive with some known traction into 2021. We expect to see some slight growth going forward. So, all in all, in a highly disruptive environment, we are very pleased with the results were able to deliver and we are fortunate to be partnered with so many commercial clients that are putting their employees first front and center.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you talk a little bit more about how the onboarding Prime has gone and the opportunity not just on the retail but on the specialty side? And how the option or I guess options perhaps works for each of the blues? And then what impact that could have either in 2021 or if we have to consider a certain cost and whether it\u2019s more of 2020 impact? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Ralph. So, first and foremost, relative to Prime, as I noted in the prepared remarks, we work every day to try to earn that right to be as we call it an undisputed partner of choice. It\u2019s a strategic imperative. It guides our actions and underlying that, we need to have the products, programs and services to deliver value. But we also have to have the orientation to partner and to seek mutual alignment. We are pleased with the early configuration with Prime. We established that and stood up in April of this calendar year and it\u2019s performing well. The further dedication we had around Evernorth and our performance relative to that first expansion services earned us the right, as we noted, too and the opportunity to be able to serve Prime in a more expansive basis. We will see that growth continue systematically throughout 2021. As I noted in my prepared remarks, the plans have choices. We are a choice-based framework. But the, for example, the Accredo value proposition is a tremendous value proposition and we are excited to expand that starting in January 1st for many of the Prime plans. There\u2019s investments -- there\u2019s ongoing investments we are making. That\u2019s factored in to our outlook for this year. There will be further investments we are making in the fourth quarter of this year for the tremendous underpinning of growth around that. But we are well-positioned to be able to make that happen and achieve our goals and objectives for 2020 that Eric noted in terms of our refreshed objective and as we get into the detailed 2021 guidance next quarter, we will try to give you a little bit more color. But we just see this as an ongoing expansion of a mutually beneficial relationship, where we are able to create together some tremendous value that individuals will benefit from as we expand those we are able to serve.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Market. Your line is open, sir.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. I was hoping to just ask about the level of medical trend particularly in your commercial book but Medicare too that you are seeing now and I am trying to understand if we put aside the actions that you have taken to grant relief to patients and providers and just look at it from the standpoint of the recovery and utilization plus the direct cost of COVID. Are you below trend, above trend or at trend and where do you expect that to go as we get into next year?\nEric Palmer: Matt, it\u2019s Eric. Good morning. So, with respect to the component pieces, I touched on it a little bit on my prepared remarks, but to unpack the components. I would have you think about putting COVID aside, utilization being slightly below kind of what we would have said would be normal. So call it 95%-ish for the third quarter in terms of kind of normal levels of utilization. When you add on top of that the impact of testing and treatment for COVID and on top of that the additional actions that we have taken to reduce barriers or reduce cost sharing and to ensure our customers have access to the care, that puts you all together a little bit above the normal. And you might remember, in the second quarter, we had set an expectation that the loss ratio for the second half of this year would be elevated relative to what you otherwise might call it a normal loss ratio. So when you put those pieces together, those are that big building blocks. The only other thing I note is, it really does vary by geography. So as we have had the COVID play in and out of different geographies that kind of move things up and down and such. But, again, when you roll it all up together in aggregate, it would be consistent with what I just described.\nMatthew Borsch: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Borsch. Our next question is from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Windley, are you on mute? Mr. Windley, we are unable to hear you with your question. We will move on to the next question, who is Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just interested if you can just throw in a bit more on, I know David had mentioned as one of the tailwinds for 2021 being some opportunities for administrative savings. And just interested if you have established or can identify a specific cost savings target yet or -- and if not, maybe just talk about some of the key buckets of admin savings opportunity that you see for 2021? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Yeah. Scott, it\u2019s Eric. Good morning. So I would not call out any particular initiative or program. I think about the opportunity here as really being much more in our continued ongoing drive for improving affordability of our services overall. I mean, just think about things like leveraging technology, improving the efficiency, automation, et cetera, of all the different processes throughout the organization. But, I think, again, it\u2019s just part of the culture of us continuing to create efficiencies versus any particular program.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Fidel. Our next question is from John Ransom with Raymond James. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Ransom: Hey. Good morning. A two-part question, if you would. Number one, how do you think about the materiality if at all if the unlikely event happens that there\u2019s a wholesale pharma manufacturer revolt against 340B discounts at contract pharmacies? And then, secondly, we are seeing an acceleration of the rise of these new models that promise 20%, 30%, 40% savings on medical trend by integrating primary care doctors and data. Are you still committed to your CPI goal and do you think that the market can just continue to sustain mid single digit-trends for Evernorth or do you think the industry is vulnerable as the trend continues to kind of double and triple CPI? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: It\u2019s David. Let me take it in reverse order. So when we step forward and put forth the CPI goal and objective, I think, it caused the market to question whether or not that was theoretical possible or otherwise. But it was a conversation that needs to be had, because we established it around an orientation that it was a symbol of sustainability, not that it was perfect, but it\u2019s a symbol of sustainability. Said otherwise, if total basket of goods costs from a societal standpoint are increasing by X, whatever X is, 2%, businesses need to find a way to approximate that to create a level of sustainability or better from that standpoint. And we are proud of the fact that we have delivered the lowest medical cost trend, and by the way the lowest pharmacy trend in our space as best anybody could tell apples-to-apples year in, year out. So that continuation is mission critical. This is a unique year, as everybody knows, relative to COVID in terms of disrupting the trend. But we continue to drive toward that. Second within the context of your question, we see many, to your term, disruptive or innovative models to drive step function improvements and we have many clients today pre-COVID that are benefiting from CPI or well better than CPI trend who are on the highly innovative dimension of consumer engagement, incentive alignment, heavy leverage and utilization of value-based care provider groups and center of excellence leverage from that standpoint, et cetera, et cetera. So, you used the word disruption, I will use the word innovation. We see the need for relentless drive relative to that, because as I noted in my prepared remarks, we can\u2019t continue to afford and no society can continue to afford paying at the levels that are being driven. The last point I\u2019d make here is, our open-framed partner orientation has us embrace, if you will, innovators or disruptors be they care delivery systems or alike from that standpoint. So, more to follow here. I appreciate you highlighting it and we remain extremely committed to driving optimal value here. As it relates to your first point, there\u2019s a bunch of, I\u2019d say, hypotheticals and theoreticals within that. The way I hear your first point though more broadly is, it\u2019s another example of pressing for a sustained affordability 340B was designed with a specific purpose and intent in mind. There are many hospitals and delivery system infrastructures that need 340B to make them work. It\u2019s an interesting time to have that conversation, whereby delivery system infrastructures are strained in ways we haven\u2019t seen in the past due to COVID causing massive revenue ramifications, of which governmental intervention and some player like our self and others in our space are providing support from that standpoint. So, it\u2019s an interesting time to have that theoretical conversation, but unlike most programs it will most likely evolve and our broader service portfolio is positioned to evolve with it.\nJohn Ransom: Thanks so much.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Ransom. And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess just a couple clarifications on Evernorth. I mean, first, just to follow-up on Josh\u2019s question on the Integrated Medical pharmacy offering. I am just curious if you are actually seeing less desire or less PBM carve-outs in the market today or is it still something more of a discussion point with your customers? And then just on the quarter, Evernorth did see a fairly meaningful step up in OpEx and you touched on some of these items. Just curious, is that kind of more one-time in nature this year versus next year or is this probably or potentially a more permanent level of spend as we think about the Evernorth business?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Rob. It\u2019s David. I will take the first question and I will ask Eric to address your second question. The simple answer is, no. We don\u2019t see a C change in terms of buyer behavior relative to wanting more of or less of. It\u2019s one client at a time. We have a very much of a consultative orientation trying to find the right configuration of benefits and funding mechanisms that work for clients. Now, within that, our Select segment is an integrated offering, full stop, period, the end. It\u2019s designed to be an integrated offering, whether it\u2019s on an ASO platform or a guarantee cost platform. As you move upmarket into commercial employer space within middle market and national accounts, you see different buying behaviors and it ebbs and flows. And I think the important message here is that, as an entity, we are extremely well-positioned to deliver what a client wants, whether they want a fully integrated offering, whether they want a point solution, a best-in-class PBM or best-in-class specialty pharmacy or both from that standpoint, or increasingly you are looking to get some additional value off coordination of services, be it care management services, behavior health, et cetera, relative to that. But I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a C change. I would say think about Evernorth and Cigna together as being extremely well-positioned to deliver on the value that buyers want, be it integrated, point solutions if you want standalone pharmacy services in this case or evolving some coordination of services to get another step function of value that come along with that. Eric?\nEric Palmer: Yeah. On the G&A ratio, in particular, there\u2019s just a couple of things I call out here. At the most macro level, we do continue to spend and continue to invest in building additional capabilities in this business and you see that in the G&A. There are a couple of other impacts that caused it as well. One, as you might remember, we talked a bit in the past, after the close of the acquisition, just kind of rebuilding of the amortization. So the amortization on the assets you acquired gets reset and then we have to rebuild that expense into that -- have built over the -- up over time. Offsetting that is us continuing to work to find synergies and find additional efficiencies. So, again, those would be the biggest buckets that play into that ratio in any given quarter. But it\u2019s not we will be looking to continue to spend and build additional capabilities there as we go forward.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Jones. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Rhyee, your line is open. Are you on mute? Moving on to our next question, it\u2019s from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Good morning. Just had a question on the Prime Therapeutics opportunity and maybe if you could help us to frame that as far as like what\u2019s the further penetration into the existing relationship? How could penetration improve as you kind of do direct relationships or subsequent relationships with other blues? And then their sell-through so they get carved out less, how does that improve really the Prime penetration opportunity? And then maybe just as a clarification, you mentioned decreased specialty contribution in the prepared remarks, if you could just maybe clarify what that meant as well? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Lance, good morning. It\u2019s David. I will take the first part of your question. I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. I think to frame the first part of your question broadly is, first and foremost, we need to earn the right to serve clients each and every day. We were fortunate to be selected to be a partner with Prime as we set up the opportunity earlier this year, began servicing them in April and those service offerings are working quite well. That positioned us and was -- reinforced with our commitment with Evernorth to expand those services and we will have the ability to grow at a choice based on the Prime participants as they so choose relative to our specialty pharmacy and alike. It allows us to have an opportunity to mutually grow together. Your point relative to the sell-through and otherwise, our team is focused on strengthening the value proposition of Prime and of the Prime members -- member plans to have more value offered to their customers and grow their portfolio businesses, full stop. That is the commitment of the team supporting the Prime relationship, and therefore, it should allow for us to continue to grow off of the existing platform. It should allow for us to continue to grow as the Prime representation grows and it should allow us to continue to grow, as to your point, their sell-through has more traction on a go-forward basis and our business model is designed to do so. So stay tuned for more. But the positioning that we have today we really love, because now we will be able to leverage our high performing specialty portfolio, as well as our very strong and well-performing a mail order pharmacy services operation for their benefit. Eric?\nEric Palmer: Yeah. On the specialty contribution, Lance, to the comments that I made around specialty contributions here refers to the portfolio of specialty capabilities we have benefits overall. So things like health, behavioral, disease management, care management, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This has been a core part of our go-to-market approach for some time and a high performing business. And as you know, we did call out, a bit lower contribution from these products in the quarter. And as you think about a couple of items here, one, as an example, we have seen significant increases in behavioral costs in 2020 in the third quarter in particular. Utilization there above our prior expectation as we have seen stresses and anxiety take a toll just on the mental health of the nation at large, one. And then, two, the impact our volumes, right? So as we had a little bit of lower volume that comes through this business as well. But those would be the items that I\u2019d refer to you in terms of specialty contributions.\nLance Wilkes: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question is from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Your line is open, ma\u2019am.\nSarah James: Thank you. I was looking back at the transcript of the second quarter and I know at that time we talked about you not seeing a slowdown in claims receipt as of July 30, but then today you are talking about 100 basis points of 3Q MLR being related to June. So it sounds like there\u2019s a slowdown in claims receipt in June that maybe wasn\u2019t there in April or May. I am wondering, as a result of that, did you change your assumptions in completion factor for how you reported 3Q and for what percent of claims comes 60 days out or greater? And was there any impact on how you think about reserves or DCP as a result of that? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Hi, Sarah. It\u2019s Eric. So on the -- good memory, I remember your question from the last call as well on that front, and I would still say, we haven\u2019t seen a change in speed of submission or anything along those lines from a claims perspective. Now the month of June, as I noted in response to one of the other questions and in my prepared remarks that, the most recent month we estimate really based more off of our estimation of activity, not so much extrapolating from kind of the claims that have been received yet or anything along those lines. So, and as I noted, all else equal, we would have exited the month of June now a bit higher than what we did a quarter ago. But think of that as pretty isolated in terms of the impact. As we now have looked at the development of June and looked at our experience in July, August, September even if the emerging experience from October seem quite consistent in terms of the return to normal, the levels of utilization, levels of speed of processing, et cetera. And if you look at our day claims payable metric, well, that metric is not perfect, I mean, you see actually a pretty good degree of consistency in terms of the basically entail the metric for where we sit here at the end of third quarter 2020 compared with prior third quarters or things along those lines. So, at a macro level, quite comfortable that we have got the right estimates and such year, and the estimation of claims and the overall speed of utilization, et cetera.\nSarah James: I guess just to be more specific, when you 3Q MLR, did you assume whatever factor in June that that you are seeing now continued through 3Q MLR. So whether that\u2019s a slowdown or ends up being conservatism and swings the other way with positive development, but did you hold that consistent and so you placed though by month?\nEric Palmer: Yeah. So we placed through -- yeah. So we placed through the assumptions consistently by month. So, again, just to unpack that a bit further, we had estimated the month of June, I made some comments a quarter ago about June being closer back to normal levels of utilization with the benefit of hindsight, it was much closer to normal. So, previously, think about that as having been the single-digit closer to kind of a zero level of variation from utilization and we placed those types of assumptions all the way through in terms of each of our estimates for the month since then. So, again, we would think that the June impact was isolated to the month of June.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Ms. James. Our next question is from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nStephen Tanal: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, David, I hope to follow-up in your comments in the commercial market and clarify the point about enrollment into 2021, maybe tie that back to the selling season for group accounts. I think I heard national accounts enrollment might be down 20%, 21%, but offset by Select and middle market growth. I just wanted to clarify that? And also wondering if you could elaborate on your comment in the actions employers are taking in response to the pandemic as it relates to this business. Are you seeing benefit buy down there, what kind of innovation that you mentioned is resonating with employers into 2021, maybe if you could give us a sense for how pricing is going in the group insured side as well that would be helpful?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. Let me take it in reverse order. So specific to employer actions, obviously, unique to each employer, but if we step back and talk about a few of the general trends. First and foremost, the press for improved affordability and value transcends buyers of all shapes and sizes. And through our both prepared remarks and our dialogue today, we continue to reinforce the actions we are taking relative to further improvement of affordability and value trend deflection in the light from that standpoint and our results remain quite strong relative to that. Beyond that, employers are both reaching. So expanding services of a self-funded employer determines, are they going to waive the cost responsibility for individuals around testing, around treatment from that standpoint, example one. Two, are they going to expand services for telehealth or virtual service fulfillment at little to no cost from that standpoint? Many employers have expanded those services. Third, pressing, as Eric articulated before to recognize that the behavioral challenges that had been ramping from a societal standpoint, as we have been oriented around mind and body, have stepped up to another threshold level. So, reaching for identifying additional, we will call it, behavior health and wellbeing services to help to deal with beyond the core of what mental health services are dealing with around stress or on anxiety, around resiliency, around loneliness from that standpoint. So we are seeing employers step into a whole variety of actions and press from an innovation standpoint, press themselves from a care delivery standpoint, et cetera, before we get to the decisions they make when they decide to furlough somebody versus lay them off to try to have continuity of benefits for the benefit of those individuals. Back to the comments relative to the selling season, I must try to provide a little bit of direction there so I punch it up a little bit, but we will go through the appropriate detail on the fourth quarter call. What I indicated is as we look at the overall commercial medical customer environment. First and foremost, our results through three-quarters of this year are strong, given the dislocations happening in the environment and our overall portfolio continues to perform well from that standpoint. Second, I indicated that as we sit here today, we would expect that the medical membership that will end the year with and we expect to see continued disenrollment pressure throughout the course of this year. The medical membership that will end this year with will be about the same medical membership we will have on January 1 plus or minus. There\u2019s puts and takes there. There\u2019s always some lost accounts. Although, our retention outlook is quite strong. There\u2019s always some one accounts that come through from that standpoint and this enrollment will continue. The net of all that in the month of January, our estimation is that we will be about stable and that we will see some membership growth throughout the course of the year. In part, what you heard with that is the Select segment sells every month. Every month is the most important month for that segment. So we will see continued growth contributions come along relative to that. We have visibility relative to some additional growth in the mid part of the year, and then ultimately, we are expecting that the disenrollment pressure in 2021 will continue at a minimum throughout the first half plus of 2021. So I hope that color helps you kind of shape both what we are seeing in terms of the buying environment as well as what we are seeing relative to our outlook.\nStephen Tanal: Helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Tanal. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, Mr. Hill.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys. And this is actually a bit of a follow up on Steve\u2019s question, which is kind of given the rapid growth of telemedicine and all these digitally enabled solutions that we have seen come to market over the last year. So, could you talk about the demand this selling season for the digital formulary solution and the Embarc specialty insurance product? And I guess how far away do we think they are from being meaningful contributors to the Evernorth segment?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It\u2019s David. So as we step back to think about there\u2019s two different examples to use the digital formulary and Embarc, but embedded in the first part of your comment. As we look at what the COVID environment has done, it\u2019s probably jumped multiple years of adoption relative to additional services from that standpoint. Not unique to our industry but specific to our industry, as we take telehealth and as we take the kind of re-envisioning what can be fulfilled in the home, both safely and a highly personalized way in a more affordable way, leveraging technology in a different way. So we see, what we call, virtual care, so taking telehealth a little bit more broadly in a more comprehensive way as a market trend that will not reverse itself, where we will see some both tremendous adoption growth, and importantly, value for individuals not just from an affordability standpoint, but from a personalization standpoint through that lens and there are a variety of issues, we have both through partner relationships, we have organic initiatives we have and alike. Specific to digital formulary, Embarc, I would not ask you to think about any one launch within our portfolio as the launch or the silver bullet. Rather, we are really proud of the fact that even over the first two years as a combined corporation, we have had a consistent drumbeat of new innovations and new offerings that we have been able to bring to market for the benefit of our existing and prospective clients that we are able to serve through that through the Evernorth framework and there\u2019s a dedicated innovation infrastructure and body resources there. So, the digital formulary has had very good receptivity. Embarc, Embarc is a little bit of a different value proposition, where it\u2019s client-by-client opportunities, but it also is indicative of us changing the narrative, trying to take a problem statement that societies said is unsolvable relative to the high cost game changing super specialty drugs from that standpoint and trying to turn it into a more affordable, predictable simplified offering and you should expect us to bring more offerings akin to that to the marketplace. So we see those as positive contributors, indications of also our conviction relative to innovation and conviction relative to value delivery, and it\u2019s contributing to our revenue growth chassis.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ma\u2019am, your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Biosimilars was highlighted as a growth driver this quarter and some of the supply chain costs. When you think about the impact of biosimilars on Express in the quarter, have you seen any outsized benefit? And also just how do you think about biosimilars positioning within formularies versus innovator products?\nEric Palmer: Yeah. Ricky, it\u2019s Eric. I will start. So, in terms of calling anything out in the quarter, I really wouldn\u2019t note any particular impact. I think the potential here is meaningful in the future. So quite excited about the future opportunity as there are more therapies and treatments in the market and things along those lines, but I wouldn\u2019t call out anything related to the third quarter in terms of notable impact.\nDavid Cordani: Ricky, picking up on an Eric\u2019s point, I agree with his statements instead picking up on the opportunity. As we think about biosimilars fallout from a U.S. societal dimension, it represents a tremendous opportunity. And while it is grounded in supply chain it\u2019s by no means limited to supply chain, because the biosimilar dimension, you need to have deep and broad political acumen, both in the pharmaceutical arena, but then the additional reach within the practicing physicians to ensure that the decisions made one patient at a time are grounded in the appropriate clinical orientation. And as a combined corporation now we not only have the supply chain infrastructure and the deep and well performing pharmacy clinical infrastructure, but we have deep medical relationships through value based care underlying relationships that positions us quite well. And we are excited to get on with biosimilar adoption rate, where the U.S., if we are honest with ourselves lags, some other countries relative to the approval rate and from an affordability and value standpoint, we need to get on with it and we are well-positioned as a combined corporation to deliver great value there.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Ms. Goldwasser. Our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open, sir.\nCharles Rhyee: Hi. Can you guys hear me?\nDavid Cordani: Yes. We can.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And just maybe a two-part question here. First, on vaccines, with the potential COVID vaccine coming, can you talk about sort of the how that kind of impacts the company both positive from -- I guess, a revenue standpoint and a cost standpoint? And talk about sort of what -- how pricing and reimbursement, as you understand it, maybe at this point I know it\u2019s very early -- could happen because I understand the government has bought a first big tranche of vaccine. How do you understand the distribution of that to work particularly as we think maybe more from the Evernorth side? And then, secondly, related to that, I think, yesterday Biogen had a very positive ad com meeting for their new Alzheimer\u2019s drug. Again, maybe if you could, Dave, walk through how we -- or Eric, how we should think about that impacting maybe the Evernorth business. Is that something you would expect to distribute to the Accredo brand and is this something I would fall into the Embarc program as well? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It\u2019s David. So, in your first point, there is there\u2019s multiple dimensions within that. But stepping back on the vaccine, in the current configuration, we don\u2019t step into this viewing that the vaccine presents a unique revenue generation opportunity. It\u2019s a service opportunity. It will be facilitated through Evernorth for sure. The pricing, the reimbursement structure, et cetera, that will evolve will be very based on the specific vaccines that manifest themselves, as you know. Our political leadership team is highly embedded in the national dialogue relative to this including the distribution, complexity that comes along with these vaccines that our society is starting to get their arms around relative to more than one dose, the continuity that needs to transpire, how society will be kind of prioritized from medical professionals through first responders, to high-risk individuals, et cetera. And we are well configured as a large service provider to be in support of and in service to that initiative and we look forward relative to that. Our team is taking prudent estimates relative to what we think the cost of the vaccines would be relative to 2021 outlook as well through that lens. As relates to the Alzheimer\u2019s drug, I think, it\u2019s another good example of ongoing innovation where as we hit the pause button for a moment and recognize that the vast majority of innovation in the present environment and as we extrapolate forward around healthcare innovation is and will continue to transpire pharmaceutically, right? The chapter is evolving on an accelerated basis that clinical innovation globally will be heavily pharmaceutically oriented from that standpoint. And the Alzheimer drug, which is quite exciting from a societal standpoint, is also extremely complex and costly. Hence having market leading specialty pharmacy capability per Accredo position does quite well and to your last point, presents additional opportunities to potentially expand the Embarc program, which we would suggest would transpire over time. So I think it\u2019s a good concrete example of what the future has in store relative to very exciting and life-changing drugs, but also highly complex and costly and having the capabilities to be able to serve and support that, whether who the Alzheimer drug you just questioned or previously Ricky questioned relative to biosimilars going the other way, our Evernorth portfolio is really well-positioned to be able to create great value for society here.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Rhyee. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you. So as we wrap up here, I\u2019d like to first and foremost acknowledge Cigna\u2019s more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who again have worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic in support of those we are able to serve around the world, customers, patients and clients. Our mission at Cigna to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important and continues to guide all the actions. Specific to Evernorth, it represents an exciting new chapter for our company and along with our other growth platforms, we seek to leverage our broad suite of capabilities to create innovative and flexible solutions to tackle some of society\u2019s toughest healthcare issues and drive sustained growth. From a results perspective, we once again deliver strong results this quarter and remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna Express Scripts by the end of this calendar year. We are also well-positioned to deliver very strong revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 per share to $21 per share. With that, we thank you for joining our call.

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I will begin by providing a few brief comments on Tuesday's election results, which are certainly top of mind for all of us. Then, I will speak to how Cigna's strategy accelerated by our recent launch of Evernorth, positions us to continue building on our history of delivering strong performance in dynamic and rapidly evolving environments. I will also provide comments on our strong third quarter results and I will conclude a few brief overview comments relative to 2021 before turning the call over to Eric. First, relative to the election. Certainly, we along with everybody else awaits to see a clear and orderly conclusion. Regardless of the final outcome, our mission to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of those we serve around the world has not changed and is more critical than ever. We are ready to continue engaging in critical discussions on healthcare with members of both sides of the aisle at federal, state and local levels. And we look forward to working constructively with the current administration or a new administration as we have been privileged to do so in the past. Looking forward, the long-term health needs of individuals and society at large transcends the results of any particular election or political climate. There is no question that simply continuing with the status quo for healthcare is not sufficient under any circumstances. Take for example that today's children are likely to be the first generation in American history to live shorter lives than their parents. Clearly, this is unacceptable. And the COVID-19 crisis has only reinforced our unsustainable healthcare challenges, including eroding individual health status, increased mental health impacts from heightened stress, anxiety and loneliness, health disparities and social determinants of health, and gaps in our healthcare delivery infrastructure. Many U.S. states are seeing their healthcare systems overwhelmed and only exacerbated by the underlying chronic conditions such as diabetes that increase the risk of severe complications from COVID-19. The bottomline is that there is no one healthcare system that is perfectly positioned. In our view, the conversation regarding healthcare must focus less on who pays the cost of an unsustainable system. In fact, systems around the world continue to struggle with unsustainability and rising costs including nationalized systems. What is important is that we work together to find solutions to meet the diverse underlying needs that are unique to a population in the most effective way possible. Regardless of the political climate, more than ever, people, governments and employers, as well as health plans are looking for healthcare systems that focus on keeping people healthy and not just treating them when they are sick, caring for the whole person, both mind and body and ensuring the most affordable, high value delivery of healthcare services. At Cigna, we are delivering on this promise and our strategy is designed to answer the call for healthcare system that is more affordable, predictable and simple. Our strategy guides us to customize our solutions to meet the diverse needs of our clients, our customers and our patients, and look at every decision and action we take to ensure it is addressing the demands for more value. We have amassed a targeted portfolio of capabilities to accelerate this direction and when combined with our partnership orientation, our focus on data driven innovation and capital flexibility, we are positioned to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and sustainable attractive growth. As you know, we recently introduced Evernorth, an evolution of our high performing health service portfolio and another important milestone in delivering on our strategy. With Evernorth, we have a distinct and dedicated platform of services and innovative healthcare solutions for health plans, employers, government organizations and healthcare providers. The launch of this new brand in September was met with overwhelming support and excitement from these viral groups. Through this dedicated platform we were demonstrating our commitment to meet their unique needs and invest in their success. Additionally, the platform further reinforces our position as the partner of choice to create more shared value for our clients and open their customers. A recent example of this is our growing partnership with Prime Therapeutics. Through our Prime relationship, we expand our retail pharmacy network and rebate administration services to more Americans through their 23 Blue Cross/Blue Shield Plans. We achieve this by enhancing the retail pharmacy network and increasing affordability from pharmaceutical manufacturers. With Evernorth, our relationship with Prime will be further expanded. This includes the option for Prime's plans to access the Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and Express Scripts' home delivery in network pharmacies beginning on January 1, 2021. Evernorth reinforces our deep commitment to leverage our broad capabilities to serve health plans, employers, government entities and healthcare professionals, and pursue mutually beneficial partnerships. At the same time, we are continuing to further invest in our Cigna brand, under which are U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International businesses go to market. We will continue be known for a customer- and client-focus approach and for delivering industry leading trends and outstanding customer service. For example, I am pleased to announce that our Medicare Advantage business achieved an annual customer Net Promoter Score of plus 74, the fourth consecutive year we have shown an increase. In addition in 2021, 88% of our customers will be in four-star plus rated plans and we are the only major plan to achieve an increase year-over-year. This is just one example and important one of our Cigna-branded companies will continue to deliver differentiated value in the marketplace. With Cigna and the recent addition of Evernorth platform, we now have two powerful brands from which to drive sustained growth today and well into the future. Now, turning to our third quarter performance. We delivered strong results that were in line with our expectations. As a result, and as expected, we experienced the return of elevated utilization to more typical levels and ongoing impact of COVID-19. We also continue to take actions to support our customers, our clients, our coworkers, our healthcare professionals and our communities in these exceptionally challenging times. Additionally, we remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna and Express Scripts by the end of this year. Our consolidated revenue was $40.8 billion with after-tax earnings of $1.6 billion. In our Evernorth segment, we continue to deliver strong performance, demonstrating the value we bring to health plans, employers and government clients. Within the U.S. Medical segment, we saw an increase in cost as expected as utilization returned to more typical levels. And our International business continues to deliver revenue and earnings growth, as we meet the needs of our global customers as they navigate the disrupted environment due to COVID-19. With our strong third quarter results, we are confident that we will achieve our updated 2020 revenue and EPS outlook. Looking forward to 2021, we have a number of tailwinds including continued growth momentum, favorable impacts from synergies from our Express Scripts combination and further administrative synergies. We expect year-over-year headwinds from increased medical costs largely driven by the ongoing impact of COVID-19. Diving a bit more deeply into our growth momentum, we expect to drive continue to organic growth across each of our well-positioned platforms. I'd specifically highlight strong growth within our pharmacy service portfolio, including specialty and underlying script growth aided by projected 98% client retention level and continued expansion of our U.S. Government business including Medicare Advantage, where we continue to drive both strong market and product expansion, as well as in-market growth, putting us on track for customer growth in our targeted range of 10% to 15% in 2021 and an individual changes where we have increased our addressable market footprint by over 50%. All-in, we are positioned for both very strong revenue and continued earnings growth in 2021, and we remain on track to achieve our strategic goal of $20 to $21 of EPS. We expect a strong operating momentum and capitalized framework to drive attractive operating cash flows of greater than $8 million. This significant cash flow generation combined with our ongoing deleveraging will give us significant strategic and financial flexibility for 2021 and beyond. Now to summarize before turning it over to Eric. Cigna has a long history of delivering strong performance in dynamic rapidly evolving environments, focused first and foremost on addressing the health and well-being needs of the individuals we serve. This approach transcends the results of any particular election cycle. We continue to build on this foundation as we delivered another strong quarter driven by the outstanding dedication of our more than 70,000 colleagues around the world who focused every day on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. Our mission and our strategy as champions were affordable, predictable and simple healthcare will continue to guide us, as we provide exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. And the launch of Evernorth will further fuel our strategy and expand our ability to serve more individuals. Finally, as we usually do, we look forward to providing more detailed and complete guidance for 2021 on our fourth quarter earnings call. With that, I will turn it over to Eric. Justin, good morning. Appreciate your question. And embedded in your question is acknowledgement of the strategic positioning of our portfolio. As you noted, we will be producing a significant -- need to produce a significant amount of cash flow that is deployable from that standpoint. From our point of view, stepping back, as noted in Eric's prepared remarks, you saw that we were pretty active in the share repurchase domain over the third quarter and saw some tremendous opportunity there. Specific to your question, as I noted, we are going to look forward to providing 2021 guidance on our fourth quarter call and you might expect that as we complete our group closure, as Eric articulated in the fourth quarter and stepping into the first quarter, we have an opportunity not just to refresh our 2021 outlook, but also to refresh our capital deployment priorities and alike off of that very strong base. So we look forward to that conversation. Andrew, good morning. It's David. Thanks for referring me to the question. So stepping back, we are delighted with our performance in 2020 for starters, and as we laid out that multiyear 10% to 15% growth objective. We also underscored the fact that we were going to systematically expand our positioning in the market from less than 20% of the addressable market in 2019 to 50% of the addressable market 2024. So we are systematically expanding our geographies and we have added a new platform in terms of individual PPO in 2020. So that continues to carry forward. As it relates to 2021, our view of -- our positioning of our offerings in the marketplace, we feel quite good about that. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we have a strong base to jump off of relative to 80% star rating and a Net Promoter Score of 74. We remain committed to that 10% to 15% range. We look forward to providing you updates as we go forward. We always strive to perform at our best. And I appreciate your optimism and make sure that the senior team knows your optimism as well relative to this, but we are excited to end 2020 with a strong year and step into 2021 with some great growth momentum and look forward to continuing that beyond 2021. So specific to inorganic opportunities, we have continued to have a portfolio of inorganic priorities. We have historically had five priorities or so that we have walked through and we previously refreshed them about a year ago at our Investor Day from that standpoint and U.S. seniors remains on that list. The underpinning growth chassis for this business is an organic growth chassis, to be clear. So we will be opportunistic and always open minded relative to inorganic opportunities. But the growth chassis here is an organic growth chassis aided by our end market growth, our platform expansion into individual PPO, our new market entry, which I referenced before, as well as over time additional employer, right, with growth from that standpoint. So it's organic first and opportunistic on an organic as appropriate in the future. A.J., good morning. It's David. So specifically relative to Evernorth, as I noted, we are quite excited to have launched that in September. We view it as a further reinforcement of an acceleration of our health service strategy. We have talked for quite some time as a business -- an evolving business portfolio of services and a health service portfolio. Specific to Evernorth, the way I'd ask you to think about it is, one, it's a further reinforcement of the dedication we have of resources for supporting large complex employer needs, health plan needs, governmental entity needs, both federal as well as state agency needs, as well as healthcare-integrated systems and healthcare providers who were taking performance based risks or value based programs around that. Within our portfolio today, we have a large well performing pharmacy services portfolio solutions, we have a benefit management solutions to bring forward to the marketplace, we have care management solutions and a growing portfolio of data and analytics solutions from that standpoint. And lastly, to your comment, we see this not only as an attractive organic growth platform and our performance reinforces that we are building from strength, but also an opportunity for tuck-in or expansion capabilities as we go forward. And illustratively from that standpoint, we continue to see the opportunity to expand services that we offer to individuals around care delivery and care coordination from that standpoint, embracing technology, embracing virtual services, expanding our home healthcare capabilities, et cetera. We are readily building some of those capabilities organically today and we will be opportunistic from an inorganic standpoint. So just an acceleration of our service portfolio, dedication of resources, reinforcing our partner of choice orientation and a very broad portfolio of services today that will continue to expand for the benefit of those we can serve. Josh, good morning. It's David. So, first, as a backdrop, as you know, we have had a long history within the Cigna portfolio of integrated offerings from employers, with a deep conviction relative to integrating those offerings with medical off of the then Cigna PBM, behavioral health, and care management services and that continues. The combination helps us further strengthen that value proposition in terms of furthering the affordability dimension of it, but also bringing some more systemic flexibility for solution design that we can bring toward middle market and larger client from that standpoint. And I would say that that continues, continued traction relative to the integrated proposition. In addition to that, our results show the underlying strength of the pharmacy services from a point solution as we think about it or a specific either PBM, PBM and specialty, or broader suite of services around that. And then through Evernorth, we see the opportunity to further expand that by coordinating, say, behavior health with pharmacy services going forward. So to the core of your question, our strength and momentum continues, the strong clinical outcomes we are delivering continues, many employer/buyers value that integrated proposition and were oriented around that within the Cigna brand, but some larger corporate buyers orient still around either an a la carte or point solution and increasingly looking for some additional leverage around that, we talked about coordinated benefits by bringing, say, pharmacy and behavioral together to coordinate those services and as a combined corporation with the Cigna brand and the Evernorth brand, we are really well-positioned to deliver for either buyer orientation. So, Kevin, good morning. It's David. First, as we get into the commercial conversation, I do want to pause for a second and recognize from what we see is just a tremendous contribution that employers are making right now in these disruptive times facing COVID. We are seeing employers of all sizes work, stretch, innovate to do everything possible to support their employees and their family members, whether those are expanded services, additional coverages relative to testing and treatment costs. And they are working tirelessly to either minimize the layoffs or when they need to transpire, doing them through furloughs and having coordination. So I do think it's important to pause there and recognize the power of that system right now and corporations of all shapes and sizes working really hard to support individuals. As it relates to membership, as Eric noted, in the big picture of a disruptive environment, we are pleased with our performance. Our portfolio tends to be well-positioned by industry sub-segment and our transparency of our programs has us highly aligned with employers. For example, through the third quarter, our employer clients because of our transparent funding mechanisms have about $3 billion less spending than they otherwise would have projected to have given the environment and the continuity of cash flow that takes place around that is quite helpful, above and beyond that we have taken some additional steps. As we look forward, we know it's a disruptive environment. We expect right now as we look at the environment that we will continue to see employer customer disruption throughout the residual part of this year and into 2021. That's factored into our outlook when we talk about 2021 in detail. Next quarter, we will try to give you more insight relative to that. We are expecting, net-net, with our new growth, as well as retention as well this enrollment, we would go from the end of this calendar year's number to the beginning 2021 with approximately stable commercial membership, as we continue selling to Select segment, continue to have some retention losses, but all within our strategic range. And then throughout the course of the year, while we expect to see some continued disenrollment pressure, our outlook relative to growth is quite positive with some known traction into 2021. We expect to see some slight growth going forward. So, all in all, in a highly disruptive environment, we are very pleased with the results were able to deliver and we are fortunate to be partnered with so many commercial clients that are putting their employees first front and center. Good morning, Ralph. So, first and foremost, relative to Prime, as I noted in the prepared remarks, we work every day to try to earn that right to be as we call it an undisputed partner of choice. It's a strategic imperative. It guides our actions and underlying that, we need to have the products, programs and services to deliver value. But we also have to have the orientation to partner and to seek mutual alignment. We are pleased with the early configuration with Prime. We established that and stood up in April of this calendar year and it's performing well. The further dedication we had around Evernorth and our performance relative to that first expansion services earned us the right, as we noted, too and the opportunity to be able to serve Prime in a more expansive basis. We will see that growth continue systematically throughout 2021. As I noted in my prepared remarks, the plans have choices. We are a choice-based framework. But the, for example, the Accredo value proposition is a tremendous value proposition and we are excited to expand that starting in January 1st for many of the Prime plans. There's investments -- there's ongoing investments we are making. That's factored in to our outlook for this year. There will be further investments we are making in the fourth quarter of this year for the tremendous underpinning of growth around that. But we are well-positioned to be able to make that happen and achieve our goals and objectives for 2020 that Eric noted in terms of our refreshed objective and as we get into the detailed 2021 guidance next quarter, we will try to give you a little bit more color. But we just see this as an ongoing expansion of a mutually beneficial relationship, where we are able to create together some tremendous value that individuals will benefit from as we expand those we are able to serve. It's David. Let me take it in reverse order. So when we step forward and put forth the CPI goal and objective, I think, it caused the market to question whether or not that was theoretical possible or otherwise. But it was a conversation that needs to be had, because we established it around an orientation that it was a symbol of sustainability, not that it was perfect, but it's a symbol of sustainability. Said otherwise, if total basket of goods costs from a societal standpoint are increasing by X, whatever X is, 2%, businesses need to find a way to approximate that to create a level of sustainability or better from that standpoint. And we are proud of the fact that we have delivered the lowest medical cost trend, and by the way the lowest pharmacy trend in our space as best anybody could tell apples-to-apples year in, year out. So that continuation is mission critical. This is a unique year, as everybody knows, relative to COVID in terms of disrupting the trend. But we continue to drive toward that. Second within the context of your question, we see many, to your term, disruptive or innovative models to drive step function improvements and we have many clients today pre-COVID that are benefiting from CPI or well better than CPI trend who are on the highly innovative dimension of consumer engagement, incentive alignment, heavy leverage and utilization of value-based care provider groups and center of excellence leverage from that standpoint, et cetera, et cetera. So, you used the word disruption, I will use the word innovation. We see the need for relentless drive relative to that, because as I noted in my prepared remarks, we can't continue to afford and no society can continue to afford paying at the levels that are being driven. The last point I'd make here is, our open-framed partner orientation has us embrace, if you will, innovators or disruptors be they care delivery systems or alike from that standpoint. So, more to follow here. I appreciate you highlighting it and we remain extremely committed to driving optimal value here. As it relates to your first point, there's a bunch of, I'd say, hypotheticals and theoreticals within that. The way I hear your first point though more broadly is, it's another example of pressing for a sustained affordability 340B was designed with a specific purpose and intent in mind. There are many hospitals and delivery system infrastructures that need 340B to make them work. It's an interesting time to have that conversation, whereby delivery system infrastructures are strained in ways we haven't seen in the past due to COVID causing massive revenue ramifications, of which governmental intervention and some player like our self and others in our space are providing support from that standpoint. So, it's an interesting time to have that theoretical conversation, but unlike most programs it will most likely evolve and our broader service portfolio is positioned to evolve with it. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. It's David. I will take the first question and I will ask Eric to address your second question. The simple answer is, no. We don't see a C change in terms of buyer behavior relative to wanting more of or less of. It's one client at a time. We have a very much of a consultative orientation trying to find the right configuration of benefits and funding mechanisms that work for clients. Now, within that, our Select segment is an integrated offering, full stop, period, the end. It's designed to be an integrated offering, whether it's on an ASO platform or a guarantee cost platform. As you move upmarket into commercial employer space within middle market and national accounts, you see different buying behaviors and it ebbs and flows. And I think the important message here is that, as an entity, we are extremely well-positioned to deliver what a client wants, whether they want a fully integrated offering, whether they want a point solution, a best-in-class PBM or best-in-class specialty pharmacy or both from that standpoint, or increasingly you are looking to get some additional value off coordination of services, be it care management services, behavior health, et cetera, relative to that. But I wouldn't say there's a C change. I would say think about Evernorth and Cigna together as being extremely well-positioned to deliver on the value that buyers want, be it integrated, point solutions if you want standalone pharmacy services in this case or evolving some coordination of services to get another step function of value that come along with that. Eric? Lance, good morning. It's David. I will take the first part of your question. I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. I think to frame the first part of your question broadly is, first and foremost, we need to earn the right to serve clients each and every day. We were fortunate to be selected to be a partner with Prime as we set up the opportunity earlier this year, began servicing them in April and those service offerings are working quite well. That positioned us and was -- reinforced with our commitment with Evernorth to expand those services and we will have the ability to grow at a choice based on the Prime participants as they so choose relative to our specialty pharmacy and alike. It allows us to have an opportunity to mutually grow together. Your point relative to the sell-through and otherwise, our team is focused on strengthening the value proposition of Prime and of the Prime members -- member plans to have more value offered to their customers and grow their portfolio businesses, full stop. That is the commitment of the team supporting the Prime relationship, and therefore, it should allow for us to continue to grow off of the existing platform. It should allow for us to continue to grow as the Prime representation grows and it should allow us to continue to grow, as to your point, their sell-through has more traction on a go-forward basis and our business model is designed to do so. So stay tuned for more. But the positioning that we have today we really love, because now we will be able to leverage our high performing specialty portfolio, as well as our very strong and well-performing a mail order pharmacy services operation for their benefit. Eric? Good morning. Let me take it in reverse order. So specific to employer actions, obviously, unique to each employer, but if we step back and talk about a few of the general trends. First and foremost, the press for improved affordability and value transcends buyers of all shapes and sizes. And through our both prepared remarks and our dialogue today, we continue to reinforce the actions we are taking relative to further improvement of affordability and value trend deflection in the light from that standpoint and our results remain quite strong relative to that. Beyond that, employers are both reaching. So expanding services of a self-funded employer determines, are they going to waive the cost responsibility for individuals around testing, around treatment from that standpoint, example one. Two, are they going to expand services for telehealth or virtual service fulfillment at little to no cost from that standpoint? Many employers have expanded those services. Third, pressing, as Eric articulated before to recognize that the behavioral challenges that had been ramping from a societal standpoint, as we have been oriented around mind and body, have stepped up to another threshold level. So, reaching for identifying additional, we will call it, behavior health and wellbeing services to help to deal with beyond the core of what mental health services are dealing with around stress or on anxiety, around resiliency, around loneliness from that standpoint. So we are seeing employers step into a whole variety of actions and press from an innovation standpoint, press themselves from a care delivery standpoint, et cetera, before we get to the decisions they make when they decide to furlough somebody versus lay them off to try to have continuity of benefits for the benefit of those individuals. Back to the comments relative to the selling season, I must try to provide a little bit of direction there so I punch it up a little bit, but we will go through the appropriate detail on the fourth quarter call. What I indicated is as we look at the overall commercial medical customer environment. First and foremost, our results through three-quarters of this year are strong, given the dislocations happening in the environment and our overall portfolio continues to perform well from that standpoint. Second, I indicated that as we sit here today, we would expect that the medical membership that will end the year with and we expect to see continued disenrollment pressure throughout the course of this year. The medical membership that will end this year with will be about the same medical membership we will have on January 1 plus or minus. There's puts and takes there. There's always some lost accounts. Although, our retention outlook is quite strong. There's always some one accounts that come through from that standpoint and this enrollment will continue. The net of all that in the month of January, our estimation is that we will be about stable and that we will see some membership growth throughout the course of the year. In part, what you heard with that is the Select segment sells every month. Every month is the most important month for that segment. So we will see continued growth contributions come along relative to that. We have visibility relative to some additional growth in the mid part of the year, and then ultimately, we are expecting that the disenrollment pressure in 2021 will continue at a minimum throughout the first half plus of 2021. So I hope that color helps you kind of shape both what we are seeing in terms of the buying environment as well as what we are seeing relative to our outlook. Good morning. It's David. So as we step back to think about there's two different examples to use the digital formulary and Embarc, but embedded in the first part of your comment. As we look at what the COVID environment has done, it's probably jumped multiple years of adoption relative to additional services from that standpoint. Not unique to our industry but specific to our industry, as we take telehealth and as we take the kind of re-envisioning what can be fulfilled in the home, both safely and a highly personalized way in a more affordable way, leveraging technology in a different way. So we see, what we call, virtual care, so taking telehealth a little bit more broadly in a more comprehensive way as a market trend that will not reverse itself, where we will see some both tremendous adoption growth, and importantly, value for individuals not just from an affordability standpoint, but from a personalization standpoint through that lens and there are a variety of issues, we have both through partner relationships, we have organic initiatives we have and alike. Specific to digital formulary, Embarc, I would not ask you to think about any one launch within our portfolio as the launch or the silver bullet. Rather, we are really proud of the fact that even over the first two years as a combined corporation, we have had a consistent drumbeat of new innovations and new offerings that we have been able to bring to market for the benefit of our existing and prospective clients that we are able to serve through that through the Evernorth framework and there's a dedicated innovation infrastructure and body resources there. So, the digital formulary has had very good receptivity. Embarc, Embarc is a little bit of a different value proposition, where it's client-by-client opportunities, but it also is indicative of us changing the narrative, trying to take a problem statement that societies said is unsolvable relative to the high cost game changing super specialty drugs from that standpoint and trying to turn it into a more affordable, predictable simplified offering and you should expect us to bring more offerings akin to that to the marketplace. So we see those as positive contributors, indications of also our conviction relative to innovation and conviction relative to value delivery, and it's contributing to our revenue growth chassis. Ricky, picking up on an Eric's point, I agree with his statements instead picking up on the opportunity. As we think about biosimilars fallout from a U.S. societal dimension, it represents a tremendous opportunity. And while it is grounded in supply chain it's by no means limited to supply chain, because the biosimilar dimension, you need to have deep and broad political acumen, both in the pharmaceutical arena, but then the additional reach within the practicing physicians to ensure that the decisions made one patient at a time are grounded in the appropriate clinical orientation. And as a combined corporation now we not only have the supply chain infrastructure and the deep and well performing pharmacy clinical infrastructure, but we have deep medical relationships through value based care underlying relationships that positions us quite well. And we are excited to get on with biosimilar adoption rate, where the U.S., if we are honest with ourselves lags, some other countries relative to the approval rate and from an affordability and value standpoint, we need to get on with it and we are well-positioned as a combined corporation to deliver great value there. Yes. We can. Good morning. It's David. So, in your first point, there is there's multiple dimensions within that. But stepping back on the vaccine, in the current configuration, we don't step into this viewing that the vaccine presents a unique revenue generation opportunity. It's a service opportunity. It will be facilitated through Evernorth for sure. The pricing, the reimbursement structure, et cetera, that will evolve will be very based on the specific vaccines that manifest themselves, as you know. Our political leadership team is highly embedded in the national dialogue relative to this including the distribution, complexity that comes along with these vaccines that our society is starting to get their arms around relative to more than one dose, the continuity that needs to transpire, how society will be kind of prioritized from medical professionals through first responders, to high-risk individuals, et cetera. And we are well configured as a large service provider to be in support of and in service to that initiative and we look forward relative to that. Our team is taking prudent estimates relative to what we think the cost of the vaccines would be relative to 2021 outlook as well through that lens. As relates to the Alzheimer's drug, I think, it's another good example of ongoing innovation where as we hit the pause button for a moment and recognize that the vast majority of innovation in the present environment and as we extrapolate forward around healthcare innovation is and will continue to transpire pharmaceutically, right? The chapter is evolving on an accelerated basis that clinical innovation globally will be heavily pharmaceutically oriented from that standpoint. And the Alzheimer drug, which is quite exciting from a societal standpoint, is also extremely complex and costly. Hence having market leading specialty pharmacy capability per Accredo position does quite well and to your last point, presents additional opportunities to potentially expand the Embarc program, which we would suggest would transpire over time. So I think it's a good concrete example of what the future has in store relative to very exciting and life-changing drugs, but also highly complex and costly and having the capabilities to be able to serve and support that, whether who the Alzheimer drug you just questioned or previously Ricky questioned relative to biosimilars going the other way, our Evernorth portfolio is really well-positioned to be able to create great value for society here. Thank you. So as we wrap up here, I'd like to first and foremost acknowledge Cigna's more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who again have worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic in support of those we are able to serve around the world, customers, patients and clients. Our mission at Cigna to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important and continues to guide all the actions. Specific to Evernorth, it represents an exciting new chapter for our company and along with our other growth platforms, we seek to leverage our broad suite of capabilities to create innovative and flexible solutions to tackle some of society's toughest healthcare issues and drive sustained growth. From a results perspective, we once again deliver strong results this quarter and remain on track to complete the integration of Cigna Express Scripts by the end of this calendar year. We are also well-positioned to deliver very strong revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 per share to $21 per share. With that, we thank you for joining our call. Hope everybody remains healthy and safe in these trying times. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter results including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter of 2020 include, adjusted revenues of $40.8 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.41. Our results this quarter and year-to-date reflects focused execution across our businesses in a dynamic rapidly evolving environment. Regarding our segments, I will first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter adjusted revenues grew to $30 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.4 billion. As previously discussed, in Evernorth, the cadence of quarterly earnings is more typical in 2020 than in 2019, where earnings were more weighted to the second half of the year due to the timing of certain supply chain initiatives. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth and customers and script volumes, the effective execution of supply chain initiatives and continued performance and expansion of specialty pharmacy services through Accredo, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy. We fulfilled 381 million adjusted pharmacy scripts, a 22% increase over the third quarter of 2019. Overall, Evernorth continued its positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to our U.S. Medical segment. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $9.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $757 million. These results reflect unfavorable prior period development, primarily related to the second quarter of 2020, COVID-19-related impacts and the return of the health insurance tax. COVID-19 related impacts include the return of medical utilization to more typical levels, the direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment, decreased especially contributions and lower net investment income. It also reflects the actions we have taken throughout the year to support our stakeholders in this disruptive environment. For all customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment. For our Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans customers, we continue to waive cost sharing for in-office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. For clients, we have provided premium relief programs and for our providers, we have implemented a variety of financial assistance programs. I am proud of the way that we at Cigna continue to respond to the pandemic in support of our stakeholders. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with $17 million global medical customers, less than a 1% decline sequentially. Our U.S. commercial book of business remains resilient due to the industry mix of our clients and continued commitments that employers are making to the health and wellbeing of their employees through COVID. We also continue to see growth in Medicare Advantage, where we have grown membership 18% through the end of the third quarter and we also continue to grow in the Select segment. Overall, with the exception of the unfavorable prior period development, results in our U.S. Medical segment are in line with our expectations. Turning to our International markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $208 million, reflecting continued operational efficiency, lower claims due to COVID-19 and ongoing business growth. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Third quarter adjusted pretax earnings for the segment were $70 million, reflecting elevated life claims due to the pandemic. For our Corporate segment, the third quarter of 2020 loss of $356 million reflects lower interest expenses due to the lower levels of outstanding debt. Overall, as a result of focused execution in a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results. Now, looking forward to our outlook for full year 2020. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our portfolio of businesses. We expect medical utilization to remain at more typical levels with continued direct costs of COVID-19 testing and treatment and we expect some increase in commercial disenrollment due to continued dislocation in the broader labor market. In the fourth quarter, we will also continue to make investments to support our clients, customers and employees in this disrupted environment. And taken as a whole, we now expect full year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues of approximately $158 billion and we now expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18.30 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the fourth quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management and the effective deployment of capital. Now moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, third quarter cash flows from operations of $895 million, reflect the additional third quarter tax payments of approximately $826 million that was delayed from the second quarter as permitted under the CARES Act, as well as the payment of $445 million for the health insurance tax for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter, cash flows from operations were $6 billion, and for 2020, we now expect cash flows from operations of greater than $8 billion. Our businesses generated substantial amount of cash flow and in combination with $5.3 billion in net proceeds expected from the sale of our Group Disability and Life business, we have significant capital and financial flexibility. Through the end of the third quarter, we deployed $1.7 billion to debt repayment and our debt to capitalization ratio of 42.8% as of September 30th is improved from 45.2% in December 31, 2019. We are at $1.2 billion of cash available at the parents at the end of the third quarter, and on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $16 million shares of stock for $2.9 billion. Following the close of the group transaction, free cash available to the parents is expected to be at least $7 billion and we expect to deploy $4 billion to $5 billion to return our debt to capitalization ratio below 40%. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, our third quarter consolidated results reflect focused execution across our businesses and the dynamic rapidly evolving environment with particular strength the momentum in our Evernorth segment. We are well positioned to meet the financial targets we have established for 2020, all while continuing to support our clients, customers and employees, and as such, we now expect 2020 full year adjusted EPS of $18.30 per share to $18.60 per share and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, we will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Thanks, Justin. Good morning. So I will start with the reserve development piece first. So stepping back here about, just to remind you, as we look back to the second quarter, we had significantly lower utilization in April and May, and as we close out the second quarter we had to make estimates around the claims associated with the month of June. Now with the benefit of hindsight, utilization in the month of June came back a little bit faster than we previously estimated. So the way I'd have you think about this Justin is we recorded about 1 point in the loss ratio in the third quarter that really should have been back in the second quarter. So, again, think about 100 basis points on the loss ratio in this third quarter results relating to in-year reserve development that's associated with the second quarter. That's the headline in terms of the reserve development. As you think about the thesis, I would point that primarily to the Commercial business in terms of the line of business, et cetera. In terms of the deal close, to go to that part of your question, we are on track for closing in the fourth quarter. We have put out a release a couple of -- in September, so a handful of weeks to go now, nothing that we had 55 out of the 65 required regulatory approvals. We now have 63 of the 65 required regulatory approval, so we are right at the cusp of getting that transaction closed and going from there. I will let David take the kind of forward-looking comments in terms of capital deployment and the like. Hi, Gary. It's Eric. So on the first one, just to be clear, yes, we are reaffirming the $20 to $21 target and I don't think there's any ambiguity on that. That's been a target we have had for some time and we continue to be on track for that. So, again, I think the short answer to that question is, yes. On the experience-rated business, so as customers, as our clients have different levels of utilization and if there are favorable utilization, we accrue for that in the period. So, I would not think about there being any future headwinds here. Many kind of the dynamics associated with lower utilization are already reflected in the results and in the current period. So I would not think about that as a headwind in the future. Matt, it's Eric. Good morning. So, with respect to the component pieces, I touched on it a little bit on my prepared remarks, but to unpack the components. I would have you think about putting COVID aside, utilization being slightly below kind of what we would have said would be normal. So call it 95%-ish for the third quarter in terms of kind of normal levels of utilization. When you add on top of that the impact of testing and treatment for COVID and on top of that the additional actions that we have taken to reduce barriers or reduce cost sharing and to ensure our customers have access to the care, that puts you all together a little bit above the normal. And you might remember, in the second quarter, we had set an expectation that the loss ratio for the second half of this year would be elevated relative to what you otherwise might call it a normal loss ratio. So when you put those pieces together, those are that big building blocks. The only other thing I note is, it really does vary by geography. So as we have had the COVID play in and out of different geographies that kind of move things up and down and such. But, again, when you roll it all up together in aggregate, it would be consistent with what I just described. Yeah. Scott, it's Eric. Good morning. So I would not call out any particular initiative or program. I think about the opportunity here as really being much more in our continued ongoing drive for improving affordability of our services overall. I mean, just think about things like leveraging technology, improving the efficiency, automation, et cetera, of all the different processes throughout the organization. But, I think, again, it's just part of the culture of us continuing to create efficiencies versus any particular program. Yeah. On the G&A ratio, in particular, there's just a couple of things I call out here. At the most macro level, we do continue to spend and continue to invest in building additional capabilities in this business and you see that in the G&A. There are a couple of other impacts that caused it as well. One, as you might remember, we talked a bit in the past, after the close of the acquisition, just kind of rebuilding of the amortization. So the amortization on the assets you acquired gets reset and then we have to rebuild that expense into that -- have built over the -- up over time. Offsetting that is us continuing to work to find synergies and find additional efficiencies. So, again, those would be the biggest buckets that play into that ratio in any given quarter. But it's not we will be looking to continue to spend and build additional capabilities there as we go forward. Yeah. On the specialty contribution, Lance, to the comments that I made around specialty contributions here refers to the portfolio of specialty capabilities we have benefits overall. So things like health, behavioral, disease management, care management, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This has been a core part of our go-to-market approach for some time and a high performing business. And as you know, we did call out, a bit lower contribution from these products in the quarter. And as you think about a couple of items here, one, as an example, we have seen significant increases in behavioral costs in 2020 in the third quarter in particular. Utilization there above our prior expectation as we have seen stresses and anxiety take a toll just on the mental health of the nation at large, one. And then, two, the impact our volumes, right? So as we had a little bit of lower volume that comes through this business as well. But those would be the items that I'd refer to you in terms of specialty contributions. Hi, Sarah. It's Eric. So on the -- good memory, I remember your question from the last call as well on that front, and I would still say, we haven't seen a change in speed of submission or anything along those lines from a claims perspective. Now the month of June, as I noted in response to one of the other questions and in my prepared remarks that, the most recent month we estimate really based more off of our estimation of activity, not so much extrapolating from kind of the claims that have been received yet or anything along those lines. So, and as I noted, all else equal, we would have exited the month of June now a bit higher than what we did a quarter ago. But think of that as pretty isolated in terms of the impact. As we now have looked at the development of June and looked at our experience in July, August, September even if the emerging experience from October seem quite consistent in terms of the return to normal, the levels of utilization, levels of speed of processing, et cetera. And if you look at our day claims payable metric, well, that metric is not perfect, I mean, you see actually a pretty good degree of consistency in terms of the basically entail the metric for where we sit here at the end of third quarter 2020 compared with prior third quarters or things along those lines. So, at a macro level, quite comfortable that we have got the right estimates and such year, and the estimation of claims and the overall speed of utilization, et cetera. Yeah. So we placed through -- yeah. So we placed through the assumptions consistently by month. So, again, just to unpack that a bit further, we had estimated the month of June, I made some comments a quarter ago about June being closer back to normal levels of utilization with the benefit of hindsight, it was much closer to normal. So, previously, think about that as having been the single-digit closer to kind of a zero level of variation from utilization and we placed those types of assumptions all the way through in terms of each of our estimates for the month since then. So, again, we would think that the June impact was isolated to the month of June. Yeah. Ricky, it's Eric. I will start. So, in terms of calling anything out in the quarter, I really wouldn't note any particular impact. I think the potential here is meaningful in the future. So quite excited about the future opportunity as there are more therapies and treatments in the market and things along those lines, but I wouldn't call out anything related to the third quarter in terms of notable impact."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Will McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.\nWill McDowell: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter we recorded an after tax special item charge of $99 million or $0.27 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded a special item charge of $11 million after tax, or $0.03 per share for cost associated with the early extinguishment of debt. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Also, as we previously noted, prior year development is now disclosed on a gross basis, consistent with industry practice. Our financial supplement now includes a go-forward of year-to-date unpaid medical claims liability for the six months ended June 30, 2020, and 2019, as well for full-year 2019. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full-year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases. Finally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full-year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The current environment that we all live in and work in is more dynamic, more unsettled, and more complex than any time in recent history, and Cigna's mission to improve the health, wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and it continues to guide the actions as we move forward. In recent weeks and months, we have taken decisive steps to support employers who are the driving force of a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to support our communities, customers, and patients, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we view as a critical health issue as a well. Today, I'll offer several recent examples of how we continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and with our key stakeholders by delivering on our promises and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable, and simple by creating innovative solutions to solve for healthcare's most complex challenges and by partnering with our clients, some of whom are viewed as competitors, but who we see as strategic partners capable of extending our reach to making even greater impact for customers around the globe. We view all of this with the goal of maintaining and improving the health and vibrancy of our clients, communities, and customers. I will also give you an update on our financial results that we delivered for the quarter, and how these results provide a further testament to the strength of our businesses and the value we create for our customers and clients, as well as a few comments on our growth path forward, and then, I will conclude with a brief update on our outlook before turning the call over to Eric. Cigna's longstanding commitment to our clients, communities, and customers is fundamental to who we are as a global health service company, and it has been critical in shaping our ongoing response to COVID-19 crisis. This response begins with our more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic. They wake up each and every day with the sole focus to serve the needs of our customers, patients, and clients around the globe, and I am proud to be teamed up with such a talented group of co-workers, and I thank them for what they do to positively impact millions of lives each and every day. Nowhere is their commitment more evident than in their deep support of our employer clients; large, small, public, private. These businesses have always been critical to a robust economy, and today more than ever companies will play an essential role in serving individuals, reenergizing their communities and returning economies around the world to economic vibrancy. From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, Cigna's leverage of breadth of solution, strength of our team, and a consultative approach in our broad data and analytical capabilities to support our employer clients and their employees in numerous ways from taking rapid and decisive steps to eliminate cost as a barrier to testing and treatment, to expanding to access to care, to helping them safely work to return their employees to worksites, most recently, for example, with the launch of our COVID-19 high risk dashboard. This new suite of innovative analytical tools combines the power of data, predictive models, and clinical expertise to help clients project how COVID-19 might impact the health and safety of their employee populations, and to model forward impacts of different pandemic scenarios going forward. For example, the dashboard compiles and analyzes COVID-19 case data on the health of that client-specific employees at national, state, and county levels, giving them essential insights to guide their decision-making for bringing employees back to work safely. In cases, where employers see concerning trends in the reports, Cigna is prepared to help them take action. For instance, through routes like COVID-19 testing and triage services delivered from on our Cigna onsite health solutions. Our COVID-19 high risk taskforce represents just one powerful example of how Cigna is helping employers navigate the complexities of the pandemic, and serves as a reinforcement of why employers rank Cigna highest amongst its competitors for driving healthcare quality and value as reported in a recent study conducted by The Leapfrog Group, an independent national organization representing employers. Turning to our support of communities where we live, work, and play each and every day, our commitment is reflected in our efforts to increase understanding of the impacts of, and to drive positive changes to combat systemic racism, and only is systemic racism an issue of human rights, we also view it as a critical health issue, contributing to well-documented disparities in health treatment and outcomes that disproportionately impact communities of color. Two weeks ago, we launched our new five-year initiative, our building equity and equality program, which commits a mix of local community grants, scholarship funds, and employee volunteer hours to continue to drive Cigna's efforts to eliminate racism, bias, and health and economic disparities for people of color. This new initiative is another important part of Cigna's ongoing commitment to partner with our communities and government leaders to effect positive sustainable change, and we will continue to expand and evolve our engagement programs going forward. All of Cigna's efforts to partner with our clients and communities is ultimately rooted in our mission to improve the health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve, specifically focused on customers and patients. Today, more than ever, they are looking for us to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We continue to introduce new innovative programs and solutions designed to deliver on this promise. For example, our Customer Protection Program, which safeguards our customers from unexpected costs from COVID-19 through surprise or balance bills from out-of-network providers. In addition, our pharmacy solutions leverage existing and newly-created tools to put resources and medicines and treatments in the hands of those who need the most. For example, we help Americans who lose their prescription coverage from recent job loss to secure their medications at affordable predictable prices through our Express Scripts Parachute Pharmacy Program. Further, as demonstrated by our most recent drug term report, we also delivered affordability and predictability to our health service customers and clients, who in 2019, experienced an overall rate of increase of drug spending of just 2.3%, a result that is in line with the Consumer Price Index, and important to note, more than one-third of our commercial plans experienced a decrease in overall spending in 2019. Taken altogether these examples I've shared with you today are reflective of how Cigna is and will continue to deliver on our promises, create innovative solutions, and partner effectively to further reach and drive impact. Now turning briefly to our results, we once again delivered strong financial performance in this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our deleveraging objectives by year-end. Our consolidated revenue is $39.2 billion, and after tax earnings of $2.2 billion reflect continued strong execution of our strategy and the fundamental strength of our four well-positioned diversified growth platforms. In particular, the continued strong performance of our Health Service segment demonstrates the range of services and value we provide to diverse health plan, employer, federal and state government clients. Our Integrated Medical segment results reflect lower consumption of medical services, as individuals have deferred some services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, integrated medical customers continue to track much better than the national unemployment figures, as many employers have maintained benefits through this disruptive time, and importantly, because our client mix is less weighted to industries that have been most impacted by COVID-19. As our employer clients have continued to support their employees' health and wellness needs, we've provided hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to our employer clients, both through direct financial support and by leveraging our flexibility of our full suite of funding alternatives, all of which are already reflected in our second quarter results. I would also note that our self-funded medical clients have directly benefited from well in excess of $2 billion of reduced spending this year. Overall, I'm pleased that by maintaining the strength and health of our franchise, we've effectively balanced and responded to the needs of our stakeholders in this challenging environment. Now, to bring my comments to a close, the current environment we live in and work in is highly dynamic, unsettled and complex, and as I noted, more than any time in recent history. Cigna's strong second quarter results reflected continued strong execution of our strategy and the underlying strength of our four well-positioned diverse growth platforms. We have confidence that we will continue to effectively support our clients, communities, customers and patients, all while working to deliver on our EPS and revenue outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. This is driven by our sustained culture of innovation in our organization, the value we deliver to the marketplace each and every day, and aided by the financial strength and flexibility of our franchise. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Palmer: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. First, we've recognized that the current environment is even more dynamic, disrupted and complex than usual as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna has responded as we drive to be the champions for affordable, predictable, and simple health care. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full-year. Regarding our second quarter consolidated results a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $39.2 billion, adjusted earnings of $2.2 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $5.81, and continued strong operating cash flow of $3.3 billion. Within the second quarter, we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our businesses as we deliver value for customers and clients. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on health services. Second quarter adjusted revenues grew 22% to $29 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 7% to $1.2 billion. These results were driven by growth and customer event script volumes, favorable impacts from supply chain initiatives, strong specialty performance as our leading Accredo's specialty pharmacies proactively work with patients with complex and chronic conditions to maintain continuity of care for their medications, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses to support growth. We fulfilled $364 million adjusted pharmacy scripts in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 24% over a second quarter 2019, driven by the in-sourcing of integrated medical script volumes and strong organic growth, partially offset by somewhat lower retail network scripts related to acute needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, health services delivered another strong quarter as we continue to deliver value for our customers and clients. Turning to our Integrated Medical Segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $9 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion. In the quarter, we experienced significantly lower utilization of medical services in both commercial and government as individual deferred care due to the pandemic. By month compared to baseline expectations, utilization was 30% to 35% lower in April, 20% to 25% lower in May, and closer to normal in June at approximately 0% to 5% lower. We also experienced strong customer retention as our clients' maintained coverage for furloughed employees and our commercial book of business less weighted to the most economically impacted industries. In response to the pandemic and the tremendous burden is placing on those reserve, we are financially supporting our customers and clients. There are a series of actions including early on waiving all cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and for Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans additionally, waiving cost sharing for in office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. Additionally, we've provided premium relief programs for clients and financial assistance programs to support providers. All in our results for the quarter include approximately $270 million of charges related to these initiatives. It's also important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's U.S. commercial customers through self-funded arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients, who have seen savings well in excess of $2 billion year-to-date related to deferred medical costs. Turning to our international markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $319 million, reflecting deferred medical utilization primarily in our global health benefits business. Claims volumes as well as sales activities increased throughout the quarter as global economies reopened. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings for the segment were $132 million, reflecting elevated life claims primarily due to the pandemic partially offset by favorable performance and disability. Overall, our businesses remained focused and delivered strong performance in the second quarter as we work to rapidly innovate to serve our customers and patients in this disruptive environment. Now, looking forward to our outlook for the full-year, we continue to focus on driving strong performance across our businesses to continue to be able to improve the health wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we continue to expect full-year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion, and we continue to expect to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect medical utilization to increase. We expect additional COVID-19 treatment costs, and we expect lower enrollment as well as continued lower net investment income, due to recessionary pressures. Inside in our guidance, we considered a range of scenarios regarding the rate and pace of the return of medical utilization, as well as the rate and pace of the reopening of the U.S. and global economies and subsequent impact on employment and customer levels. Our ability to deliver in a range of scenarios, underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs. We will continue to dynamically manage our businesses, ensuring that we are delivering on the fundamentals and meeting our customer's needs, while also continuing to provide financial support to our customers and clients in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full-year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full-year of contributions from a group disability and life business, although, we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals and disciplined expense management and deployment of capital. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses, generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with significant capital and financial flexibility. In the second quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of cash flows from operations, due to strong fundamental as well as the timing impact of approximately $900 million of delayed tax payments permitted under the CARES Act. Through the end of second quarter, we also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $8.3 million shares of stock for $1.5 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. And as of June 30th, we had $1.7 billion of cash available at the parent. Finally, we remain on track to close the sale of our group disability and life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy the share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43.5% as of June 30th, an improvement of 170 basis points from December 31st of 2019, and we remain on track to return on debt-to-capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, through the exceptionally dynamic and disruptive environment associated with COVID-19, Cigna has remained intensely focused on delivering affordability, predictability, and simplicity for the benefit of our customers, patients, and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to helping create vibrant, diverse, high performing communities, whether through partnerships with our employer, health plan or government clients with our provider partners, or with our customers directly. We've delivered strong fundamental performance this year. We'll also see lower medical costs from deferred care, and we continue to provide financial support to our clients and customers. We expect our strong fundamentals across our diverse portfolio of growth businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment, and as such, we continue to expect 2020 full-year adjusted EPS of $18, $18.60 per share, and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, I'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Thanks, good morning. I guess can you just give us a sense of your conversations with existing employer customers an appetite, if any, for sort of revisiting funding scenarios? I think in the past, you've talked about shared return models, any of that resonating, and then ASR enrollment was down slightly, but you had a more pronounced decline in fees, can you just help reconcile that, and if that's at all related to some of those changing in those funding scenarios would be helpful?\nDavid Cordani: Ralph, good morning. It's David. I'll take the first part, and I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. At a macro level, yes to what you stated at the first part of your question. So, a lot of dynamic interaction back and forth with employer clients is a regular part of our business, even more elevated in the current environment, a lot of proactive engagement in the change relative to maximizing value for them through using our broad array of alternative funding mechanisms, and even the intra-year conversation, given the uniqueness how this year is playing out bringing more choice to clients. So, yes, continuation of we see it as a strength and continue to see movement in the use of funding mechanisms to best align ourselves with employers, and that plays to a strength of our company. I'll ask Eric to comment on the second piece relative to the fee dynamic.\nEric Palmer: Yes, Ralph. It's Eric. I would note two items as it relates to the fee dynamics; first and most significantly, we had a reclassification of certain revenues that we implemented actually back at the beginning of the year, so effective January 1st. That did not have an impact on the P&L, but it reduced revenues and has an exact offset in lower SG&A as well. So, that's showing up in the comparison of this year versus last year, and second, as you know, we did see some declines in self-funded enrollment, but just think that is consistent with the impact of COVID-19 and the economic environment overall.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, thank you. Maybe if I could ask about the utilization trends that you're seeing. I assume that, you talked to a fairly steep decline in April; I'm curious how you saw the month of June, and then coming into July, given the surge of cases in the Southeast and West, how that has affected your view of trend?\nEric Palmer: Yes, Matt. It's Eric. I will give you a couple of perspectives here. As I noted in my prepared remarks, and we saw the decline of 30% to 35% back in April, and utilization is uptick since then. You've called out geography, and that's a really important dimension here is looking at this play out market-by-market and having the local perspective is important, and we're certainly seeing this play out different rates and phases in different geographies. As I noted also in the prepared remarks, we saw June at much closer to normal level of utilization. I'd say our early indicators for July are pretty consistent with June. So, still some impacts moving through different geographies, but at this point, we'd say July looks an awful lot like June.\nMatthew Borsch: And have you seen in the Northeast as things have settled there, are you seeing evidence of flow-through of deferred electives and pent-up demand is there, can you see signs of temporary period of higher than normal trends coming in the wake of this?\nEric Palmer: I wouldn't call anything out on that yet, Matt. I think again, our outlook for the full-year does assume some additional utilization coming in the back-half of the year, but I think it'd be too early to say that we've seen anything like that within the second quarter.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the PBM here. Specifically, two things; one, your first-half growth has been significantly ahead of at least the initial guidance for the full-year. So, by my math, it implies, you know, about 3% growth in the back-half versus about 8% growth in the first-half. So I'm just curious, I know you haven't updated in the guide, so do you expect this first-half performance to be indicative of the full-year, or not with the kind of swing factors first-half to the second-half? And then also your scripts are running kind of better than I think a lot of people would have expected, given the slowdown in scripts in the second quarter overall, so can you give us some color there, and maybe any color on kind of mail order mix in the second quarter and the kind of profitability drivers there? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Hi, Justin. It's Eric. Good morning. So, on the first part of your question for the health services and kind of the pattern of the earning, we just step back, the normal pattern for this business is for income to grow throughout the year, as you know, just reflects the overall utilization patterns, and our efforts to manage the supply chain, and we think that will continue to play out throughout the course of 2020. Now I'll remind you, in 2019, the pattern was a little bit extra weighted towards the back-half of the year just given the timing of the supply chain initiatives. So, when you are comparing 2020 to 2019, you'll see that the impact of that kind of play out to the year. We think of 2020 as being more of a normal pattern this year. We think of 2019 was a little bit backend weighted. So, that'd be the biggest dynamic I'd call out as it relates to the pattern. Now, as it relates to the script volumes, overall, we're executing very well and very much in line with the pattern that we had expected to play itself out. As I noted back at our call a quarter-ago, we did see, or we estimated to be about five million scripts get refilled a little earlier that moved from the second quarter into the first quarter, and since that played out, and additionally we've seen nice utilization within our home delivery pharmacy. There's a lot of benefits to the mail order pharmacy and such for our customers and clients. We've seen that adoption continue to be good, but again, nothing else I'd call out in terms of major dynamics.\nJustin Lake: Great.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I want to ask about the commercial membership trends, I guess that you're thinking about for the back-half of the year, I appreciate that, you mentioned that furloughs has impacted as well as your customer exposure, but just maybe if you go down to both of those a little bit, have you had any conversations with clients about membership at risk from furloughs just to sign kind of size, what that might mean in the back-half of the year, and then the comment about being less exposed to the markets most impacted by COVID, are you seeing a differential in trend, or are you seeing those customers in the segments you expect to be impacted seeing larger declines in enrollment already versus the other sectors? So, any color there?\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, good morning. It's David. So, let me try to paint the 2020 picture, and then maybe even bleed in a little bit of comments in terms of how we expect to unfold beyond that going into 2021. So, first and foremost, a significant amount of interaction with clients, always part of our consultative approach, elevated even further in the current environment and the dynamism. So, we're looking at this as best we can through a client-by-client framework. As we noted previously, a high percentage of clients have maintained benefits either through the use of the word that we talk about is furloughs or layoffs with benefit continuity taking place, and I think that's a testament to how committed employers are to the health safety and wellbeing of their employees, and the optimism they continue to hold on to return employees back to work to keep their businesses running on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the second-half of the year, we expect the following: we expect to see those employees who are furloughed, or with continuity of benefits, we expect to see those furloughs dissipate or go away, and one or two things transpire either (a), no benefits for the employee and they transition to [indiscernible] or other alternatives, or (b), they return to full employment, and client-by-client, we're going through patterning of what the expectations are relative to that. Therefore, we expect to see the effect of lower levels of employment across our book continue throughout the second-half of the year, and that's fully factored into the outlook that Eric made reference to. And then finally, maybe at the most macro level, the way we're thinking about it is essentially over the next 18 months, second-half of '20 and 2021, we expect to see a slow recovery to the overall employment marketplace in the United States, and that's what's factored into our thinking, said otherwise, we expect to see pressure of through the second-half of this year and 2021 to what would otherwise be a normal course of business from a membership standpoint, and that's factored into our thinking for 2020 as well as 2021.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Go ahead, sir.\nKevin Fischbeck: Do you have any color about the impact on the members, who are [indiscernible] impacted by COVID versus those [infected] [ph] that you don't see disrupted, any difference in trend there?\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, stay on the line. Are you asking the question of medical trend or employment dynamic?\nKevin Fischbeck: Sorry. It's the employment dynamic. Second part of my question was, you know, are you seeing a differential in employment -- or job losses or in markets where you said that you have low exposure to those segments that are impacted by COVID, so just wanted to see if you are seeing any differential in the employment trends.\nDavid Cordani: The answer to that is absolutely yes. So, as we parse our business by sector, and then employer-by-employer, there is no doubt, there are some employers that are having either de minimis impact to their employee base as a result of COVID, or there are some factors that you're seeing actually the need for more employees, given the environment. So there is no doubt that the phenomenon we're talking about is incredibly uneven or unique not just to sector, but to employers within the sector. That's why our approach is a client-by-client approach, so yes to that portion, unequivocally high variability there.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser. Your line is open; from Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. David, going back to one of the comments in prepared remarks, you talked about partnering with some competitors, could you just share some details of the recent partnership with Oscar, how do you think about this developing, and I'm curious what is your appetite is for the exchange market?\nDavid Cordani: Ricky, good morning. So, appreciate you referencing the prepared remarks. My remarks said, of what some view is traditional competitors, we view as strategic partners. So stepping back, our philosophy has been we seek to be the undisputed partner of choice. And our view is that the ability to partner with others and work to create shared value presents an opportunity for mutual growth, which means more customers to serve in a larger impact. So, now stepping back, whether that's through an expanding portfolio of health plan clients through a health service portfolio, where we challenge ourselves to continue to bring additional innovations for the benefit of our health plan clients to help them deliver better affordability, better value and continue to grow or specifically to come to your question with Oscar. We have an exciting partnership with Oscar where we're bringing mutual capabilities to the table to bring some additional innovation to the small employer market, a marketplace that both organizations feel has been underserved as relates to benefiting from more innovative programs around health engagement, personalization, value based care, more comprehensive clinical engagement programs, and together we're going to be able to bring the best of both companies together. And at the later part of this year, we'll be opening up some additional markets where we're already quoting today, jointly, so the philosophy of the corporation is defined mutually aligned organizations where we could create leverage value together, and then pursue that and Oscar is a wonderful example of it. And actually, we had to check in with the team earlier this week, Eric and the team is working exceptionally well to get around the innovation here.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. You can ask your question.\nFrank Morgan: Yes, just one question around the difference. Could you distinguish any difference in what you saw regarding deferrals into commercial versus the Medicare book? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Frank, this is Eric. With a pattern was with similar in terms of how we progress through time, we would note we saw more of a deferral percentage in the commercial book than what we saw in the Medicare Advantage book, but again, kind of the progression month-to-month has been pretty consistent, just more significant impact in the commercial business.\nFrank Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Our next question comes from Whit Mayo with UBS. You may ask your question. Mr. Mayo, please check your mute feature.\nWhit Mayo: Sorry about that. Can you maybe -- I appreciate the question, can you maybe help us understand the impact of commercial leakage on the PBM? I'm just trying to crosswalk the two and think through what percent of your wrist members are with your PBM, and presumably, all the self-funded are, but I'm not sure that this is necessarily a one-to-one relationship. So any help would be great. And then also maybe just on the Medicaid enrollment that we're seeing sort of nationally. I know this isn't really impacting you per se, but maybe just the overall impact on the PBM given its exposure to Medicaid?\nDavid Cordani: Whit, it's David, can you repeat the first part of your question because Eric, and I didn't hear a couple of your words and we want to make sure we understand the query.\nWhit Mayo: Yes, I'm just trying to sort of cross walk the impact of commercial leakage. The declining commercial membership across risk and ASO how that impacts your PBM, and I think that the majority of your risk members are probably not with your -- with your PBM, and presumably the self-funded also I'm just trying to square the commercial leakage with the PBM?\nDavid Cordani: Great, I will ask Eric to take the first part of the question and I'll come back and take the second part of your question on Medicaid.\nEric Palmer: Good morning, Whit. On the leakage, as you termed it, maybe step back the -- I think the way I think about that is we have a kind of spectrum across our different customer segments. So within our Select segment, offering, really think about all of our Select segments as having a comprehensive bundle of our services, so pharmacy, behavioral, disease, and care management et cetera, all tied together with stop loss and administration or in our fully insured product, but to that point, think about the Select segment as being effectively 100% penetrated with our pharmacy offering, as you move into the middle market segment, reasonably high degree of penetration there, but you see more buyers that have smaller cart offerings are purchasing and such we've provided some statistics on this at the past and some of our past Investor Day materials, but think about, you know, a meaningful portion but not all of the middle market is having purchased an integrated offering, which then flows to the PBM, and then that same dynamic holds through in the national segment, it's even more \u00e0 la carte, if you will, in terms of the pieces that are, but the I think about it more along the segment lines than I would around just kind of the funding on it is true that the insured business also carries a high degree of penetration, but I encourage you to think about it by segment\nDavid Cordani: And Whit relative to Medicaid, we currently serve very attractive portfolio of Medicaid relationships through a health service portfolio. As a result of our diversion, high performing health plan, portfolio businesses, we see that as growing. We've grown that successfully. Notwithstanding the COVID pandemic ramifications and looking forward, we see that as a continued growing base of an opportunity for us to expand into servicing the Medicaid population, but servicing them through the health service platform.\nWhit Mayo: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Mayo. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I have a two part question about your MLR expectations. And your -- I think relatively appropriate conservatism or, you know, caution as we head into the back-half, but the question is, now as you anticipate higher MLR in the back-half, is that explicitly from an expectation around the deferred electives coming through or around an expectation about higher acuity care being required because of necessary, you know, deferred care during the pandemic, and do you have any evidence around those? That's the first part. The second is just given where you stand on your three year rolling, commercial MLR minimum positions, if we don't see this, pick up some MLR transpire should we still can -- should we assume that in the second-half, there is still pretty substantial flow through of MLR EPS?\nEric Palmer: Yes, Gary, this is Eric. So we'll take that one on a couple of different dimensions we've talked about there. First of all, stepping back, we expect a loss ratio to be somewhat elevated in the back-half of the year. Think about that as 150 to 200 basis points increase over what we previously would have expected for the second-half of the year. Not dimensioned that off a couple of things. One, we do think that there will be some deferred care utilization and the potential for higher acuity coming back in, and then, two, the ongoing effect of the programs we put in place to reduce co-payments or make care more accessible and affordable within quality drive of some additional utilization. I don't have a precise kind of identification of each of those components, but think about those as the biggest drivers for our outlets over the course of the back-half of the year. On the minimum MLR, as you know it's a three-year calculation for the minimum MLRs for the commercial business. So again, we generally speaking, do have a margin between where we are at and the minimum. Now I would know that we increased our accrual in the second quarter by $95 million, and we've got $175 million on the balance sheet for this as a provision at this point, and so it's something we watch, but would still know that there's across the board. Still a margin there before we did not see any of the impact kind of flows through the bottom-line.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. So, good morning, it's Josh here with [indiscernible] as well. What you see as more permanent changes as a result of the COVID pandemic, and what are you doing to make sure that Cigna is positioned to take advantage or capture those opportunities going forward?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, good morning. It's David. I'd identify two; one in terms of access, two, in terms of programmatic. As it relates to access, it's indisputable that the COVID pandemic has either required caused or pushed more utilization of technology as a mechanism to access care coordinate care et cetera. You recall that our view has been for some time that we believe a meaningful amount of care can be delivered through a combination of technology, you can call it tele, you call it virtual et cetera, but it needs to be highly coordinated care, and then, further augmented by in-home care that is also aided by technology. So one, we believe that the rate and pace of adoption and acceleration of reformatting care access, utilizing technology to coordinate care and deliver care in a personalized high-quality basis. And then augmenting it with re-envisioning what could take place in the home is mission critical and accelerated by COVID, that's on strategy for us, and we are aggressively investing in and innovating in those categories off of a variety of platforms. Secondly, a lot of what we talked about before. It's a little back to the future, but COVID re-highlights for all societies around the globe that as challenging as COVID is, it's exponentially more challenging for individuals who have chronic conditions or who are polychronic, so it presents another opportunity to engage with employers, with health policymakers and from a public health policy standpoint to make sure we're investing in and innovating programs with physicians and individuals to lower health risks or increase health quality for those who are chronic or polychronic because all things remaining equal, if you have a better health status, you're more likely to withstand COVID or the next generation, a decade from now and beyond, and that's an area where Cigna excels on our current state of basis in terms of what we're able to bring to bear from that standpoint, as well as with the health service portfolio, and then, putting up over that of COVID-19 highlights the mental health dimension that is, highlighted in societies around the globe, where the mental health and the physical health needs to come together to best manage overall wellbeing. So, reformatting, utilizing technology, chronic condition management and improving overall health risk and then taking mental health and the physical health together are all areas we see as being accelerated because of COVID and additional opportunities and areas that Cigna is heavily investing in.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Good morning guys. Just wanted to get your updated views on your strategic capital deployment priorities and in particular I was interested in, how you're prioritizing buybacks given the group sale, and then, if you've had any change in perspective or evolution involved in Medicaid, owning positions or other aspects of value-based care, and how you're looking at global now?\nDavid Cordani: Lance, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Eric to comment on the portion of your question specifically because of the uniqueness of the group sale, and then, I'll come back and talk about M&A priorities more broadly.\nEric Palmer: Yes, Lance, good morning. So just on the group sales specifically, so first of all, we do expect that transaction to close within the third quarter reminder, we expect $5.3 billion of after-tax proceeds once that transaction closes, so that is coming in, in the relatively near-term. As we've talked about for some time now, we've had a goal of and are committed to obtaining a debt or achieving a debt-to-capital ratio of under 40% by the end of the year. We're driving towards that, and we've committed to deploying a significant amount of the proceeds from the group transaction to share repurchase to offset the dilution, the effect of the not having the group insurance business for a portion of the year. So again, at the most macro level, those are the pieces we're navigating. We do continue to fund significant organic growth; we continue to have capital investments to advance our capabilities, but definitely, we see share repurchase as a really excellent use of capital to drive shareholder value in the near-term, and the last thing I note is just add our recent board meeting, our board increased the share repurchase authorization consistent with our expectation of closing the New York Life transaction later this quarter. And as we sit here today, we have $4.4 billion of share repurchase authority outstanding.\nDavid Cordani: And Lance relative to the portfolio of businesses today and going forward. First to be clear, we like our portfolio in the strategic positioning and are pleased with its performance from a growth standpoint, from a service standpoint and from a capital and fiscal flexibility standpoint that portfolio is positioned to deliver sustained 6% to 8% revenue growth. As it relates to M&A priorities, we continue to remain focused on five specific M&A priorities; one, to further strategically and smartly over global footprint, second, to further enhance our U.S. seniors' capabilities, third, continue to broaden our digital and information capabilities, fourth, looking to continue to expand our care coordination capabilities, and five, as we've talked before, exploring state-based risk program capabilities as we see states who are under budgetary pressure for within their Medicaid programs, seek to further sub segment their programs and seek either high credit -- high cost complex critical programs to be able to perform on their behalf and deliver more value. So, we see opportunity going forward, but building off of a very strong base and low performing portfolio.\nLance Wilkes: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. You may ask your question.\nSarah James: Thank you. Can you talk about any slowdown that you've seen in the pace of receiving claims from the date of service, and then on your risk business, what impact that's made on your reserving policy or any impact to MLR? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Hi, Sarah, it's Eric. Broadly, I wouldn't call out any change in terms of impact. Since again nothing that would rise to being inevitable. With respect to our reserving approaches and policies has been very consistent, because the same team and the same approach to working through those calculations for some time, it served us really pretty well so I wouldn't note anything unusual here.\nSarah James: But are you seeing a slowdown in claims, especially timing?\nEric Palmer: No.\nSarah James: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. James. So our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Just wondering some discussion about the selling season I'd seen in your press release; you're talking about in the health service division [indiscernible] I wonder, if you could just talk through a little bit what you're seeing for the 2021 selling season related to integrative medical and the health services division, how the COVID impact is on that process whether it slows it down or causes people to defer decisions, and if I could just slip in as well on the healthcare services division. And I know you're not seeing much attrition in the integrative medical, but how is the economic slowdown impacting the PBM side of the business, if at all?\nDavid Cordani: A.J., it's David. I'll take the selling season. I'll ask Eric to comment briefly on the year equivalent of its enrollment on the integrated medical what we're seeing on the health service portfolio. First broadly on the selling season, I appreciate you asked about multiple segments of business. Headline is well we're not guiding for 2021 yet, we will expect another year of attractive revenue growth for the franchise in 2021. For the health service portfolio that will be anchored in a third consecutive year of truly outstanding client retention, where our clients continue to reward us by staying with us and expanding the relationship because of the services we're delivering because of the continued innovation we're delivering, and because of the outstanding affordability or market trends we're delivering on their behalf. Before I jump over to Integrated Medical comments on Medicare Advantage, we would expect another year of attractive customer growth within our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and I will remind you we set a strategic objective to grow Medicare Advantage customers 10% to 15%. We're tracking well to that objective in 2020. We would expect to know the year of contribution in 2021, and specific to the Integrated Medical, our visibility in 2021 is largely through the national accounts at this point in time, and to remind you we defined that as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees. We're a multi-state, at this point in time, we expect to see that tracking to a bit higher retention rate than recent past. And while we have some new business wins, we expect the new business wins to be a little less than recent past taken as a whole, probably performing a little better as we step into 2021 off of that portfolio, and then the middle market or regional and select segments are currently in the throes of their growth trajectories as we look into 2021. Wrapping it up, we would expect again another year of very attractive and profitable revenue growth for 2021. Eric, maybe just a little color on the health services dynamic of the equivalent disenrollment?\nEric Palmer: Thanks, David, and good morning, A.J. So, on the health services business, again within the segment, I think we've talked about in the past we've got a really diversified book of business here with customers through a variety of channels and players that are helped play on government relationships, some direct programs and the like, we've had a really strong degree of client retention and we've had a high degree of continuity in terms of enrollment within those clients as well. So note in my prepared remarks, we did have a bit of a dip of retail acute scripts, especially earlier in the quarter, but that'd be really the only thing I would call out is particularly impactful. Overall, the enrollment levels within our clients and within our health plan clients have held up quite nicely.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. The next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. You may ask your question.\nStephen Tanal: Hey good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just one really quick follow-up on strategic M&A, and then an actual question, so I just want to understand what would you say we should expect with respect to the size of any future deals you might choose to do, and your willingness to do another large deal just following up on that question earlier, and I also just wanted to get your latest thoughts, obviously in the executive order last Friday order HHS to put out the rebate rule again, but it was conditioned on being able to demonstrate no increase in premium or really any kind of cost any payers, which looks pretty unlikely given the CBO scoring the first time around, but just given the prospect, I guess it'd be helpful if you could just remind us how to think about that rule and its potential effect on the economics of the PBM business and Medicare? That'd be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Sure, good morning. It's David. I'll take both questions. On the first question as I noted before, we're really pleased with the configuration of our business portfolio today and its performance. I'm not going to comment on size of assets. We've been quite disciplined over a long period of time relative to strategic alignment and financial alignment relative to assets we would pursue. And it would be inappropriate to say that there's an asset of the certain type or size from that standpoint that we would limit ourselves to. Specific to the executive order, stepping back; first, at the more macro level, we share the administration's objectives to further improve affordability of prescription drugs. There's no doubt about that and concrete examples, including we were the first to step into the need to reformat the diabetes and insulin environment with a patient insurance program that caps cost at $25 for 30-day supply. It truly creates affordable, simple, predictable, or embark program that focuses on high cost specialty drugs, or recent launch of our Parachute program for workers who've been displaced. So we will continue to drive innovation, and our clients are benefiting from that relative to our market leading trends. Specific to the rebate rule, your overall framing I think is right. Specifically, we do believe the rebate rule, if implemented in its current configuration would have a material effect on Cigna. It focuses on the government programs and as you know as designed today, the government run programs required and are facilitated by full pass-through, fully transparent rebate economic to start with. They were designed in the pricing scheme as indicated by government rules that we all comply with as an industry. The result of this rebate rule change is designed will result in increasing cost all seniors as an example, and thereby decreasing cost for some depending on their point-in-time drug utilization, and the rule is written today would create a conflict in terms of what would transpire around that, but from a Cigna perspective, we do not see that as having an impact on our book of business and overall performance even if the rebate rule was implemented.\nStephen Tanal: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Tanal. Our next question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nBob Jones: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Eric, maybe just to go back to one on the PBM comment you made earlier in Q&A about not pulling anything major as far dynamics. I was just wondering how the Prime roll on has been going. Had that any major impact on the quarter? Is that kind of going according to plan, and then maybe just you haven't spent a lot of time on Accredo, maybe just any kind of parsing out of volumes of the traditional pharmacy business have trended relative to the specialty pharmacy. Have you seen any differential impact there as a result of the COVID environment?\nEric Palmer: Yes, Bob. It's Eric. Good morning. So with respect Prime, we announced the collaboration with Prime last December. We worked quite diligently over the end of the year and through the first quarter to get ready for that when we began servicing that collaboration on April 1st. It's really performed very well and very much consistent with our expectations both in terms of services provided, timing and the volumes and the like such to getting up to a great start. We are delighted to have the relationship there. In terms of specialty, I appreciate you calling out Accredo. Accredo continues to be industry leading capability here, and it does continue to drive growth as we see more and more specialty products and as more and more clinical needs the clients those we serve or both of those things drive an additional growth within Accredo. So again, continued strong growth there as well and that's a real bright spot even in the strong health services results.\nBob Jones: Right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our last question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may ask your question.\nCharles Rhyee: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe I could ask a question about the international segment, David. You kind of said earlier sort of lower claims volumes benefiting the quarter, but maybe you can give us some sense in what your expectations are sort for maybe for the back-half. And give a sense of what the trends you are seeing globally related to COVID. And if there is anything that you can take from that as we think about how COVID may progress here in the States. Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Yes, Chuck, it's Eric. I will start here. With respect to international if you noted it was a strong result year-to-date. And the segment overall continues to perform really well. We've got as I think you know two platforms within the international business. A global health benefits platform that serves employers and a more individually oriented platform that serves both kind of health and supplemental needs and such. With the employer book of business, I would say globally the dynamics were pretty similar to the dynamics that we talked about in our Integrated Medical segment. So, we saw a deferral, less utilization earlier in the quarter. Some of that's come back over the balance of the quarter. We continue to expect to see a slower recovery in terms of employment levels and the like within this business, but I think of it is having a lot of parallels with the U.S. medical business. On individual business, I think here we saw disruption back in first quarter even in terms of both sales and in terms of claims experience and such. Really seen a lot of that come back in Asia, and our Asian market is already and very much kind of back to normal in a lot of our individually oriented businesses at this point. So again, looking forward from here, we would see a continued strong performance in a business, continued growth trajectory from a growth perspective. David, what else you would like to add here?\nDavid Cordani: Just add in the learning category, as we are learning in the United States, state-by-state, we are seeing around the globe the imperative of being flexible as the pandemic ebbs and flows from that standpoint from community standpoint from health access standpoint, from the academic standpoint, from the employer standpoint, and secondly, we have seen consistently around the globe a more aggressive adoption of as I referenced before technologically-enabled health access solutions, even in environments where they previously were at a really low adoption rate, less desire to go to physical proximity to access care, if it could be delivered through technology, and we see an elevation of that those services being utilized around the globe. We think that trend will continue.\nCharles Rhyee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rhyee. At this time, I turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks. Just briefly wrap up, I want to first and foremost again acknowledge and thank Cigna's more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe who worked tirelessly with great empathy throughout this pandemic to serve the needs of our customers, our patients, work within our communities, and support our clients around the world. At Cigna, our mission to improve health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and that continues to guide our actions, and will as we go forward. In recent weeks and months, we've taken decisive actions to support our employers who we believe are the driving force to a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to support the communities and customers we work and serve in each and every day, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we also view as a critical health issue. From a results perspective, we once again delivered strong financial performance this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our de-leveraging objectives by the end of this year. We continue to expand and innovative programs and services to support our clients, our customers, our patients, and our communities, and we are on track to deliver our revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. With that, I thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to future discussions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's second quarter 2020 results review.

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. The current environment that we all live in and work in is more dynamic, more unsettled, and more complex than any time in recent history, and Cigna's mission to improve the health, wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and it continues to guide the actions as we move forward. In recent weeks and months, we have taken decisive steps to support employers who are the driving force of a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to support our communities, customers, and patients, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we view as a critical health issue as a well. Today, I'll offer several recent examples of how we continue to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and with our key stakeholders by delivering on our promises and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable, and simple by creating innovative solutions to solve for healthcare's most complex challenges and by partnering with our clients, some of whom are viewed as competitors, but who we see as strategic partners capable of extending our reach to making even greater impact for customers around the globe. We view all of this with the goal of maintaining and improving the health and vibrancy of our clients, communities, and customers. I will also give you an update on our financial results that we delivered for the quarter, and how these results provide a further testament to the strength of our businesses and the value we create for our customers and clients, as well as a few comments on our growth path forward, and then, I will conclude with a brief update on our outlook before turning the call over to Eric. Cigna's longstanding commitment to our clients, communities, and customers is fundamental to who we are as a global health service company, and it has been critical in shaping our ongoing response to COVID-19 crisis. This response begins with our more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe, who worked tirelessly and with great empathy throughout this pandemic. They wake up each and every day with the sole focus to serve the needs of our customers, patients, and clients around the globe, and I am proud to be teamed up with such a talented group of co-workers, and I thank them for what they do to positively impact millions of lives each and every day. Nowhere is their commitment more evident than in their deep support of our employer clients; large, small, public, private. These businesses have always been critical to a robust economy, and today more than ever companies will play an essential role in serving individuals, reenergizing their communities and returning economies around the world to economic vibrancy. From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, Cigna's leverage of breadth of solution, strength of our team, and a consultative approach in our broad data and analytical capabilities to support our employer clients and their employees in numerous ways from taking rapid and decisive steps to eliminate cost as a barrier to testing and treatment, to expanding to access to care, to helping them safely work to return their employees to worksites, most recently, for example, with the launch of our COVID-19 high risk dashboard. This new suite of innovative analytical tools combines the power of data, predictive models, and clinical expertise to help clients project how COVID-19 might impact the health and safety of their employee populations, and to model forward impacts of different pandemic scenarios going forward. For example, the dashboard compiles and analyzes COVID-19 case data on the health of that client-specific employees at national, state, and county levels, giving them essential insights to guide their decision-making for bringing employees back to work safely. In cases, where employers see concerning trends in the reports, Cigna is prepared to help them take action. For instance, through routes like COVID-19 testing and triage services delivered from on our Cigna onsite health solutions. Our COVID-19 high risk taskforce represents just one powerful example of how Cigna is helping employers navigate the complexities of the pandemic, and serves as a reinforcement of why employers rank Cigna highest amongst its competitors for driving healthcare quality and value as reported in a recent study conducted by The Leapfrog Group, an independent national organization representing employers. Turning to our support of communities where we live, work, and play each and every day, our commitment is reflected in our efforts to increase understanding of the impacts of, and to drive positive changes to combat systemic racism, and only is systemic racism an issue of human rights, we also view it as a critical health issue, contributing to well-documented disparities in health treatment and outcomes that disproportionately impact communities of color. Two weeks ago, we launched our new five-year initiative, our building equity and equality program, which commits a mix of local community grants, scholarship funds, and employee volunteer hours to continue to drive Cigna's efforts to eliminate racism, bias, and health and economic disparities for people of color. This new initiative is another important part of Cigna's ongoing commitment to partner with our communities and government leaders to effect positive sustainable change, and we will continue to expand and evolve our engagement programs going forward. All of Cigna's efforts to partner with our clients and communities is ultimately rooted in our mission to improve the health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve, specifically focused on customers and patients. Today, more than ever, they are looking for us to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We continue to introduce new innovative programs and solutions designed to deliver on this promise. For example, our Customer Protection Program, which safeguards our customers from unexpected costs from COVID-19 through surprise or balance bills from out-of-network providers. In addition, our pharmacy solutions leverage existing and newly-created tools to put resources and medicines and treatments in the hands of those who need the most. For example, we help Americans who lose their prescription coverage from recent job loss to secure their medications at affordable predictable prices through our Express Scripts Parachute Pharmacy Program. Further, as demonstrated by our most recent drug term report, we also delivered affordability and predictability to our health service customers and clients, who in 2019, experienced an overall rate of increase of drug spending of just 2.3%, a result that is in line with the Consumer Price Index, and important to note, more than one-third of our commercial plans experienced a decrease in overall spending in 2019. Taken altogether these examples I've shared with you today are reflective of how Cigna is and will continue to deliver on our promises, create innovative solutions, and partner effectively to further reach and drive impact. Now turning briefly to our results, we once again delivered strong financial performance in this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our deleveraging objectives by year-end. Our consolidated revenue is $39.2 billion, and after tax earnings of $2.2 billion reflect continued strong execution of our strategy and the fundamental strength of our four well-positioned diversified growth platforms. In particular, the continued strong performance of our Health Service segment demonstrates the range of services and value we provide to diverse health plan, employer, federal and state government clients. Our Integrated Medical segment results reflect lower consumption of medical services, as individuals have deferred some services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, integrated medical customers continue to track much better than the national unemployment figures, as many employers have maintained benefits through this disruptive time, and importantly, because our client mix is less weighted to industries that have been most impacted by COVID-19. As our employer clients have continued to support their employees' health and wellness needs, we've provided hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to our employer clients, both through direct financial support and by leveraging our flexibility of our full suite of funding alternatives, all of which are already reflected in our second quarter results. I would also note that our self-funded medical clients have directly benefited from well in excess of $2 billion of reduced spending this year. Overall, I'm pleased that by maintaining the strength and health of our franchise, we've effectively balanced and responded to the needs of our stakeholders in this challenging environment. Now, to bring my comments to a close, the current environment we live in and work in is highly dynamic, unsettled and complex, and as I noted, more than any time in recent history. Cigna's strong second quarter results reflected continued strong execution of our strategy and the underlying strength of our four well-positioned diverse growth platforms. We have confidence that we will continue to effectively support our clients, communities, customers and patients, all while working to deliver on our EPS and revenue outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. This is driven by our sustained culture of innovation in our organization, the value we deliver to the marketplace each and every day, and aided by the financial strength and flexibility of our franchise. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. Ralph, good morning. It's David. I'll take the first part, and I will ask Eric to take the second part of your question. At a macro level, yes to what you stated at the first part of your question. So, a lot of dynamic interaction back and forth with employer clients is a regular part of our business, even more elevated in the current environment, a lot of proactive engagement in the change relative to maximizing value for them through using our broad array of alternative funding mechanisms, and even the intra-year conversation, given the uniqueness how this year is playing out bringing more choice to clients. So, yes, continuation of we see it as a strength and continue to see movement in the use of funding mechanisms to best align ourselves with employers, and that plays to a strength of our company. I'll ask Eric to comment on the second piece relative to the fee dynamic. Kevin, good morning. It's David. So, let me try to paint the 2020 picture, and then maybe even bleed in a little bit of comments in terms of how we expect to unfold beyond that going into 2021. So, first and foremost, a significant amount of interaction with clients, always part of our consultative approach, elevated even further in the current environment and the dynamism. So, we're looking at this as best we can through a client-by-client framework. As we noted previously, a high percentage of clients have maintained benefits either through the use of the word that we talk about is furloughs or layoffs with benefit continuity taking place, and I think that's a testament to how committed employers are to the health safety and wellbeing of their employees, and the optimism they continue to hold on to return employees back to work to keep their businesses running on a go-forward basis. As it relates to the second-half of the year, we expect the following: we expect to see those employees who are furloughed, or with continuity of benefits, we expect to see those furloughs dissipate or go away, and one or two things transpire either (a), no benefits for the employee and they transition to [indiscernible] or other alternatives, or (b), they return to full employment, and client-by-client, we're going through patterning of what the expectations are relative to that. Therefore, we expect to see the effect of lower levels of employment across our book continue throughout the second-half of the year, and that's fully factored into the outlook that Eric made reference to. And then finally, maybe at the most macro level, the way we're thinking about it is essentially over the next 18 months, second-half of '20 and 2021, we expect to see a slow recovery to the overall employment marketplace in the United States, and that's what's factored into our thinking, said otherwise, we expect to see pressure of through the second-half of this year and 2021 to what would otherwise be a normal course of business from a membership standpoint, and that's factored into our thinking for 2020 as well as 2021. Kevin, stay on the line. Are you asking the question of medical trend or employment dynamic? The answer to that is absolutely yes. So, as we parse our business by sector, and then employer-by-employer, there is no doubt, there are some employers that are having either de minimis impact to their employee base as a result of COVID, or there are some factors that you're seeing actually the need for more employees, given the environment. So there is no doubt that the phenomenon we're talking about is incredibly uneven or unique not just to sector, but to employers within the sector. That's why our approach is a client-by-client approach, so yes to that portion, unequivocally high variability there. Ricky, good morning. So, appreciate you referencing the prepared remarks. My remarks said, of what some view is traditional competitors, we view as strategic partners. So stepping back, our philosophy has been we seek to be the undisputed partner of choice. And our view is that the ability to partner with others and work to create shared value presents an opportunity for mutual growth, which means more customers to serve in a larger impact. So, now stepping back, whether that's through an expanding portfolio of health plan clients through a health service portfolio, where we challenge ourselves to continue to bring additional innovations for the benefit of our health plan clients to help them deliver better affordability, better value and continue to grow or specifically to come to your question with Oscar. We have an exciting partnership with Oscar where we're bringing mutual capabilities to the table to bring some additional innovation to the small employer market, a marketplace that both organizations feel has been underserved as relates to benefiting from more innovative programs around health engagement, personalization, value based care, more comprehensive clinical engagement programs, and together we're going to be able to bring the best of both companies together. And at the later part of this year, we'll be opening up some additional markets where we're already quoting today, jointly, so the philosophy of the corporation is defined mutually aligned organizations where we could create leverage value together, and then pursue that and Oscar is a wonderful example of it. And actually, we had to check in with the team earlier this week, Eric and the team is working exceptionally well to get around the innovation here. Whit, it's David, can you repeat the first part of your question because Eric, and I didn't hear a couple of your words and we want to make sure we understand the query. Great, I will ask Eric to take the first part of the question and I'll come back and take the second part of your question on Medicaid. And Whit relative to Medicaid, we currently serve very attractive portfolio of Medicaid relationships through a health service portfolio. As a result of our diversion, high performing health plan, portfolio businesses, we see that as growing. We've grown that successfully. Notwithstanding the COVID pandemic ramifications and looking forward, we see that as a continued growing base of an opportunity for us to expand into servicing the Medicaid population, but servicing them through the health service platform. Josh, good morning. It's David. I'd identify two; one in terms of access, two, in terms of programmatic. As it relates to access, it's indisputable that the COVID pandemic has either required caused or pushed more utilization of technology as a mechanism to access care coordinate care et cetera. You recall that our view has been for some time that we believe a meaningful amount of care can be delivered through a combination of technology, you can call it tele, you call it virtual et cetera, but it needs to be highly coordinated care, and then, further augmented by in-home care that is also aided by technology. So one, we believe that the rate and pace of adoption and acceleration of reformatting care access, utilizing technology to coordinate care and deliver care in a personalized high-quality basis. And then augmenting it with re-envisioning what could take place in the home is mission critical and accelerated by COVID, that's on strategy for us, and we are aggressively investing in and innovating in those categories off of a variety of platforms. Secondly, a lot of what we talked about before. It's a little back to the future, but COVID re-highlights for all societies around the globe that as challenging as COVID is, it's exponentially more challenging for individuals who have chronic conditions or who are polychronic, so it presents another opportunity to engage with employers, with health policymakers and from a public health policy standpoint to make sure we're investing in and innovating programs with physicians and individuals to lower health risks or increase health quality for those who are chronic or polychronic because all things remaining equal, if you have a better health status, you're more likely to withstand COVID or the next generation, a decade from now and beyond, and that's an area where Cigna excels on our current state of basis in terms of what we're able to bring to bear from that standpoint, as well as with the health service portfolio, and then, putting up over that of COVID-19 highlights the mental health dimension that is, highlighted in societies around the globe, where the mental health and the physical health needs to come together to best manage overall wellbeing. So, reformatting, utilizing technology, chronic condition management and improving overall health risk and then taking mental health and the physical health together are all areas we see as being accelerated because of COVID and additional opportunities and areas that Cigna is heavily investing in. Lance, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Eric to comment on the portion of your question specifically because of the uniqueness of the group sale, and then, I'll come back and talk about M&A priorities more broadly. And Lance relative to the portfolio of businesses today and going forward. First to be clear, we like our portfolio in the strategic positioning and are pleased with its performance from a growth standpoint, from a service standpoint and from a capital and fiscal flexibility standpoint that portfolio is positioned to deliver sustained 6% to 8% revenue growth. As it relates to M&A priorities, we continue to remain focused on five specific M&A priorities; one, to further strategically and smartly over global footprint, second, to further enhance our U.S. seniors' capabilities, third, continue to broaden our digital and information capabilities, fourth, looking to continue to expand our care coordination capabilities, and five, as we've talked before, exploring state-based risk program capabilities as we see states who are under budgetary pressure for within their Medicaid programs, seek to further sub segment their programs and seek either high credit -- high cost complex critical programs to be able to perform on their behalf and deliver more value. So, we see opportunity going forward, but building off of a very strong base and low performing portfolio. A.J., it's David. I'll take the selling season. I'll ask Eric to comment briefly on the year equivalent of its enrollment on the integrated medical what we're seeing on the health service portfolio. First broadly on the selling season, I appreciate you asked about multiple segments of business. Headline is well we're not guiding for 2021 yet, we will expect another year of attractive revenue growth for the franchise in 2021. For the health service portfolio that will be anchored in a third consecutive year of truly outstanding client retention, where our clients continue to reward us by staying with us and expanding the relationship because of the services we're delivering because of the continued innovation we're delivering, and because of the outstanding affordability or market trends we're delivering on their behalf. Before I jump over to Integrated Medical comments on Medicare Advantage, we would expect another year of attractive customer growth within our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and I will remind you we set a strategic objective to grow Medicare Advantage customers 10% to 15%. We're tracking well to that objective in 2020. We would expect to know the year of contribution in 2021, and specific to the Integrated Medical, our visibility in 2021 is largely through the national accounts at this point in time, and to remind you we defined that as commercial employers with 5,000 or more employees. We're a multi-state, at this point in time, we expect to see that tracking to a bit higher retention rate than recent past. And while we have some new business wins, we expect the new business wins to be a little less than recent past taken as a whole, probably performing a little better as we step into 2021 off of that portfolio, and then the middle market or regional and select segments are currently in the throes of their growth trajectories as we look into 2021. Wrapping it up, we would expect again another year of very attractive and profitable revenue growth for 2021. Eric, maybe just a little color on the health services dynamic of the equivalent disenrollment? Sure, good morning. It's David. I'll take both questions. On the first question as I noted before, we're really pleased with the configuration of our business portfolio today and its performance. I'm not going to comment on size of assets. We've been quite disciplined over a long period of time relative to strategic alignment and financial alignment relative to assets we would pursue. And it would be inappropriate to say that there's an asset of the certain type or size from that standpoint that we would limit ourselves to. Specific to the executive order, stepping back; first, at the more macro level, we share the administration's objectives to further improve affordability of prescription drugs. There's no doubt about that and concrete examples, including we were the first to step into the need to reformat the diabetes and insulin environment with a patient insurance program that caps cost at $25 for 30-day supply. It truly creates affordable, simple, predictable, or embark program that focuses on high cost specialty drugs, or recent launch of our Parachute program for workers who've been displaced. So we will continue to drive innovation, and our clients are benefiting from that relative to our market leading trends. Specific to the rebate rule, your overall framing I think is right. Specifically, we do believe the rebate rule, if implemented in its current configuration would have a material effect on Cigna. It focuses on the government programs and as you know as designed today, the government run programs required and are facilitated by full pass-through, fully transparent rebate economic to start with. They were designed in the pricing scheme as indicated by government rules that we all comply with as an industry. The result of this rebate rule change is designed will result in increasing cost all seniors as an example, and thereby decreasing cost for some depending on their point-in-time drug utilization, and the rule is written today would create a conflict in terms of what would transpire around that, but from a Cigna perspective, we do not see that as having an impact on our book of business and overall performance even if the rebate rule was implemented. Just add in the learning category, as we are learning in the United States, state-by-state, we are seeing around the globe the imperative of being flexible as the pandemic ebbs and flows from that standpoint from community standpoint from health access standpoint, from the academic standpoint, from the employer standpoint, and secondly, we have seen consistently around the globe a more aggressive adoption of as I referenced before technologically-enabled health access solutions, even in environments where they previously were at a really low adoption rate, less desire to go to physical proximity to access care, if it could be delivered through technology, and we see an elevation of that those services being utilized around the globe. We think that trend will continue. Thanks. Just briefly wrap up, I want to first and foremost again acknowledge and thank Cigna's more than 70,000 colleagues around the globe who worked tirelessly with great empathy throughout this pandemic to serve the needs of our customers, our patients, work within our communities, and support our clients around the world. At Cigna, our mission to improve health wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve has never been more important, and that continues to guide our actions, and will as we go forward. In recent weeks and months, we've taken decisive actions to support our employers who we believe are the driving force to a thriving economy to withstand and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to support the communities and customers we work and serve in each and every day, including our efforts to combat systemic racism, which we also view as a critical health issue. From a results perspective, we once again delivered strong financial performance this quarter, and we remain on track to complete our integration and reach our de-leveraging objectives by the end of this year. We continue to expand and innovative programs and services to support our clients, our customers, our patients, and our communities, and we are on track to deliver our revenue and EPS outlook for 2020, as well as our 2021 EPS target of $20 to $21 per share. With that, I thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to future discussions."

            "name": "Eric Palmer",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. First, we've recognized that the current environment is even more dynamic, disrupted and complex than usual as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna has responded as we drive to be the champions for affordable, predictable, and simple health care. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter results, including the impact of COVID-19 on our business and discuss our outlook for the full-year. Regarding our second quarter consolidated results a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $39.2 billion, adjusted earnings of $2.2 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $5.81, and continued strong operating cash flow of $3.3 billion. Within the second quarter, we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our businesses as we deliver value for customers and clients. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on health services. Second quarter adjusted revenues grew 22% to $29 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 7% to $1.2 billion. These results were driven by growth and customer event script volumes, favorable impacts from supply chain initiatives, strong specialty performance as our leading Accredo's specialty pharmacies proactively work with patients with complex and chronic conditions to maintain continuity of care for their medications, partly offset by an increase in operating expenses to support growth. We fulfilled $364 million adjusted pharmacy scripts in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 24% over a second quarter 2019, driven by the in-sourcing of integrated medical script volumes and strong organic growth, partially offset by somewhat lower retail network scripts related to acute needs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, health services delivered another strong quarter as we continue to deliver value for our customers and clients. Turning to our Integrated Medical Segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $9 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion. In the quarter, we experienced significantly lower utilization of medical services in both commercial and government as individual deferred care due to the pandemic. By month compared to baseline expectations, utilization was 30% to 35% lower in April, 20% to 25% lower in May, and closer to normal in June at approximately 0% to 5% lower. We also experienced strong customer retention as our clients' maintained coverage for furloughed employees and our commercial book of business less weighted to the most economically impacted industries. In response to the pandemic and the tremendous burden is placing on those reserve, we are financially supporting our customers and clients. There are a series of actions including early on waiving all cost sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment and for Medicare Advantage and individual and family plans additionally, waiving cost sharing for in office and telehealth visits for primary care, specialty care, and behavioral health. Additionally, we've provided premium relief programs for clients and financial assistance programs to support providers. All in our results for the quarter include approximately $270 million of charges related to these initiatives. It's also important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's U.S. commercial customers through self-funded arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients, who have seen savings well in excess of $2 billion year-to-date related to deferred medical costs. Turning to our international markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.4 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $319 million, reflecting deferred medical utilization primarily in our global health benefits business. Claims volumes as well as sales activities increased throughout the quarter as global economies reopened. For our Group Disability and Other Operations segment, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion. Second quarter adjusted pre-tax earnings for the segment were $132 million, reflecting elevated life claims primarily due to the pandemic partially offset by favorable performance and disability. Overall, our businesses remained focused and delivered strong performance in the second quarter as we work to rapidly innovate to serve our customers and patients in this disruptive environment. Now, looking forward to our outlook for the full-year, we continue to focus on driving strong performance across our businesses to continue to be able to improve the health wellbeing, and peace of mind of those we serve. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we continue to expect full-year 2020 consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion, and we continue to expect to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect medical utilization to increase. We expect additional COVID-19 treatment costs, and we expect lower enrollment as well as continued lower net investment income, due to recessionary pressures. Inside in our guidance, we considered a range of scenarios regarding the rate and pace of the return of medical utilization, as well as the rate and pace of the reopening of the U.S. and global economies and subsequent impact on employment and customer levels. Our ability to deliver in a range of scenarios, underscores the strength and diversity of our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs. We will continue to dynamically manage our businesses, ensuring that we are delivering on the fundamentals and meeting our customer's needs, while also continuing to provide financial support to our customers and clients in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full-year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and assumes a full-year of contributions from a group disability and life business, although, we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals and disciplined expense management and deployment of capital. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses, generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with significant capital and financial flexibility. In the second quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of cash flows from operations, due to strong fundamental as well as the timing impact of approximately $900 million of delayed tax payments permitted under the CARES Act. Through the end of second quarter, we also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased $8.3 million shares of stock for $1.5 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. And as of June 30th, we had $1.7 billion of cash available at the parent. Finally, we remain on track to close the sale of our group disability and life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy the share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 43.5% as of June 30th, an improvement of 170 basis points from December 31st of 2019, and we remain on track to return on debt-to-capitalization ratio to the upper 30s by the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and returns on capital. Now to recap, through the exceptionally dynamic and disruptive environment associated with COVID-19, Cigna has remained intensely focused on delivering affordability, predictability, and simplicity for the benefit of our customers, patients, and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to helping create vibrant, diverse, high performing communities, whether through partnerships with our employer, health plan or government clients with our provider partners, or with our customers directly. We've delivered strong fundamental performance this year. We'll also see lower medical costs from deferred care, and we continue to provide financial support to our clients and customers. We expect our strong fundamentals across our diverse portfolio of growth businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment, and as such, we continue to expect 2020 full-year adjusted EPS of $18, $18.60 per share, and remain on track to deliver on our target of $20 to $21 of adjusted earnings per share in 2021. With that, I'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Yes, Ralph. It's Eric. I would note two items as it relates to the fee dynamics; first and most significantly, we had a reclassification of certain revenues that we implemented actually back at the beginning of the year, so effective January 1st. That did not have an impact on the P&L, but it reduced revenues and has an exact offset in lower SG&A as well. So, that's showing up in the comparison of this year versus last year, and second, as you know, we did see some declines in self-funded enrollment, but just think that is consistent with the impact of COVID-19 and the economic environment overall. Yes, Matt. It's Eric. I will give you a couple of perspectives here. As I noted in my prepared remarks, and we saw the decline of 30% to 35% back in April, and utilization is uptick since then. You've called out geography, and that's a really important dimension here is looking at this play out market-by-market and having the local perspective is important, and we're certainly seeing this play out different rates and phases in different geographies. As I noted also in the prepared remarks, we saw June at much closer to normal level of utilization. I'd say our early indicators for July are pretty consistent with June. So, still some impacts moving through different geographies, but at this point, we'd say July looks an awful lot like June. I wouldn't call anything out on that yet, Matt. I think again, our outlook for the full-year does assume some additional utilization coming in the back-half of the year, but I think it'd be too early to say that we've seen anything like that within the second quarter. Hi, Justin. It's Eric. Good morning. So, on the first part of your question for the health services and kind of the pattern of the earning, we just step back, the normal pattern for this business is for income to grow throughout the year, as you know, just reflects the overall utilization patterns, and our efforts to manage the supply chain, and we think that will continue to play out throughout the course of 2020. Now I'll remind you, in 2019, the pattern was a little bit extra weighted towards the back-half of the year just given the timing of the supply chain initiatives. So, when you are comparing 2020 to 2019, you'll see that the impact of that kind of play out to the year. We think of 2020 as being more of a normal pattern this year. We think of 2019 was a little bit backend weighted. So, that'd be the biggest dynamic I'd call out as it relates to the pattern. Now, as it relates to the script volumes, overall, we're executing very well and very much in line with the pattern that we had expected to play itself out. As I noted back at our call a quarter-ago, we did see, or we estimated to be about five million scripts get refilled a little earlier that moved from the second quarter into the first quarter, and since that played out, and additionally we've seen nice utilization within our home delivery pharmacy. There's a lot of benefits to the mail order pharmacy and such for our customers and clients. We've seen that adoption continue to be good, but again, nothing else I'd call out in terms of major dynamics. Frank, this is Eric. With a pattern was with similar in terms of how we progress through time, we would note we saw more of a deferral percentage in the commercial book than what we saw in the Medicare Advantage book, but again, kind of the progression month-to-month has been pretty consistent, just more significant impact in the commercial business. Good morning, Whit. On the leakage, as you termed it, maybe step back the -- I think the way I think about that is we have a kind of spectrum across our different customer segments. So within our Select segment, offering, really think about all of our Select segments as having a comprehensive bundle of our services, so pharmacy, behavioral, disease, and care management et cetera, all tied together with stop loss and administration or in our fully insured product, but to that point, think about the Select segment as being effectively 100% penetrated with our pharmacy offering, as you move into the middle market segment, reasonably high degree of penetration there, but you see more buyers that have smaller cart offerings are purchasing and such we've provided some statistics on this at the past and some of our past Investor Day materials, but think about, you know, a meaningful portion but not all of the middle market is having purchased an integrated offering, which then flows to the PBM, and then that same dynamic holds through in the national segment, it's even more a\u0300 la carte, if you will, in terms of the pieces that are, but the I think about it more along the segment lines than I would around just kind of the funding on it is true that the insured business also carries a high degree of penetration, but I encourage you to think about it by segment Yes, Gary, this is Eric. So we'll take that one on a couple of different dimensions we've talked about there. First of all, stepping back, we expect a loss ratio to be somewhat elevated in the back-half of the year. Think about that as 150 to 200 basis points increase over what we previously would have expected for the second-half of the year. Not dimensioned that off a couple of things. One, we do think that there will be some deferred care utilization and the potential for higher acuity coming back in, and then, two, the ongoing effect of the programs we put in place to reduce co-payments or make care more accessible and affordable within quality drive of some additional utilization. I don't have a precise kind of identification of each of those components, but think about those as the biggest drivers for our outlets over the course of the back-half of the year. On the minimum MLR, as you know it's a three-year calculation for the minimum MLRs for the commercial business. So again, we generally speaking, do have a margin between where we are at and the minimum. Now I would know that we increased our accrual in the second quarter by $95 million, and we've got $175 million on the balance sheet for this as a provision at this point, and so it's something we watch, but would still know that there's across the board. Still a margin there before we did not see any of the impact kind of flows through the bottom-line. Yes, Lance, good morning. So just on the group sales specifically, so first of all, we do expect that transaction to close within the third quarter reminder, we expect $5.3 billion of after-tax proceeds once that transaction closes, so that is coming in, in the relatively near-term. As we've talked about for some time now, we've had a goal of and are committed to obtaining a debt or achieving a debt-to-capital ratio of under 40% by the end of the year. We're driving towards that, and we've committed to deploying a significant amount of the proceeds from the group transaction to share repurchase to offset the dilution, the effect of the not having the group insurance business for a portion of the year. So again, at the most macro level, those are the pieces we're navigating. We do continue to fund significant organic growth; we continue to have capital investments to advance our capabilities, but definitely, we see share repurchase as a really excellent use of capital to drive shareholder value in the near-term, and the last thing I note is just add our recent board meeting, our board increased the share repurchase authorization consistent with our expectation of closing the New York Life transaction later this quarter. And as we sit here today, we have $4.4 billion of share repurchase authority outstanding. Hi, Sarah, it's Eric. Broadly, I wouldn't call out any change in terms of impact. Since again nothing that would rise to being inevitable. With respect to our reserving approaches and policies has been very consistent, because the same team and the same approach to working through those calculations for some time, it served us really pretty well so I wouldn't note anything unusual here. No. Thanks, David, and good morning, A.J. So, on the health services business, again within the segment, I think we've talked about in the past we've got a really diversified book of business here with customers through a variety of channels and players that are helped play on government relationships, some direct programs and the like, we've had a really strong degree of client retention and we've had a high degree of continuity in terms of enrollment within those clients as well. So note in my prepared remarks, we did have a bit of a dip of retail acute scripts, especially earlier in the quarter, but that'd be really the only thing I would call out is particularly impactful. Overall, the enrollment levels within our clients and within our health plan clients have held up quite nicely. Yes, Bob. It's Eric. Good morning. So with respect Prime, we announced the collaboration with Prime last December. We worked quite diligently over the end of the year and through the first quarter to get ready for that when we began servicing that collaboration on April 1st. It's really performed very well and very much consistent with our expectations both in terms of services provided, timing and the volumes and the like such to getting up to a great start. We are delighted to have the relationship there. In terms of specialty, I appreciate you calling out Accredo. Accredo continues to be industry leading capability here, and it does continue to drive growth as we see more and more specialty products and as more and more clinical needs the clients those we serve or both of those things drive an additional growth within Accredo. So again, continued strong growth there as well and that's a real bright spot even in the strong health services results. Yes, Chuck, it's Eric. I will start here. With respect to international if you noted it was a strong result year-to-date. And the segment overall continues to perform really well. We've got as I think you know two platforms within the international business. A global health benefits platform that serves employers and a more individually oriented platform that serves both kind of health and supplemental needs and such. With the employer book of business, I would say globally the dynamics were pretty similar to the dynamics that we talked about in our Integrated Medical segment. So, we saw a deferral, less utilization earlier in the quarter. Some of that's come back over the balance of the quarter. We continue to expect to see a slower recovery in terms of employment levels and the like within this business, but I think of it is having a lot of parallels with the U.S. medical business. On individual business, I think here we saw disruption back in first quarter even in terms of both sales and in terms of claims experience and such. Really seen a lot of that come back in Asia, and our Asian market is already and very much kind of back to normal in a lot of our individually oriented businesses at this point. So again, looking forward from here, we would see a continued strong performance in a business, continued growth trajectory from a growth perspective. David, what else you would like to add here?"

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded. We will begin by turning the conference over to Mr. William McDowell. Please go ahead, Mr. McDowell.\nWilliam McDowell: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I\u2019m Will McDowell, Vice President of Investor Relations. As we begin our call, I would note that we are practicing appropriate social distancing and as such are dialed into today's call from separate locations. I would ask for your patience should we as a result, encounter any technical difficulties. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Palmer, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Eric will cover a number of topics including Cigna's first quarter 2020 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2020. As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively is contained in today's earnings release which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Share on this same basis as our principle measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some Forward-Looking Statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2020 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter we recorded after tax special items netting to a charge of $191 million or $0.51 per share. As detailed in our financial supplement, special items in the first quarter include expenses associated with the previously disclosed early extinguishment of debt, as well as integration and transaction related costs and other matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations in our discussion of financial results. Please note that consistent with past practice when we make prospective comments regarding finance performance, including our full year 2020 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the impact of any future share repurchases, or additional prior year development of medical costs. Also, we disclosed prior year development on both a gross and net basis in our release this morning. Going forward, we will only report this measure on a gross basis consistent with industry practice. Additionally, our outlook for 2020 assumes a full year of earnings from Cigna's group disability and life business. We continue to expect our divestiture of that business to be completed in the third quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks Will and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the unique and unprecedented challenge of COVID-19's global pandemic and the tireless effort of those on the frontline caring for patients in need. At Cigna, we have worked to ensure the health and safety of our customers, patients and collogues and we will continue to partner across the system to lead through this crisis. While the COVID-19 emergency understandably and rightfully dominates much of our focus, we do want to take the advantage of our time together today to provide you with an update on our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2020. Following my comments, Eric will share more detail about our first quarter financial results and expectations for the balance of 2020. Then we'll take your questions. Let's begin by discussing the rapid and decisive steps we've taken to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. From the beginning of this health emergency, we established three primary goals for response efforts, first and foremost, to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe. For customers and patients we've taken steps to remove costs and barriers for testing a treatment, ensure they have access to the medications and expand access to care including through additional telehealth services for medical, behavioral and recently for dental health. For clients, we've leveraged our consultative approach and proactively provided them with support and services they need. This includes serving as trusted advisors for those seeking guidance and how to navigate this dynamic and challenging environment and providing relief for those in financial distress. For our healthcare provider partners, we've given them administrative as well as targeted financial support. Additionally, in partnership with New York Life, we've created the Brave of Heart Fund for the true heroes of the COVID-19 crisis. This fund, with contributions from our respective foundations aims to provide $100 million or more in monetary and other assistance to frontline health care workers, their support teams and the families. We're proud to have taken this action which reinforces the service orientation of both Cigna and New York Life, as we work together on an accelerated basis to bring peace of mind to the brave men and women who are so valiantly serving our communities. Additionally, for 70,000 colleagues around the globe, we've also taken appropriate steps to protect their health and well-being. For example, we are providing premium pay for those essential workers whose jobs continue to be Cigna site dependent. And we're providing 10 additional days of emergency time off to cover absences related to the virus and allow our co-workers to care for themselves and their loved ones during this challenging time. Our second goal in responding to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure that we maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders today and into the future. We know and appreciate the fact that many are depending on us now more than ever, and we need to be there for them in this time of crisis and beyond. We're focused on balancing all of these needs and ensuring we maintain strength of our franchise by continuing to invest in growth, our cape abilities, ongoing innovation and in our talent. Finally, another key goal of our response to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure we are a proactive part of the solution partnering both at national as well as local levels. We've played an active role in driving a high level of collaboration across government, not for profit and private sector organizations in response to this pandemic. While we are proud of our response to date, we will continue to drive our entire organization to give voice to and work for the benefit of our key stakeholders. Now, turning briefly to our results, our first quarter results were strong, consolidated adjusted revenue grew to $38.4 billion and after tax earnings grew to $1.76 billion, including high single digit earnings growth in our Health Service business, which was somewhat ahead of our expectations. Our team achieved these results through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. Now, the strength of our first quarter results driven by the performance of our underlying fundamentals reinforces our confidence that our well positioned diverse Health Service portfolio will again deliver attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020, including strong cash flows. As such, we are reaffirming our full year EPS outlook of $18 to $18. 60. Well, the impact of COVID-19 is still developing, we clearly see headwinds driven by the recession it's causing, including, for example, disenrollment within our commercial customers, both in our Integrated Medical business as well as our Health Service business, as well as some pressure in our Group Disability business. As for medical cost, we expect somewhat offsetting impacts from elevated COVID-19 claims cost and lower medical cost from deferred procedures. We fully recognize this is a dynamic environment. However, we expect the strength of our first quarter to drive us to another strong year for revenue, earnings and free cash flow. All while we continue to invest in and support the needs of our key stakeholders. As we look forward, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted opportunities for improvement in the healthcare system, which we believe will accelerate change in our industry. This evolution is likely to usher in a new call for an embrace of innovative and disruptive solutions, a new wave of broadened partnerships, and a need for even greater levels of differentiated value in the marketplace. At Cigna, we have both the capabilities and orientation to further differentiate ourselves in this rapidly evolving industry. The work we've done to harness the full capabilities following our combination with Express Scripts has positioned us to deliver exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients in an environment that is demanding solutions to health care's most pressing problems. To achieve this, we have deep and broad clinical strength from our medical, behavioral and pharmacy services, and broad data and insight capabilities. In addition, we have substantial financial strength and capital health, aided by our capitalized framework. As we have positioned our company, not to be tied to capital intensive investments in bricks-and-mortar assets or care delivery ownership. This gives us tremendous strategic flexibility and positions us to drive forward with solutions that make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple for those we serve. Our approach is further fueled by our partnership orientation. Recent examples include, MDLIVE and Buoy Health, each of which make it more simple for individuals to access care. With MDLIVE for example, earlier this year Cigna became the first partner to offer virtual care for annual checkups. And as the COVID-19 crisis evolved, we temporarily transferred hundreds of our nurses and physicians to MDLIVE to further expand their capacity. With Buoy Health, in January we harnessed Buoy's capabilities to quickly launch an early intervention tool, which is now available to assess COVID-19 risk for individuals in the US. With this innovative technology, customers can assess their symptoms and make informed decisions about their next steps for care all within the comfort and safety of their homes. MDLIVE and Buoy Health are just two recent examples of our broad portfolio of partnerships around the world. Now to summarize, Cigna's strategic framework provides us with the foundation to respond quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 health emergency, all while we delivered strong first quarter results. We have expanded our services and support for customers, patients, clients, healthcare partners, colleagues and communities. All while continuing to ensure that our company remains well positioned to deliver value whenever and however it is needed, both today and into the future. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing in 2021. Now, none of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our colleagues around the globe. Every day, their commitment and passion embodies our mission to improve the health well-being and peace of mind to those we serve. This has never been more clear and defining than over the last several months, as they've stepped up in countless ways to support the needs of our key stakeholders around the globe at a time when they most need us. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.\nEric Palmer: Thanks David and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the full year inclusive of the impacts and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And although my remarks today will be primarily financially focused, I'd like to acknowledge that in full alignment with Cigna's mission strategy during these uniquely challenging times our company is focused on serving the needs of our customers, our clients and our providers, as well as ensuring the safety of our employees. Now regarding our first quarter consolidated results, a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $38.4 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.76 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 and continued strong operating cash flow of $1.9 billion. Cigna's first quarter results reflect the underlying strength of our businesses and the value we deliver to our customers and clients. Within our business segments, Health Services, Integrated Medical and International, all performed at or somewhat ahead of our expectations. But also note that given the timing of the pandemics onset and progression in the United States, its impact to first quarter results was limited. Overall, Cigna's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses, each of which remains intensely focused on improving the health, well-being and peace of mind for those we serve. Now, as we look to the balance of 2020, I'd start by observing that at Cigna we fully recognize that we are in unprecedented times as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. And I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna's responding with an acceleration of our efforts in the marketplace to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We're partnering across the ecosystem and we are leading in providing resources and services as well as in adapting plan designs to ensure we're meeting those needs. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 outlook for consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion. And to put some additional context around our full year expectations or adjusted earnings per share, I'd remind you that Cigna ended 2019 with considerable strength and momentum across their businesses. And that carried through the first quarter, with strong underlying fundamentals, evident in both results above our previous expectations and in the meaningful amounts of capital we deployed, including ongoing reinvestment for growth, debt repayment, and returns to shareholders through share repurchase. We recognize the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for all businesses and Cigna's no exception. In the first quarter, we saw the onset and incidence of virus begin to ramp globally. But its pace and the diversification of our businesses resulted in a limited impact. Over the balance of this year, we expect headwinds to our performance from the pandemic to include declines in customers across our Commercial Employer and Health Services businesses relative to our prior expectations and some unfavorability in our Group Disability business. Regarding medical costs, we expect higher costs associated with COVID-19 treatment offset by lower levels of utilization related to the deferral of procedures. Now, it's important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's US Commercial customers through self-funding arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients. The quarterly progression of earnings within Integrated Medical will vary somewhat from historical patterns, with lower utilization expected in the second quarter and an expectation of elevated services in the back half of 2020. From an enterprise perspective, I'd highlight that we continue to expect strong volume growth this year in Pharmacy Services, Specialty Pharmacy Care, and in Medicare Advantage, all while we continue to drive overall expense efficiencies. These considerations underscore the strength and diversity in our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs throughout the year. We will continue to invest in innovation and in capabilities to serve our customers and clients and to have the ability to flex to meet their needs. Impacts from COVID-19 to our financial outlook will be influenced by the duration and the extent of the pandemic and the related economic and employment challenges. We will continue to monitor developments related to the pandemic as we progress through the year and are committed to supporting our customers, clients, health care partners and communities that they confront the many challenges this environment presents. To enable our customers and clients to better afford in access care, we are working to customize our solutions and arrangements, as well as leveraging our partnerships with the healthcare delivery system. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would also remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development and also assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management, and deployment of capital, partially offset by pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with financial flexibility, particularly in times of stress. In the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flows from operations. We also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment in the first quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares of stock for $1.1 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. Looking to our liquidity and flexibility, as of March 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash available to the parent. In April, we entered into a term loan for $1.4 billion to further enhance our current liquidity position in light of disruptions in the commercial paper market. We feel very good about the cash flows that our businesses generate and our overall liquidity. And I would also note that we have access to an additional $4.25 billion in committed and untapped revolving lines of credit. Finally, we're on track to close the sale of our Group Disability and Life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy to share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 44.7% as of March 31, down from 45.2% as of December 31 of 2019. And we remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio, the upper 30s at the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from a highly efficient service based orientation to drive strategic flexibility, strong margins, and returns on capital. Now, to recap, against the challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cigna's intensified our focus on delivering exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, providing continuity of services for our customers and clients and working collaboratively with physician partners. We're also doing so while seeking to deliver differentiated sustainable value back to our communities. We ended 2019 with strength across our diversified portfolio of global businesses, which we carried through to a strong first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business are strong and durable, which positions us very well to support our customers, clients, healthcare partners, and communities in this challenged and dynamic environment. Although mix of these contributions is somewhat different, we expect these strong fundamentals across a diverse portfolio of businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment. And as such, we're reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS outlook for 2020 and remain committed to our objective of achieving $20 to $21 of earnings per share in 2021. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Glad to hear everyone's staying safe. Just wanted to ask you're reiterating your outlook for 2021. Clearly, there's a more uncertain economic backdrop today than there was when you originally gave it six months ago. What \u2013 as you think through your business lines, should we assume that that reiteration reflects the fact that you had so much momentum that you got some cushion in the numbers, so even if the economic environment turns out a little tougher, you're okay? Or should we assume that maybe you don't think the business will be impacted that much by the economic environment, can you just flesh out why you're confident in reiterating the 2021 outlook?\nDavid Cordani: A.J., good morning, it's David, good to hear your voice. Hope you and your family are well. So for 2021, to put context first and foremost, you know that we established that target when we announced our combination with Express Scripts over two years ago, and since then we have remained on track to achieve it. We recognize and doubt that the current environment is highly disrupted. Although we believe the goal is both achievable and remains an appropriate target. You're correct. I wouldn't use the word cushion. I would use the word momentum and strength. So we've been able to effectively execute our integration and that remains on track and performing quite strong, the core businesses within our portfolio, our service oriented portfolio with diverse solutions and diverse funding mechanisms to be able to flex in a very dynamic marketplace and environment from that standpoint. And when we look at our performance stepping in through 2020, we consider our first quarter results through and then carry through the month of April. As we look at our results, we believe that target is still appropriate and achievable from that standpoint, I would note clearly inferred in your comment, the biggest wildcard for every industry is the \u2013 would be the depth and breadth and duration of a global recession. So that crystal ball no one has perfectly, but the ballast of our business portfolio and high performing diverse business portfolio gives us confidence that that's the proper target.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice for your question. Our next question is from Gary Taylor with JP Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning, everybody. A few questions, I guess, this one I would stick with, can we go to Healthcare Services segment the 12% growth in the EBITDA there was very strong. Can you give us some sense on how much of that was improvement in synergies, core operations versus some pull forward perhaps from the 2Q because of pre-sales and others?\nEric Palmer: Gary, it's Eric, I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that. So overall, we're really pleased with the performance of the services \u2013 Health Services business in the first quarter. As David noted, a minute ago, we've made really good progress in terms of the transition of the Cigna Life again and continue to work on integration and the like. You referenced kind of the impact of any amounts that were pulled forward and things along those lines. I would note that we had approximately 5 million scripts or 1%, 1.5% of the volume that we ended up having in the first quarter. That was \u2013 we view as being pulled forward from later periods, so we point to that as a relatively modest impact in terms of the impact of the results in the first quarter. And more generally, we just come back to strong results and continued traction in terms of integration program. At last, I would not call out any additional synergies or differences there versus our prior expectations.\nGary Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Mr. Taylor. Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open, sir.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning, David, I was hoping you could expand your thoughts on sort of the lingering or long-term consequences of COVID and just the potential impact and how you see it to your business both in terms of employer appetite or not for risk bearing ASO versus fully insured, that holistic approach that you kind of bring to the market with your suite of products. And then just your positioning and interest in segments of the market like individual or Medicaid or where you've historically been a smaller player. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Ralph. So if we step back, I think one of the perspectives that the current environment reinforces is the power of an importance of the role of the employer. So stepping back, we need to understand the fact that for an employer to have a vibrant business, they need healthy, productive, present highly engaged co-workers. And in some way the crisis actually reinforces the role of the employer in terms of creating a safe environment, but an environment that actually creates a healthy environment and an environment that has a level of productivity and engagement. And I for one I'm just pleased to see how corporations have stepped up relative to co-worker safety, co-worker engagement protocols, even the number of employers that have stepped forward where they had employment dislocation by maintaining continuity of benefits. So point one is we see that is quite important. As it relates to the funding mechanism, I don't see a broad swing. We don't project forwarded broad swing. Having said that, we maintain a diverse portfolio of funding mechanisms and we offer choice for employer clients on a regular basis that has been and that will continue to be a strength, so our ability to have the flexibility we think is quite important, but we don't see this broadly swinging one way or the other from ASO to guarantee costs or vice versa. As it relates to segment expansion, we've positioned our business portfolio to be able to continue to expand, so our Health Service portfolio is really critical strategic expansion. We're offering a broad array of services, both to corporate clients, health plans, governmental entities and increasingly over time, healthcare delivery infrastructures on all sorts of products and programs and services we see as mission critical, so cutting across funding mechanisms up through Medicaid from that standpoint. And then finally, we've systematically expanded our individual business and our biases to do so. And as you'll note, my final comment is from the past, we see over time, the state base risk bearing program or performance based program is an additional growth opportunity for us, if there is high level of clinical engagement, clinical coordination, so we like our positioning. Appreciate the role of the employer, employers are stepping up big in the marketplace today taking care of their employees as best they can and dynamically doing so. And we see for the growth opportunities in our core chassis in our expanded Health Services as well as individual programs.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question is from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Just wanted to \u2013 I have a question and also a follow up. So just first to follow up on A.J's question around 2021, can you talk specifically about the building blocks that are going better, that will offset the potential headwinds to employer growth? And then my question was around share repurchase. You bought a bunch of stock in the first quarter. Can you talk about the turn potentially into April? Can you tell me about the timing of that first of all? And then given that it looks like the repurchase is a little bit bigger than I would have expected. Can you talk about, one, is that a personal purchase that's tied to the \u2013 are you buying back with proceeds that you expect to get from the Disability sale in the third quarter? And anything about a potential pause into repurchase relative to what you were seeing kind of others do out there would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Justin, you have packed a lot in there. So let me take the first and make a qualitative comment on the second, but ask Eric to take the second question. Broadly speaking, we're not going to walk through the detailed building blocks for 2021. We'll do that when we get into providing detailed guidance for 2021. I would ask you to consider going back and looking at the Investor Day walkthrough that Eric provided. And he put forth the building blocks that exists in terms of cross walking us from '19 to '20 to '21 from that standpoint. I'll remind you of a few just as illustrations for the broader audience, right. The impact of deleveraging, we know it, we understand it, it's more within our control versus not the impact of synergies, we know it, we understand it. Our integration program is well in track and well in hand, our impact of capital deployment, before we get into the foundation and fundamental pieces of the equation from that standpoint. And then finally, inverting your comment was the effective disenrollment, two comments. One is what we're seeing thus far and it's just that thus far is both in our Integrated Medical business as well as in our Health Service business. For those corporate employers who have had co-worker dislocation, fully half of those employers are maintaining continuity of benefits, either through the word furlough or by having layoffs, but with benefit continuity, which reinforces an expectation of a more short lived effect, as well as the roles that the employers are playing. And then finally, related to that our health service portfolio gives us a much broader level of services to offer to the marketplace, as opposed to being held to just Integrated Medical sale versus not. The qualitative comment I'd give you on stock repurchases. I hand it over to Eric for more specifics is we recognize the dynamic dynamics of the environment. Just two points, one, our stock repurchase that was done in the first quarter was largely done before the COVID-19 epidemic spiked up intensely in the United States. And secondly, given the unique nature of having a large strategic divestiture, which is what we have for later this year. That is a more unique event where the responsible thing to do is to put that capital back in our shareholders hands largely because it is a unique onetime event from that. But I'll ask Eric to expand a little further on the repo.\nEric Palmer: David, thanks, and Justin, I hope you're doing well. With respect to the share repurchase, as you noted, we did deploy just over a billion dollars over the course of the first quarter. And really think of that as \u2013 back in the framework that I've talked about in terms of our use of capital and touched overall for the year, right. So between the cash flow from operations that we expected to generate, as well as the proceeds from the group divestiture that we expect to close in the third quarter, we talked about having both of those as sources of capital available for deployment and that we would navigate toward year-end debt to capitalization ratio of below 40% and reduce the share count to effectively offset the portion of the year where we don't have the group business so that the impact would be neutral on EPS for the year. And we've got flexibility in navigating through that. And that's the framework in which we deployed the capital in the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Mr. Lake. Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just wondering I guess we can all kind of do the math on how the recession will impact the health benefits side of the business. But I guess if you could talk about the Health Services side a little bit more? It's not 100% clear to me how that business would be expected to perform in a recession, so any color you can give on kind of typical declines in utilization per person during a recession, as well as kind of your overall membership mix within that, how much of that businesses is related to commercial numbers versus serving Medicare or Medicaid numbers for your customers? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, good morning, it's David. Appreciate your question. Broadly speaking, we would see it just in terms of painting a macro picture relative to traditional integrated corporate facing medical and integrated benefits a little less disruptive versus not. Why? Point two is think about that business is serving corporate clients, typically larger corporate clients. Secondly, health plans with diverse portfolios of services from commercial through Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs and then a large government contract. Second, in the services that it provides, those services are somewhat foundational in nature. So the pharmaceutical utilization broadly speaking that individuals need do not change dramatically as a result of a recession. It's not a deferrable event typically from that standpoint, so it has a bit more balance in terms of both the diversity of the client base that exists within it and then the core foundational aspect that comes along with it. As I noted to a prior question, as well, we're seeing in the Health Service space that for those corporate clients, and I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of broader split in a second, for those corporate clients. Those that actually have had a reduction in workforce, fully 50% of them are maintaining benefits on behalf of those individuals. So headline, we see it is a bit less disrupted from a recession versus the traditional business you would think of in terms of measuring it against for the reasons I mentioned. I'll ask Eric to just give you a little bit more color in terms of splits.\nEric Palmer: Yeah, so Kevin, it's Eric. Maybe a couple of things I would add here to David's answer. So first of all, we did provide some statistics in terms of a little bit of a makeup of kind of the distribution of scripts across the different channels and such. In fact, in the Investor Day last year, an order of magnitude about 400 million of the scripts associated with the commercial business, so though a meaningful block of business to be sure, but one of several different components of the book of business that we have within Express Scripts, so pretty well diversified. I think David covered the dynamics in terms of the consistency of the volumes and such for the benefit of our patients and such. I think maybe the last thing I would note is just the positive impacts of mail order that that we experienced in the first quarter and we think will be durable. Yeah, right. So as we've talked about for some time, mail order carries with it a number of benefits, right, better dispensing accuracy. Once you get on mail order, you're more likely to stay with your prescription that helps to keep gaps in care from being remaining open or being open and such. And obviously we've got a quite a leading operation in terms of the home delivery pharmacy. So we feel really good about the ability to use that to help serve our customers as well.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, David and Eric, and thanks for taking the question. David, I'm really intrigued by your comments on the disenrollment thing that hampered maintaining continuity of benefits. I guess, are you able to put any more color around the dynamic of the falling enrollment versus falling medical costs? I guess I'm just trying to think about, obviously, the medical costs seem to keep falling faster. I'm wondering is that the same in the PBM versus the medical business? And then I guess do you have any sense of the permanence of the expectations. I'm trying to figure out if this is the difference of getting laid off and getting six weeks or three months of health care after getting laid off or whether or not employers are looking at this as some type of more permanent setup expecting to bring employees back in the balance of the year. Thanks. I know it's a lot.\nDavid Cordani: Yeah, George, I appreciate it. And it's a bit of a different dynamic that we're confronting on a whole variety basis. So let's maybe unpack that a little bit. First, on the cost side of the equation, headline answer is no. So what I mean by that is, your inference of a falloff in medical costs is that similar to the fall off in pharmacy costs, no, because in furthering your comment is the fall off in medical costs is correlated to the deferrable experiences of medical, there's not a similar one-for-one correlation in pharmacy as relates to fall off. Now, there may be a small amount if there's a deferrable procedure, and there would have been a follow on script of that individual retaking on the back end that procedure, but by and large, I would separate those two as having a different effect in the different impact. Specific to the disenrollment dynamic, put one is what we see is corporations and it's an important pause moment in the United States, corporations we see are really striving to where it all possible, take care of their co-workers and see this as ideally a more temporary dislocation of their business. And hence want to maintain continuity or tethering, meaning ties, positive ties with the co-workers as such fully 50% both in our Integrated Medical and our Health Service business or maintaining benefits with their employees from that standpoint, not with a 30 day timeline currently, obviously, there'll be re-visitations of that from that standpoint, but it's sort of full on expectation of those individual corporations expecting \u2013 fully expecting to bring business back. You'll also note \u2013 bring employees back when the business comes back. You'll also note that part of the Federal narrative right now is around stimulus evolution and regulatory evolution is providing further evaluation of providing further incentives and subsidies to employers beyond the small employer subsidy around the benefit continuity because the data would show that the benefit continuity is better for society at large by keeping people healthy in the first place from the transition standpoint. So point is it's a unique time corporations are reaching I think constructively where at all possible, both large, medium and small where possible to maintain that level of continuity and evolving governmental posture around providing additional incentives or support to be able to do so. Hope that's helpful?\nGeorge Hill: That is, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Hill. Our next question is from Miss. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Ma'am, your line is open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you. Good morning. So when we think about the progression to your point that there's a lot of uncertainty regarding the timing, but if we think about a scenario of second surge and you think about the balance of continued falling in medical costs versus more severe unemployment. Do you still feel comfortable under that type of more bearish scenario in the 2020, in the 2021 numbers that you provided?\nDavid Cordani: Ricky, I appreciate your framing. Clearly there's a lot of scenarios. In close there's uncertainty, so we agree on both. I don't think it's constructive to take multiple different hypothetical's and then try to pinpoint how an individual lever would move within that scenario in a given point in time, but we recognize and I appreciate your framing, there are multiple scenarios that exist. Our view is that is we've played through a variety of scenarios and a variety of sensitivity tests in understanding what we have within our control running our business that the reaffirmation of our EPS as well as our revenue outlook is appropriate for 2020. And as I noted to the prior questions, the leverage we have within our control, as we best understand the environment right now for 2021 that that target is also appropriate and achievable for a corporation from that standpoint. The last thing I would say is the whole notion relative to a second surge or otherwise, we've seen elevated experiences now that society is adjusting to and we would expect to see further adjustments in both clinical protocols, community protocols, the way in which businesses operate from a more flexible standpoint and we would expect to see further accelerated evolution of treatments ideally beginning to be introduced to the market in the second half of this year as well, but having said that, we continue to believe that our outlook for 2020 is an appropriate outlook and a seeable outlook for us.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Miss. Goldwasser. Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.\nRobert Jones: Great, thanks for the questions. I guess just following up on the Health Services segment, the retention rate you guys laid out obviously looks pretty solid as you think about 2021. I'm just curious how this selling season in its early has progressed just given, I can only imagine payers are doing benefit managers or debt payers are dealing with a lot of other distractions right now. So wondering if that's adding to maybe a reluctance to explore switching? And then conversely do you think because of those dynamics that there might be less opportunity this year for net new wins, just given that the retention rates across the board might in fact be higher. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Robert, it's David. So let me frame that in two dimensions, Health Services and then a little bit of walk over to Integrated Medical. But specific Health Services, we're delighted, we're pleased with the strength and we would view the 96% to 98% expectation for retention rate yet again for 2021 to be really, really strong. Now that's delivered with \u2013 as a result of sustained strong service delivery, sustained strong pharmacy cost delivery and ongoing innovation. And wrapping around that the team could be consultative in working with our clients. Specific to that retention rate, I would remind you that first, you should expect that the health plan portfolio business, those renewals largely complete and largely completed before the spike of COVID-19. So I would not correlate that result to a passivity or reluctance of people to evaluate the marketplace. Secondly, the large corporates within that portfolio, also more meaningfully renew on the earlier side of the timeline versus not. Now bridging to your comment, this disruptive environment, I think creates a higher hurdle rate, all other things remaining equal for a corporation or a benefits manager to introduce even more disruption to their world. I think that's a basic solid tenet to take place because of so much disruption. However, we still see business moving and that comment carries from Health Services across the Integrated Medical because at its core, employers in the case of this comment now are still looking for differentiated value and being able to bring them whether it's an innovative offering or a coordinated Health Service offering they can deliver innovative step function value, that affordability, predictability and simplification is even more important today, but all things remain equal. I think your basic tenet is right from this point going forward. In terms of the selling season, there's a bit of a higher hurdle to get across. I just wouldn't draw that conclusion up against the Health Service renewal of 96 to 98% because so much of that was then completed before the spike of the epidemic.\nRobert Jones: Got it, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Jones. Our next question is from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Your line is open, sir.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. Question around the 2020 guidance confirmation here and there were a bunch of positives, including some favorable development, the tax benefits, something in the International around the accounting change, share buybacks et cetera. And yet, I haven't heard anything on the call that talks about pressures from COVID outweighing the benefits from delayed services and things like that and maybe less impact. So I'm just curious, is it just more appropriate to confirm guidance or am I sort of missing something and maybe the economic impact and lost membership we should be considering more seriously.\nDavid Cordani: Hey, Josh, good morning, it's David. I appreciate the way you frame the question. So point one is really strong start to the year. Fundamentals are strong across multiple of our business portfolios. And as in the case in most quarters, there were some items that you could call out is potentially being non-run ratable. Point two, within our International business there was a large favorable item that came through that aided further the strong fundamentals within the business. Having said that, we believe the outlook is both appropriate, achievable and prudent given that we're a bit ahead of our own expectations and the Street's expectations in the first quarter, given the uncertainty that exists in the latter part of the year. So strong fundamentals, top line, bottom line aided by some items that are non-run ratable and take the International item as an example, but added to a strong quarter within International. And as we take it all into consideration, we think it's prudent to maintain our EPS outlook at this point in time, given the uncertainty and potential puts and takes in the second half of the year.\nJosh Raskin: Okay, so nothing specific you would point to as a major headwind.\nDavid Cordani: That is correct, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Raskin. Our next question is from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open, sir.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good to have some unique insights into the impact of COVID on the business for a bit of a more extended period due to your exposures to Asia and some of the key markets that have been impacted there. So interested if you can talk a bit about what you're seeing more recently in some of the Asian businesses as those economies have started to open back up at different levels and specifically just around consumer behaviors, both as they relate to some of the sales trends of your products and then on how you're seeing healthcare utilization sort of track a bit later into \u2013 in some of these markets that have already been experiencing COVID for longer than we have.\nDavid Cordani: Hey, Scott, good morning, it's David. I'll grab that. And if I missed anything, I'll ask Eric to add to. Great question, so stepping back as you articulate we're global Health Service company, so we did have an early look into the COVID-19 dynamic, including our own co-workers in Wuhan. It's a city where we had a meaningful number of co-workers. I highlight two specific learnings that we're able to take starting from that, but not limited to that and carrying it forward. And then I'll give you a little bit on your specific question relative to the medical cost a little bit more difficult. Point one is we're able to learn and everybody's learning how to dynamically flex a global workforce pretty darn rapidly into a work at home environment. But not just a simple work in home environment, a work in home environment with the technology, infrastructure, connectivity and then workflows to keep the execution transpiring not just in terms of the base of the business, but ongoing innovation, some of the creative work that needs to transpire from that standpoint. Second, indisputably, we're able to learn and retest the imperative around public private partnership. In every country we operate in, you see, the public private partnership is being integral to being able to respond to this from worksite management, to workers safety, to testing access, testing protocols, to treatment, to community support, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we saw that in country after country after country, which we'd like to believe that helped us be in position in the United States to be able to expect that proactively reach out for that and engage. As it relates to the medical cost dynamic, we see more of that through our global employer businesses covering the globally mobile population. It's a large business, but it's thin across the globe. So you see really small snippets and bytes of that everywhere, as opposed to a density of that, broadly speaking from that standpoint. And my final comment would be, even in the markets that had the earliest onset we see consumer behavior coming back pretty rapidly, quite rapidly as it relates to the activation of the consumer, from a social interaction standpoint, to the consuming services to the sale process, including your individual sale process. Eric, anything to add?\nEric Palmer: David, I think you hit the headlines pretty effectively there, so nothing else to add at this point.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Scott.\nScott Fidel: Yeah, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Fidel. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open, sir.\nSteve Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, David and Eric, and thanks for taking the question. So similar to many of your managed care peers, you mentioned in your prepared remarks your expectation of lower healthcare utilization in the second quarter, then elevated in the back half of 2020. By using the word elevated, I guess, just to clarify, are you expecting and budgeting for now that overall healthcare utilization would be above historical averages at some point in the back half of this year as there's a catch up of deferred care, or just elevated versus lower 2Q trends and then basically returning back to normal trends from before any COVID-19? I think there's still some mixed views among investors just on the magnitude of healthcare utilization bounce back in the back half of 2020. Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Yeah, Steve, it's Eric. I'll start here. Overall, I think step to recognize this is a bit unprecedented, right. So stepping into this, I think the things we've been looking at here are, one, it's a pretty different set of dynamics across different geographies. So I think understanding the path and approach across different geographies and how this plays out across different geographies. I would just note, I think there'll be variations there. As the COVID impact, certainly been more impactful in some geographies than others. I think that will lead to more disruption in some geographies than in others, so to start with that one. Two, I think we would view that there will be some things that are deferred out of the second quarter, as I noted in my prepared remarks that will come into the back half of the year. Now, I don't think it'll necessarily be one for one. I mean, in terms of all of the things that were deferred from the second quarter are occurring in the third and fourth quarters, but it's appropriate to think of at least some of those coming back in the back half of the year. And as we continue to progress through this, we'll be working to refine our estimates and PTO posted as we think about it. David, I don't know what else you'd add there.\nDavid Cordani: Yeah, I agree with your comments for sure. I would remind you, Steven, specifically for our business, I ask you to remember 85% of our commercial business is ASO. So our employer clients are seeing and aligned with what we're experiencing from that standpoint. And even when you carry that forward to our MA portfolio, today, approximately 85% of our MA customers are in a value based relationship with the healthcare system from that standpoint. And then a final thought is we need to think about the capacity, right, the healthcare systems capacity to either get back to its prior level of utilization service fulfillment versus a massive uptick in that over a short period of time, and I don't mean that in a coded way, we need to recognize the fact that our healthcare delivery system is taxed right now. Different dimensions of it are taxed, but some facilities are redeploying surgeons and otherwise who are not doing deferrable procedures in doing triage procedures or virtual care from that standpoint. So as Eric noted a lot of uncertainty here, but important for us we're aligned with our employer clients, and they'll see the benefits of that aggregate cost experience in the first half of the year and a bit more reversion in the second half of the year based upon the scenarios we're operating with right now.\nSteve Valiquette: Just a very quick follow up on that, I mean, some of your peers have provided ranges on what percent of total medical spend they deem as either non-emergent or elective. Some have also discussed how much that elective care is declining on a percent basis, either in late March or in April. Are you able to share your views on these metrics and trends based on what you're seeing right now?\nEric Palmer: Scott, its Eric, some of our \u2013 some of the most effective markets, you could see care deferrals or reduction in cost of as much as 30% for the first few weeks in April.\nSteve Valiquette: Okay, that's perfect. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mrs. Valiquette. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thank you for taking my questions and good morning. You've commented about certainly kind of COVID slash recession impacting membership and that being one of the variables that you are looking at certainly. I'm wondering if \u2013 to what extent you are already feeling that and if that is a reason for the relatively slow growth in selecting a middle market membership in the first \u2013 here at the end of the first quarter. If that is true or is there another reason in what would that be? Thank you.\nEric Palmer: Okay. Hey, David, it's Eric. I'll start and then ask David if he wants to add anything else on here. And overall, broadly, I wouldn't point to the current COVID pandemic as a driver in terms of the membership results, we reported from a first quarter perspective overall. And again, just stepping back a little bit, we note we're really pleased with the continued customer growth in the Select segment. So on a year-on-year basis up about 10% in terms of now versus where we were a year ago. We've talked about it in a lot of different settings. This is a business that grows continuously throughout the year, right. So we've got pretty consistent growth quarter in quarter out to get good momentum there, I mean, on a year-on-year basis as well you're up a bit in mid market, so it's again, you're pretty consistent performance there. So again I wouldn't point to any disruption in the first quarter actual as we as we think about the pandemic dynamic at any broad scale. David, what else would?\nDavid Cordani: Yeah, the only thing I'd add is \u2013 just reaffirm the point which I think is sometimes maybe lost is the Select segment ramps throughout the course of the year. And we can see the value proposition and the complicated offering we have in that space is resonating quite well.\nDavid Windley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question Mr. Windley. Our last question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Mr. Rhyee, your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, most of my questions have been answered. David, in the beginning, you talked about some of the efforts you're doing particularly in virtual care with MDLIVE and you guys were one of the first to launch a digital formulary for employers to look at and obviously the \u2013 and particularly virtual care has really come to the forefront here as \u2013 obviously, the nation practices social distancing and et cetera. Can you maybe talk about sort of what the interest in uptick of the formulary has been coming I guess, into this year? And then what kind of response you've been able to provide for clients using this in the middle of the pandemic? And the last I guess, related to that when I looked at it, it's really kind of about diabetes care and mental health. Telehealth itself wasn't on it maybe is that a distinction that you kind of make when you're constructing the formulary, any thought there would also be helpful. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Charles. Good morning. Let me try to kind of compartmentalize your question here. So I think you're building a little bit of an off the digital formulary and then you referenced the telehealth services et cetera. So maybe stepping back, the digital formulary was an innovative offering, is an example of one of many innovative offerings I should say, where we're trying to seek to help our clients, meaning corporate customers and health plans as they seek to utilize that as well as our customers in terms of making more informed decisions. So the digital formulary has a specific purpose to take the curate and digital applications that are out there to 300,000 plus and growing and try to evaluate them against specific criteria. More broadly inferred in your statement, which I agree with is society at large has been aggressively ramping appetite for more personalized, simplified, convenient ways of accessing services, information and increasingly care. So with telehealth wasn't that long ago that I think we as a society would be using telehealth as a small slice of triage intervention. And the COVID-19 epidemic is reinforcing to us it could be a larger portion of an overall integrated or coordinated healthcare offering. And we see that as a big part of both today and the future. We like our positioning both partnering as well as having proprietary capabilities. And as I noted, we were the first to offer annual checkups. We brought to market a dental capability, et cetera, around that. And then lastly, just wrapping the example around it, with the Buoy Health capability that we're able to bring to market very rapidly is another way of harnessing both through partnership, but putting the customer or patient front and center and providing an actionable, virtual tool with which to assess oneself and make informed decisions going forward from that standpoint. So big picture is we see a re-envisioning of what we call the front end of care, the way in which individuals access both information as well as the care system as having a tremendous opportunity to harness new technologies, tools and capabilities, which start with virtualization, and carrying that through a part of the coordinated care delivery system. And we like our positioning by not being tethered to or beholden to whether it's bricks-and-mortar or care fulfillment resources that will be in conflict with that. And the appetite right now is high and the satisfaction level from consumers who are experiencing that is quite high. And we think that will grow going forward.\nCharles Rhyee: David, if I could quickly follow up, can you maybe give us a sense on sort of the decision tree in your mind in which of these capabilities that you want to own such as like Buoy Health versus ones that you want to partner with like MDLIVE and I guess particularly telehealth my assumption has been utilization relatively has been until now fairly low. So the decision is easier to say we'd rather partner with somebody doing it, but is there a point when you would even look at telehealth and say this is a capability we want to have in house? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: So fair question, I'd say stay tuned for more, but to give you a little bit of framing relative to it. We do some telehealth today on our own platform, so the Cigna Medical Group out in Arizona today is fulfilling approximately 80% of all our patient experiences today through either telephony or video interaction and less than 20% of their fulfillment is taking place through physical interaction during the COVID environment, so we can see that firsthand. Secondly, we've co-developed telehealth capability with some of our more advanced value based healthcare partners in certain markets, having said that, we have successfully partnered on scale. Bigger picture, expect to see us be oriented around at a minimum, the IP or Intellectual Property, the data, the data management, the data algorithms, the predictive capability to deliver the personalization, the clinical quality, we're going to be more oriented around that and then open architected to own some and then partner with some in very different ways to be able to bring it to the marketplace to offer the respective choice. Hope that helps?\nOperator: Thank you so much for your question Mr. Rhyee. I'll now turn the conference back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining our call today. I want to start by acknowledging again the tireless efforts of all the frontline workers of the COVID-19 crisis for their selfless and caring nature for the patients that they're servicing. From Cigna's perspective, as we lead through this crisis, we will continue to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe, work to maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders both today as well as into the future and ensure that we work to be a proactive part of the solution, partnering in both national and local levels. Relative to our performance, our team achieved strong results in the first quarter, through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand our key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained, attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing this growth in 2021. With that, we thank you for joining the call. We wish you safety and health during these challenging times for both you and your family members and we look forward to future discussions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2020 results review.

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks Will and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. I'd like to begin by acknowledging the unique and unprecedented challenge of COVID-19's global pandemic and the tireless effort of those on the frontline caring for patients in need. At Cigna, we have worked to ensure the health and safety of our customers, patients and collogues and we will continue to partner across the system to lead through this crisis. While the COVID-19 emergency understandably and rightfully dominates much of our focus, we do want to take the advantage of our time together today to provide you with an update on our first quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2020. Following my comments, Eric will share more detail about our first quarter financial results and expectations for the balance of 2020. Then we'll take your questions. Let's begin by discussing the rapid and decisive steps we've taken to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. From the beginning of this health emergency, we established three primary goals for response efforts, first and foremost, to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe. For customers and patients we've taken steps to remove costs and barriers for testing a treatment, ensure they have access to the medications and expand access to care including through additional telehealth services for medical, behavioral and recently for dental health. For clients, we've leveraged our consultative approach and proactively provided them with support and services they need. This includes serving as trusted advisors for those seeking guidance and how to navigate this dynamic and challenging environment and providing relief for those in financial distress. For our healthcare provider partners, we've given them administrative as well as targeted financial support. Additionally, in partnership with New York Life, we've created the Brave of Heart Fund for the true heroes of the COVID-19 crisis. This fund, with contributions from our respective foundations aims to provide $100 million or more in monetary and other assistance to frontline health care workers, their support teams and the families. We're proud to have taken this action which reinforces the service orientation of both Cigna and New York Life, as we work together on an accelerated basis to bring peace of mind to the brave men and women who are so valiantly serving our communities. Additionally, for 70,000 colleagues around the globe, we've also taken appropriate steps to protect their health and well-being. For example, we are providing premium pay for those essential workers whose jobs continue to be Cigna site dependent. And we're providing 10 additional days of emergency time off to cover absences related to the virus and allow our co-workers to care for themselves and their loved ones during this challenging time. Our second goal in responding to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure that we maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders today and into the future. We know and appreciate the fact that many are depending on us now more than ever, and we need to be there for them in this time of crisis and beyond. We're focused on balancing all of these needs and ensuring we maintain strength of our franchise by continuing to invest in growth, our cape abilities, ongoing innovation and in our talent. Finally, another key goal of our response to COVID-19 crisis is to ensure we are a proactive part of the solution partnering both at national as well as local levels. We've played an active role in driving a high level of collaboration across government, not for profit and private sector organizations in response to this pandemic. While we are proud of our response to date, we will continue to drive our entire organization to give voice to and work for the benefit of our key stakeholders. Now, turning briefly to our results, our first quarter results were strong, consolidated adjusted revenue grew to $38.4 billion and after tax earnings grew to $1.76 billion, including high single digit earnings growth in our Health Service business, which was somewhat ahead of our expectations. Our team achieved these results through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. Now, the strength of our first quarter results driven by the performance of our underlying fundamentals reinforces our confidence that our well positioned diverse Health Service portfolio will again deliver attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020, including strong cash flows. As such, we are reaffirming our full year EPS outlook of $18 to $18. 60. Well, the impact of COVID-19 is still developing, we clearly see headwinds driven by the recession it's causing, including, for example, disenrollment within our commercial customers, both in our Integrated Medical business as well as our Health Service business, as well as some pressure in our Group Disability business. As for medical cost, we expect somewhat offsetting impacts from elevated COVID-19 claims cost and lower medical cost from deferred procedures. We fully recognize this is a dynamic environment. However, we expect the strength of our first quarter to drive us to another strong year for revenue, earnings and free cash flow. All while we continue to invest in and support the needs of our key stakeholders. As we look forward, there is no doubt that COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted opportunities for improvement in the healthcare system, which we believe will accelerate change in our industry. This evolution is likely to usher in a new call for an embrace of innovative and disruptive solutions, a new wave of broadened partnerships, and a need for even greater levels of differentiated value in the marketplace. At Cigna, we have both the capabilities and orientation to further differentiate ourselves in this rapidly evolving industry. The work we've done to harness the full capabilities following our combination with Express Scripts has positioned us to deliver exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients in an environment that is demanding solutions to health care's most pressing problems. To achieve this, we have deep and broad clinical strength from our medical, behavioral and pharmacy services, and broad data and insight capabilities. In addition, we have substantial financial strength and capital health, aided by our capitalized framework. As we have positioned our company, not to be tied to capital intensive investments in bricks-and-mortar assets or care delivery ownership. This gives us tremendous strategic flexibility and positions us to drive forward with solutions that make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple for those we serve. Our approach is further fueled by our partnership orientation. Recent examples include, MDLIVE and Buoy Health, each of which make it more simple for individuals to access care. With MDLIVE for example, earlier this year Cigna became the first partner to offer virtual care for annual checkups. And as the COVID-19 crisis evolved, we temporarily transferred hundreds of our nurses and physicians to MDLIVE to further expand their capacity. With Buoy Health, in January we harnessed Buoy's capabilities to quickly launch an early intervention tool, which is now available to assess COVID-19 risk for individuals in the US. With this innovative technology, customers can assess their symptoms and make informed decisions about their next steps for care all within the comfort and safety of their homes. MDLIVE and Buoy Health are just two recent examples of our broad portfolio of partnerships around the world. Now to summarize, Cigna's strategic framework provides us with the foundation to respond quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 health emergency, all while we delivered strong first quarter results. We have expanded our services and support for customers, patients, clients, healthcare partners, colleagues and communities. All while continuing to ensure that our company remains well positioned to deliver value whenever and however it is needed, both today and into the future. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing in 2021. Now, none of this would be possible without the hard work and dedication of our colleagues around the globe. Every day, their commitment and passion embodies our mission to improve the health well-being and peace of mind to those we serve. This has never been more clear and defining than over the last several months, as they've stepped up in countless ways to support the needs of our key stakeholders around the globe at a time when they most need us. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Eric. A.J., good morning, it's David, good to hear your voice. Hope you and your family are well. So for 2021, to put context first and foremost, you know that we established that target when we announced our combination with Express Scripts over two years ago, and since then we have remained on track to achieve it. We recognize and doubt that the current environment is highly disrupted. Although we believe the goal is both achievable and remains an appropriate target. You're correct. I wouldn't use the word cushion. I would use the word momentum and strength. So we've been able to effectively execute our integration and that remains on track and performing quite strong, the core businesses within our portfolio, our service oriented portfolio with diverse solutions and diverse funding mechanisms to be able to flex in a very dynamic marketplace and environment from that standpoint. And when we look at our performance stepping in through 2020, we consider our first quarter results through and then carry through the month of April. As we look at our results, we believe that target is still appropriate and achievable from that standpoint, I would note clearly inferred in your comment, the biggest wildcard for every industry is the \u2013 would be the depth and breadth and duration of a global recession. So that crystal ball no one has perfectly, but the ballast of our business portfolio and high performing diverse business portfolio gives us confidence that that's the proper target. Good morning, Ralph. So if we step back, I think one of the perspectives that the current environment reinforces is the power of an importance of the role of the employer. So stepping back, we need to understand the fact that for an employer to have a vibrant business, they need healthy, productive, present highly engaged co-workers. And in some way the crisis actually reinforces the role of the employer in terms of creating a safe environment, but an environment that actually creates a healthy environment and an environment that has a level of productivity and engagement. And I for one I'm just pleased to see how corporations have stepped up relative to co-worker safety, co-worker engagement protocols, even the number of employers that have stepped forward where they had employment dislocation by maintaining continuity of benefits. So point one is we see that is quite important. As it relates to the funding mechanism, I don't see a broad swing. We don't project forwarded broad swing. Having said that, we maintain a diverse portfolio of funding mechanisms and we offer choice for employer clients on a regular basis that has been and that will continue to be a strength, so our ability to have the flexibility we think is quite important, but we don't see this broadly swinging one way or the other from ASO to guarantee costs or vice versa. As it relates to segment expansion, we've positioned our business portfolio to be able to continue to expand, so our Health Service portfolio is really critical strategic expansion. We're offering a broad array of services, both to corporate clients, health plans, governmental entities and increasingly over time, healthcare delivery infrastructures on all sorts of products and programs and services we see as mission critical, so cutting across funding mechanisms up through Medicaid from that standpoint. And then finally, we've systematically expanded our individual business and our biases to do so. And as you'll note, my final comment is from the past, we see over time, the state base risk bearing program or performance based program is an additional growth opportunity for us, if there is high level of clinical engagement, clinical coordination, so we like our positioning. Appreciate the role of the employer, employers are stepping up big in the marketplace today taking care of their employees as best they can and dynamically doing so. And we see for the growth opportunities in our core chassis in our expanded Health Services as well as individual programs. Justin, you have packed a lot in there. So let me take the first and make a qualitative comment on the second, but ask Eric to take the second question. Broadly speaking, we're not going to walk through the detailed building blocks for 2021. We'll do that when we get into providing detailed guidance for 2021. I would ask you to consider going back and looking at the Investor Day walkthrough that Eric provided. And he put forth the building blocks that exists in terms of cross walking us from '19 to '20 to '21 from that standpoint. I'll remind you of a few just as illustrations for the broader audience, right. The impact of deleveraging, we know it, we understand it, it's more within our control versus not the impact of synergies, we know it, we understand it. Our integration program is well in track and well in hand, our impact of capital deployment, before we get into the foundation and fundamental pieces of the equation from that standpoint. And then finally, inverting your comment was the effective disenrollment, two comments. One is what we're seeing thus far and it's just that thus far is both in our Integrated Medical business as well as in our Health Service business. For those corporate employers who have had co-worker dislocation, fully half of those employers are maintaining continuity of benefits, either through the word furlough or by having layoffs, but with benefit continuity, which reinforces an expectation of a more short lived effect, as well as the roles that the employers are playing. And then finally, related to that our health service portfolio gives us a much broader level of services to offer to the marketplace, as opposed to being held to just Integrated Medical sale versus not. The qualitative comment I'd give you on stock repurchases. I hand it over to Eric for more specifics is we recognize the dynamic dynamics of the environment. Just two points, one, our stock repurchase that was done in the first quarter was largely done before the COVID-19 epidemic spiked up intensely in the United States. And secondly, given the unique nature of having a large strategic divestiture, which is what we have for later this year. That is a more unique event where the responsible thing to do is to put that capital back in our shareholders hands largely because it is a unique onetime event from that. But I'll ask Eric to expand a little further on the repo. Kevin, good morning, it's David. Appreciate your question. Broadly speaking, we would see it just in terms of painting a macro picture relative to traditional integrated corporate facing medical and integrated benefits a little less disruptive versus not. Why? Point two is think about that business is serving corporate clients, typically larger corporate clients. Secondly, health plans with diverse portfolios of services from commercial through Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs and then a large government contract. Second, in the services that it provides, those services are somewhat foundational in nature. So the pharmaceutical utilization broadly speaking that individuals need do not change dramatically as a result of a recession. It's not a deferrable event typically from that standpoint, so it has a bit more balance in terms of both the diversity of the client base that exists within it and then the core foundational aspect that comes along with it. As I noted to a prior question, as well, we're seeing in the Health Service space that for those corporate clients, and I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of broader split in a second, for those corporate clients. Those that actually have had a reduction in workforce, fully 50% of them are maintaining benefits on behalf of those individuals. So headline, we see it is a bit less disrupted from a recession versus the traditional business you would think of in terms of measuring it against for the reasons I mentioned. I'll ask Eric to just give you a little bit more color in terms of splits. Yeah, George, I appreciate it. And it's a bit of a different dynamic that we're confronting on a whole variety basis. So let's maybe unpack that a little bit. First, on the cost side of the equation, headline answer is no. So what I mean by that is, your inference of a falloff in medical costs is that similar to the fall off in pharmacy costs, no, because in furthering your comment is the fall off in medical costs is correlated to the deferrable experiences of medical, there's not a similar one-for-one correlation in pharmacy as relates to fall off. Now, there may be a small amount if there's a deferrable procedure, and there would have been a follow on script of that individual retaking on the back end that procedure, but by and large, I would separate those two as having a different effect in the different impact. Specific to the disenrollment dynamic, put one is what we see is corporations and it's an important pause moment in the United States, corporations we see are really striving to where it all possible, take care of their co-workers and see this as ideally a more temporary dislocation of their business. And hence want to maintain continuity or tethering, meaning ties, positive ties with the co-workers as such fully 50% both in our Integrated Medical and our Health Service business or maintaining benefits with their employees from that standpoint, not with a 30 day timeline currently, obviously, there'll be re-visitations of that from that standpoint, but it's sort of full on expectation of those individual corporations expecting \u2013 fully expecting to bring business back. You'll also note \u2013 bring employees back when the business comes back. You'll also note that part of the Federal narrative right now is around stimulus evolution and regulatory evolution is providing further evaluation of providing further incentives and subsidies to employers beyond the small employer subsidy around the benefit continuity because the data would show that the benefit continuity is better for society at large by keeping people healthy in the first place from the transition standpoint. So point is it's a unique time corporations are reaching I think constructively where at all possible, both large, medium and small where possible to maintain that level of continuity and evolving governmental posture around providing additional incentives or support to be able to do so. Hope that's helpful? Ricky, I appreciate your framing. Clearly there's a lot of scenarios. In close there's uncertainty, so we agree on both. I don't think it's constructive to take multiple different hypothetical's and then try to pinpoint how an individual lever would move within that scenario in a given point in time, but we recognize and I appreciate your framing, there are multiple scenarios that exist. Our view is that is we've played through a variety of scenarios and a variety of sensitivity tests in understanding what we have within our control running our business that the reaffirmation of our EPS as well as our revenue outlook is appropriate for 2020. And as I noted to the prior questions, the leverage we have within our control, as we best understand the environment right now for 2021 that that target is also appropriate and achievable for a corporation from that standpoint. The last thing I would say is the whole notion relative to a second surge or otherwise, we've seen elevated experiences now that society is adjusting to and we would expect to see further adjustments in both clinical protocols, community protocols, the way in which businesses operate from a more flexible standpoint and we would expect to see further accelerated evolution of treatments ideally beginning to be introduced to the market in the second half of this year as well, but having said that, we continue to believe that our outlook for 2020 is an appropriate outlook and a seeable outlook for us. Good morning, Robert, it's David. So let me frame that in two dimensions, Health Services and then a little bit of walk over to Integrated Medical. But specific Health Services, we're delighted, we're pleased with the strength and we would view the 96% to 98% expectation for retention rate yet again for 2021 to be really, really strong. Now that's delivered with \u2013 as a result of sustained strong service delivery, sustained strong pharmacy cost delivery and ongoing innovation. And wrapping around that the team could be consultative in working with our clients. Specific to that retention rate, I would remind you that first, you should expect that the health plan portfolio business, those renewals largely complete and largely completed before the spike of COVID-19. So I would not correlate that result to a passivity or reluctance of people to evaluate the marketplace. Secondly, the large corporates within that portfolio, also more meaningfully renew on the earlier side of the timeline versus not. Now bridging to your comment, this disruptive environment, I think creates a higher hurdle rate, all other things remaining equal for a corporation or a benefits manager to introduce even more disruption to their world. I think that's a basic solid tenet to take place because of so much disruption. However, we still see business moving and that comment carries from Health Services across the Integrated Medical because at its core, employers in the case of this comment now are still looking for differentiated value and being able to bring them whether it's an innovative offering or a coordinated Health Service offering they can deliver innovative step function value, that affordability, predictability and simplification is even more important today, but all things remain equal. I think your basic tenet is right from this point going forward. In terms of the selling season, there's a bit of a higher hurdle to get across. I just wouldn't draw that conclusion up against the Health Service renewal of 96 to 98% because so much of that was then completed before the spike of the epidemic. Hey, Josh, good morning, it's David. I appreciate the way you frame the question. So point one is really strong start to the year. Fundamentals are strong across multiple of our business portfolios. And as in the case in most quarters, there were some items that you could call out is potentially being non-run ratable. Point two, within our International business there was a large favorable item that came through that aided further the strong fundamentals within the business. Having said that, we believe the outlook is both appropriate, achievable and prudent given that we're a bit ahead of our own expectations and the Street's expectations in the first quarter, given the uncertainty that exists in the latter part of the year. So strong fundamentals, top line, bottom line aided by some items that are non-run ratable and take the International item as an example, but added to a strong quarter within International. And as we take it all into consideration, we think it's prudent to maintain our EPS outlook at this point in time, given the uncertainty and potential puts and takes in the second half of the year. That is correct, Josh. Hey, Scott, good morning, it's David. I'll grab that. And if I missed anything, I'll ask Eric to add to. Great question, so stepping back as you articulate we're global Health Service company, so we did have an early look into the COVID-19 dynamic, including our own co-workers in Wuhan. It's a city where we had a meaningful number of co-workers. I highlight two specific learnings that we're able to take starting from that, but not limited to that and carrying it forward. And then I'll give you a little bit on your specific question relative to the medical cost a little bit more difficult. Point one is we're able to learn and everybody's learning how to dynamically flex a global workforce pretty darn rapidly into a work at home environment. But not just a simple work in home environment, a work in home environment with the technology, infrastructure, connectivity and then workflows to keep the execution transpiring not just in terms of the base of the business, but ongoing innovation, some of the creative work that needs to transpire from that standpoint. Second, indisputably, we're able to learn and retest the imperative around public private partnership. In every country we operate in, you see, the public private partnership is being integral to being able to respond to this from worksite management, to workers safety, to testing access, testing protocols, to treatment, to community support, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So we saw that in country after country after country, which we'd like to believe that helped us be in position in the United States to be able to expect that proactively reach out for that and engage. As it relates to the medical cost dynamic, we see more of that through our global employer businesses covering the globally mobile population. It's a large business, but it's thin across the globe. So you see really small snippets and bytes of that everywhere, as opposed to a density of that, broadly speaking from that standpoint. And my final comment would be, even in the markets that had the earliest onset we see consumer behavior coming back pretty rapidly, quite rapidly as it relates to the activation of the consumer, from a social interaction standpoint, to the consuming services to the sale process, including your individual sale process. Eric, anything to add? Thanks, Scott. Yeah, I agree with your comments for sure. I would remind you, Steven, specifically for our business, I ask you to remember 85% of our commercial business is ASO. So our employer clients are seeing and aligned with what we're experiencing from that standpoint. And even when you carry that forward to our MA portfolio, today, approximately 85% of our MA customers are in a value based relationship with the healthcare system from that standpoint. And then a final thought is we need to think about the capacity, right, the healthcare systems capacity to either get back to its prior level of utilization service fulfillment versus a massive uptick in that over a short period of time, and I don't mean that in a coded way, we need to recognize the fact that our healthcare delivery system is taxed right now. Different dimensions of it are taxed, but some facilities are redeploying surgeons and otherwise who are not doing deferrable procedures in doing triage procedures or virtual care from that standpoint. So as Eric noted a lot of uncertainty here, but important for us we're aligned with our employer clients, and they'll see the benefits of that aggregate cost experience in the first half of the year and a bit more reversion in the second half of the year based upon the scenarios we're operating with right now. Yeah, the only thing I'd add is \u2013 just reaffirm the point which I think is sometimes maybe lost is the Select segment ramps throughout the course of the year. And we can see the value proposition and the complicated offering we have in that space is resonating quite well. Charles. Good morning. Let me try to kind of compartmentalize your question here. So I think you're building a little bit of an off the digital formulary and then you referenced the telehealth services et cetera. So maybe stepping back, the digital formulary was an innovative offering, is an example of one of many innovative offerings I should say, where we're trying to seek to help our clients, meaning corporate customers and health plans as they seek to utilize that as well as our customers in terms of making more informed decisions. So the digital formulary has a specific purpose to take the curate and digital applications that are out there to 300,000 plus and growing and try to evaluate them against specific criteria. More broadly inferred in your statement, which I agree with is society at large has been aggressively ramping appetite for more personalized, simplified, convenient ways of accessing services, information and increasingly care. So with telehealth wasn't that long ago that I think we as a society would be using telehealth as a small slice of triage intervention. And the COVID-19 epidemic is reinforcing to us it could be a larger portion of an overall integrated or coordinated healthcare offering. And we see that as a big part of both today and the future. We like our positioning both partnering as well as having proprietary capabilities. And as I noted, we were the first to offer annual checkups. We brought to market a dental capability, et cetera, around that. And then lastly, just wrapping the example around it, with the Buoy Health capability that we're able to bring to market very rapidly is another way of harnessing both through partnership, but putting the customer or patient front and center and providing an actionable, virtual tool with which to assess oneself and make informed decisions going forward from that standpoint. So big picture is we see a re-envisioning of what we call the front end of care, the way in which individuals access both information as well as the care system as having a tremendous opportunity to harness new technologies, tools and capabilities, which start with virtualization, and carrying that through a part of the coordinated care delivery system. And we like our positioning by not being tethered to or beholden to whether it's bricks-and-mortar or care fulfillment resources that will be in conflict with that. And the appetite right now is high and the satisfaction level from consumers who are experiencing that is quite high. And we think that will grow going forward. So fair question, I'd say stay tuned for more, but to give you a little bit of framing relative to it. We do some telehealth today on our own platform, so the Cigna Medical Group out in Arizona today is fulfilling approximately 80% of all our patient experiences today through either telephony or video interaction and less than 20% of their fulfillment is taking place through physical interaction during the COVID environment, so we can see that firsthand. Secondly, we've co-developed telehealth capability with some of our more advanced value based healthcare partners in certain markets, having said that, we have successfully partnered on scale. Bigger picture, expect to see us be oriented around at a minimum, the IP or Intellectual Property, the data, the data management, the data algorithms, the predictive capability to deliver the personalization, the clinical quality, we're going to be more oriented around that and then open architected to own some and then partner with some in very different ways to be able to bring it to the marketplace to offer the respective choice. Hope that helps? Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining our call today. I want to start by acknowledging again the tireless efforts of all the frontline workers of the COVID-19 crisis for their selfless and caring nature for the patients that they're servicing. From Cigna's perspective, as we lead through this crisis, we will continue to attend to the needs of our stakeholders across the globe, work to maintain a healthy organization that is well positioned to deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders both today as well as into the future and ensure that we work to be a proactive part of the solution, partnering in both national and local levels. Relative to our performance, our team achieved strong results in the first quarter, through focused execution of our business strategies and by continuing to expand our key relationships and partnerships and working to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. This fuels our expectations of delivering sustained, attractive top line and bottom line growth in 2020 and continuing this growth in 2021. With that, we thank you for joining the call. We wish you safety and health during these challenging times for both you and your family members and we look forward to future discussions."

            "content": "Thanks David and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll briefly review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, discuss our outlook for the full year inclusive of the impacts and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. And although my remarks today will be primarily financially focused, I'd like to acknowledge that in full alignment with Cigna's mission strategy during these uniquely challenging times our company is focused on serving the needs of our customers, our clients and our providers, as well as ensuring the safety of our employees. Now regarding our first quarter consolidated results, a few key financial highlights include adjusted revenue of $38.4 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.76 billion after tax, adjusted earnings per share of $4.69 and continued strong operating cash flow of $1.9 billion. Cigna's first quarter results reflect the underlying strength of our businesses and the value we deliver to our customers and clients. Within our business segments, Health Services, Integrated Medical and International, all performed at or somewhat ahead of our expectations. But also note that given the timing of the pandemics onset and progression in the United States, its impact to first quarter results was limited. Overall, Cigna's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio of businesses, each of which remains intensely focused on improving the health, well-being and peace of mind for those we serve. Now, as we look to the balance of 2020, I'd start by observing that at Cigna we fully recognize that we are in unprecedented times as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. And I'm proud of the many ways that Cigna's responding with an acceleration of our efforts in the marketplace to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple. We're partnering across the ecosystem and we are leading in providing resources and services as well as in adapting plan designs to ensure we're meeting those needs. Aided by our strong and diverse portfolio of businesses, we're reaffirming our full year 2020 outlook for consolidated adjusted revenues in the range of $154 billion to $156 billion. And to put some additional context around our full year expectations or adjusted earnings per share, I'd remind you that Cigna ended 2019 with considerable strength and momentum across their businesses. And that carried through the first quarter, with strong underlying fundamentals, evident in both results above our previous expectations and in the meaningful amounts of capital we deployed, including ongoing reinvestment for growth, debt repayment, and returns to shareholders through share repurchase. We recognize the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for all businesses and Cigna's no exception. In the first quarter, we saw the onset and incidence of virus begin to ramp globally. But its pace and the diversification of our businesses resulted in a limited impact. Over the balance of this year, we expect headwinds to our performance from the pandemic to include declines in customers across our Commercial Employer and Health Services businesses relative to our prior expectations and some unfavorability in our Group Disability business. Regarding medical costs, we expect higher costs associated with COVID-19 treatment offset by lower levels of utilization related to the deferral of procedures. Now, it's important to note that we serve 85% of Cigna's US Commercial customers through self-funding arrangements. And as such, our medical cost performance is highly aligned with our clients. The quarterly progression of earnings within Integrated Medical will vary somewhat from historical patterns, with lower utilization expected in the second quarter and an expectation of elevated services in the back half of 2020. From an enterprise perspective, I'd highlight that we continue to expect strong volume growth this year in Pharmacy Services, Specialty Pharmacy Care, and in Medicare Advantage, all while we continue to drive overall expense efficiencies. These considerations underscore the strength and diversity in our portfolio of businesses, which continue to deliver solutions directly aligned with marketplace needs throughout the year. We will continue to invest in innovation and in capabilities to serve our customers and clients and to have the ability to flex to meet their needs. Impacts from COVID-19 to our financial outlook will be influenced by the duration and the extent of the pandemic and the related economic and employment challenges. We will continue to monitor developments related to the pandemic as we progress through the year and are committed to supporting our customers, clients, health care partners and communities that they confront the many challenges this environment presents. To enable our customers and clients to better afford in access care, we are working to customize our solutions and arrangements, as well as leveraging our partnerships with the healthcare delivery system. Taken as a whole, we continue to expect full year consolidated adjusted earnings per share in the range of $18 to $18.60. I would also remind you that our financial outlook excludes the impact of future share repurchases and any additional prior year reserve development and also assumes a full year of contributions from our Group Disability and Life business, although we continue to expect our divestiture of that business to close in the third quarter. Overall, these expected results are driven by strong underlying fundamentals, disciplined expense management, and deployment of capital, partially offset by pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, moving to our 2020 capital and liquidity position and outlook, our capital efficient businesses generate a substantial amount of cash flow, which provides us with financial flexibility, particularly in times of stress. In the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of cash flows from operations. We also deployed $1.1 billion to debt repayment in the first quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased 5.9 million shares of stock for $1.1 billion. For 2020, we continue to expect greater than $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. Looking to our liquidity and flexibility, as of March 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash available to the parent. In April, we entered into a term loan for $1.4 billion to further enhance our current liquidity position in light of disruptions in the commercial paper market. We feel very good about the cash flows that our businesses generate and our overall liquidity. And I would also note that we have access to an additional $4.25 billion in committed and untapped revolving lines of credit. Finally, we're on track to close the sale of our Group Disability and Life business in the third quarter, generating $5.3 billion in net proceeds, which we expect to deploy to share repurchase and debt repayment in 2020. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 44.7% as of March 31, down from 45.2% as of December 31 of 2019. And we remain on track to return our debt to capitalization ratio, the upper 30s at the end of 2020. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from a highly efficient service based orientation to drive strategic flexibility, strong margins, and returns on capital. Now, to recap, against the challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cigna's intensified our focus on delivering exceptional value for the benefit of our customers, patients and all of our stakeholders. We're fully committed to ensuring the safety of our employees, providing continuity of services for our customers and clients and working collaboratively with physician partners. We're also doing so while seeking to deliver differentiated sustainable value back to our communities. We ended 2019 with strength across our diversified portfolio of global businesses, which we carried through to a strong first quarter performance. The fundamentals of our business are strong and durable, which positions us very well to support our customers, clients, healthcare partners, and communities in this challenged and dynamic environment. Although mix of these contributions is somewhat different, we expect these strong fundamentals across a diverse portfolio of businesses to enable us to manage through the various impacts of the current environment. And as such, we're reaffirming our full year adjusted EPS outlook for 2020 and remain committed to our objective of achieving $20 to $21 of earnings per share in 2021. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Gary, it's Eric, I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that. So overall, we're really pleased with the performance of the services \u2013 Health Services business in the first quarter. As David noted, a minute ago, we've made really good progress in terms of the transition of the Cigna Life again and continue to work on integration and the like. You referenced kind of the impact of any amounts that were pulled forward and things along those lines. I would note that we had approximately 5 million scripts or 1%, 1.5% of the volume that we ended up having in the first quarter. That was \u2013 we view as being pulled forward from later periods, so we point to that as a relatively modest impact in terms of the impact of the results in the first quarter. And more generally, we just come back to strong results and continued traction in terms of integration program. At last, I would not call out any additional synergies or differences there versus our prior expectations. David, thanks, and Justin, I hope you're doing well. With respect to the share repurchase, as you noted, we did deploy just over a billion dollars over the course of the first quarter. And really think of that as \u2013 back in the framework that I've talked about in terms of our use of capital and touched overall for the year, right. So between the cash flow from operations that we expected to generate, as well as the proceeds from the group divestiture that we expect to close in the third quarter, we talked about having both of those as sources of capital available for deployment and that we would navigate toward year-end debt to capitalization ratio of below 40% and reduce the share count to effectively offset the portion of the year where we don't have the group business so that the impact would be neutral on EPS for the year. And we've got flexibility in navigating through that. And that's the framework in which we deployed the capital in the first quarter. Yeah, so Kevin, it's Eric. Maybe a couple of things I would add here to David's answer. So first of all, we did provide some statistics in terms of a little bit of a makeup of kind of the distribution of scripts across the different channels and such. In fact, in the Investor Day last year, an order of magnitude about 400 million of the scripts associated with the commercial business, so though a meaningful block of business to be sure, but one of several different components of the book of business that we have within Express Scripts, so pretty well diversified. I think David covered the dynamics in terms of the consistency of the volumes and such for the benefit of our patients and such. I think maybe the last thing I would note is just the positive impacts of mail order that that we experienced in the first quarter and we think will be durable. Yeah, right. So as we've talked about for some time, mail order carries with it a number of benefits, right, better dispensing accuracy. Once you get on mail order, you're more likely to stay with your prescription that helps to keep gaps in care from being remaining open or being open and such. And obviously we've got a quite a leading operation in terms of the home delivery pharmacy. So we feel really good about the ability to use that to help serve our customers as well. David, I think you hit the headlines pretty effectively there, so nothing else to add at this point. Yeah, Steve, it's Eric. I'll start here. Overall, I think step to recognize this is a bit unprecedented, right. So stepping into this, I think the things we've been looking at here are, one, it's a pretty different set of dynamics across different geographies. So I think understanding the path and approach across different geographies and how this plays out across different geographies. I would just note, I think there'll be variations there. As the COVID impact, certainly been more impactful in some geographies than others. I think that will lead to more disruption in some geographies than in others, so to start with that one. Two, I think we would view that there will be some things that are deferred out of the second quarter, as I noted in my prepared remarks that will come into the back half of the year. Now, I don't think it'll necessarily be one for one. I mean, in terms of all of the things that were deferred from the second quarter are occurring in the third and fourth quarters, but it's appropriate to think of at least some of those coming back in the back half of the year. And as we continue to progress through this, we'll be working to refine our estimates and PTO posted as we think about it. David, I don't know what else you'd add there. Scott, its Eric, some of our \u2013 some of the most effective markets, you could see care deferrals or reduction in cost of as much as 30% for the first few weeks in April. Okay. Hey, David, it's Eric. I'll start and then ask David if he wants to add anything else on here. And overall, broadly, I wouldn't point to the current COVID pandemic as a driver in terms of the membership results, we reported from a first quarter perspective overall. And again, just stepping back a little bit, we note we're really pleased with the continued customer growth in the Select segment. So on a year-on-year basis up about 10% in terms of now versus where we were a year ago. We've talked about it in a lot of different settings. This is a business that grows continuously throughout the year, right. So we've got pretty consistent growth quarter in quarter out to get good momentum there, I mean, on a year-on-year basis as well you're up a bit in mid market, so it's again, you're pretty consistent performance there. So again I wouldn't point to any disruption in the first quarter actual as we as we think about the pandemic dynamic at any broad scale. David, what else would?"

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, in this conference, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's Fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2022. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. First, as previously disclosed with our Form 8-K filing and investor call on January 24, we announced changes in our segment reporting effective for the fourth quarter of 2021. These changes were made to align with the company's organizational structure as a result of the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses in seven Asia Pacific markets. Effective in the fourth quarter, Cigna's results will be reported through the following three groups: Evernorth, Cigna Healthcare and Corporate and Other Operations. The international businesses that will be divested pending the close of the transaction will now be reported in Other Operations, which is included within Corporate and Other Operations in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. The International Health business to be retained by Cigna will join our U.S. commercial and U.S. government offerings in a new segment called Cigna Healthcare. This segment replaces the prior U.S. Medical segment. Second, regarding our results. In the fourth quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $119 million or $0.36 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency through enhancements to organizational structure and increased use of automation and shared services. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $70 million or $0.21 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends. Also, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. Finally, I would like to announce our intention to host an Investor Day in June where we will discuss our long-term strategic growth and value creation story. We look forward to sharing more details in the coming weeks. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As we step into 2022, our clients, customers and patients continue to face a rapidly changing landscape with new COVID variants, changing testing and treatment protocols and pressures on the global economy. Throughout these challenges, we have remained focused on addressing and balancing the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders. As a result, our 70,000-plus colleagues around the world continue to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and also continue to grow our businesses. Today, I'll share a perspective around our 2021 performance and the sustained growth opportunities we see for our organization in the year ahead. And Brian will provide additional details about our 2021 financial results and our 2022 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started. In 2021, we grew full year adjusted revenues to $174 billion, a second consecutive year of growth above our long-term target. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% and to $20.47, and we returned over $9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we continue to invest in our capabilities to ensure we are positioned for sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. Our growth is and will continue to be fueled by our two high-performing platforms: Evernorth, our health services business, including pharmacy, care, benefits and intelligence services; and Cigna Healthcare, which includes our portfolio of U.S. commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms complement each other through the breadth of their capabilities and the ability to serve multiple buyer groups. Here, we typically lead with either a medical or pharmacy solution and then we build on those relationships by innovating and delivering new services. We have a proven track record with this approach, a diverse, high-performing portfolio of solutions and a sustained commitment to continued innovation to expand that portfolio. Additionally, we are positioned so that accelerated growth in one area can compensate for temporary pressure in another business within our portfolio. We see this as extremely valuable in a dynamic environment. Relative to our 2021 performance, it was a very strong year for Evernorth. We grew adjusted revenues by 14% in 2021 as Evernorth's corporate clients, health plans, governmental agencies and healthcare delivery system partners increasingly recognized the value of our health services, including in our specialty pharmacy business, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment, in our virtual health capabilities, which have been expanded through MDLIVE to include urgent and dermatology care as well as behavioral health services; in our core pharmacy services portfolio, which continues to generate outstanding results for our clients; and we are further broadening our reach through deeper and new partnerships. For Cigna Healthcare, we had sustained growth, leveraging the strength of our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. As we previously discussed, we also experienced elevated medical costs. We had higher claims costs in our commercial insured and stop-loss businesses and continued higher claims from our special enrollment period customers within the individual business. These included the impact of elevated COVID costs for testing treatment of vaccines. The elevated trend continued throughout the year. As a result, our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was 84% for full year 2021. As Brian will discuss in further detail, we took targeted pricing and affordability actions earlier in 2021 for 2022 impact, as we continue to prioritize margin expansion for 2022. As I highlighted earlier, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and EPS outlook and return over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to continue to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities and achieve sustained attractive performance. We see additional opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Evernorth capabilities to respond to three forces that we believe are fundamentally reshaping the future of healthcare. They are pharmacological innovation, the increased recognition of the link between mental and physical health; and third, the growing trend toward alternative sites of care. I'll start by highlighting how Evernorth will lead the way to capitalize on the first trend, pharmacological innovation. New drugs represent one of the most promising areas for medical innovation in the coming years. And we're seeing good dramatic growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and vaccines. These potentially life-saving and life-changing advances also bring intensifying pressures on affordability. This creates significant opportunity for Evernorth to provide customers, patients and clients with the most innovative new therapies in ways that are accessible, affordable and predictable. By 2025, for example, 66 biologic drugs currently in the market will have the patents expire, opening the door for increased biosimilar competition and an increasing opportunity to decrease healthcare spending by an estimated $100 billion. Importantly, this trend is already unfolding in 2022 and will accelerate further in 2023. We are positioned to lead and fully intend to capture a large portion of those savings for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients by combining and coordinating capabilities that include our Accredo capability, which provides differentiated specialty pharmacy care for a number of specific conditions. I'd also highlight that today specialty pharmacy already drives only 1/3 of our Evernorth revenue, and Accredo is one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio. Additionally, leveraging Express Scripts, which draws upon its expertise in delivering improved affordability, leveraging a broad network, supply chain expertise as well as clinical and service capabilities. Managing biologics and specialty drugs is also a priority focus for our Cigna Healthcare business. Last year, we launched an innovative program to leverage biosimilars in the medical benefit that included incentives that improve access for integrated clients and customers. This illustrates just one way we will continue to leverage Evernorth's capabilities to drive greater affordability and value for Cigna Healthcare clients and customers. Evernorth will also continue to grow from the significant demand for more mental health services as well as the rapidly changing access to care models. For example, Evernorth is continuing to expand our virtual care services by leveraging our MDLIVE platform as well as expanding our behavioral care network. We know how important it is for both patients as well as clients. Our Evernorth research reinforces that total healthcare costs decrease when people, who are diagnosed with behavioral conditions receive coordinated, sustained treatment. For Cigna Healthcare in 2022, we expect to drive customer growth in each of our U.S. commercial market segments and grow earnings as we continue executing on our affordability and pricing actions throughout 2022. Additionally, Cigna Healthcare will continue to partner and leverage our Evernorth innovations. For example, we're continuing to expand digital experiences to help our customers connect with the highest performing and most affordable medical care. Our recent approach, we developed for patients diagnosed with orthopedic and musculoskeletal conditions provide highly personalized and actionable information to guide their choices and support improved healthcare outcomes and affordability. In our U.S. government business, as we've noted previously, we are operating in a more competitive environment stepping into 2022. For Cigna, aided by the strength of our broad portfolio, we've prioritized pricing discipline for U.S. government business for 2022. For Medicare Advantage, we will start the year with flat membership. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident in our position to accelerate growth further, as our customer satisfaction metrics are high, our Star's ratings are very strong, and we steadily expanded our addressable market by entering new geographies. In our Individual & Family Plan business, as noted previously, 2021 customers grew meaningfully in part due to the extended special enrollment period. We expect a decline in customers in 2022, in part driven by our product and price positioning that will adjust for the special enrollment surge we saw in 2021. We do continue to view this as an attractive long-term opportunity. And to support that growth, we continue to enter new markets. For 2022, we entered three new states and 93 new counties. With these markets, for example, we have the ability to reach an additional 1.5 million additional customers. In International Health, we are sharpening our focus, and we'll continue developing our services for the globally mobile as well as go deeper into domestic health and health services. One of the key ways we will do this is with innovative partnerships such as Honeysuckle Health, an analytics-driven health service company establishing our joint venture with the nib Group in Australia. Now taken as a whole, 2022 will be another year of attractive growth for our company. our EPS outlook of at least $22.40 and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 12% reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our businesses. Now before I wrap up, I want to reinforce a key aspect of our sustained performance is our positioning strategically to further expand our reach in addressable markets over time. Here, we will leverage organic partnerships and targeted inorganic opportunities to further strengthen our proven growth platforms. We see three areas of continued focus here. First, in U.S. government, we will seek additional growth opportunities and our ability to win in these markets is further enhanced by our current and expanding Evernorth service capabilities. Second, we will further expand our Evernorth service portfolio. This includes, for example, our Evernorth Care capabilities, including virtual, home and behavioral services. And third, in International Health, our decision to divest our Life accident and supplemental benefits business in several markets reinforces our discipline to focus on the health portion of our portfolio. Now to wrap up. Looking back at 2021, our business performed in a dynamic environment. We delivered adjusted EPS of $20.47 and returned over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. 2022 will be another year of growth across our business, and we will continue to invest in innovation to position us for sustained long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter 2021 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2022. Key consolidated financial highlights for full year 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $174 billion or growth of 12% when adjusting for the sale of the Group Disability and Life business. Adjusted earnings of $7 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to $20.47. We delivered these results despite an elevated medical care ratio in the quarter, partly driven by COVID-19-related claims. Our enterprise revenue and EPS results were slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the resilience and breadth of our portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Evernorth. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 15% to $35.1 billion, while adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in specialty pharmacy and retail, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability and deepening of existing relationships. In the quarter, we also continued to increase the level of strategic investments to support ongoing growth of the Evernorth portfolio, such as our Accredo specialty pharmacy, our virtual care platform and our technology, including digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers, while achieving strong revenue and earnings growth above its long-term growth targets. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes the prior U.S. Medical segment plus our retained International Health business. Overall, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, adjusted pretax earnings were $472 million and the medical care ratio was 87%. During the fourth quarter, we experienced elevated medical costs, driven in large part by dynamics related to COVID, including higher testing, treatment and vaccine costs, specifically the higher-than-expected fourth quarter costs are attributable to three primary areas: higher stop-loss claims, particularly in policies with lower attachment points that were triggered by the cumulative impact of COVID and non-COVID costs throughout the year. Continued pressure on our individual business, particularly the special enrollment period customers who were added in mid-2021 and higher claim costs in our commercial insured book. The elevated medical costs were partly offset by better-than-expected net investment income and fee-based specialty contributions, neither of which are reflected in the medical care ratio metric. For full year 2021, we finished with the medical care ratio of 84%. The unfavorable fourth quarter medical costs informed and sharpened our 2022 assumptions. We now expect full year 2022 medical costs to run above the corresponding 2022 baseline at a relative level that is consistent with full year 2021. This 2022 medical cost outlook is now higher than our previous expectations. In specific to stop-loss, we assume the pressure experienced in the fourth quarter will persist in 2022, and we will take appropriate future pricing action as this book of business renews throughout the year. Helping to offset these pressures, as we step into 2022, our targeted pricing actions we've taken in our U.S. Commercial business as we saw claim costs emerge in 2021, higher U.S. commercial enrollment and retention than previously expected in our fee-based business and incremental affordability actions, which I'll elaborate on in just a few moments. Turning to membership; we ended the year with 17.1 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 430,000 customers for the full year. 2021 customer growth was driven by Middle Markets and Select within U.S. commercial, Individual and Medicare Advantage within U.S. government and International Health. Overall, Cigna Healthcare supported and delivered for our customers, clients and partners during a challenging year and is well-positioned to both grow membership and expand margins in 2022. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter adjusted loss was $115 million and now includes positive earnings contributions from our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses held-for-sale pending divestiture. As Ralph noted, during the fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $119 million after tax related to actions to improve our organizational efficiency. These actions will capitalize on our scale and the progress we have made through automation, increased use of digital tools and continued innovation to better enable us to grow and expand in this dynamic marketplace. Overall, Cigna's 2021 results reflect our balanced portfolio and our commitment to accretive capital deployment to augment our organic growth. As we turn to 2022, our affordability initiatives, pricing actions and focus on operating efficiencies will drive income growth and margin expansion in Cigna Healthcare. This performance coupled with continued growth in Evernorth and accretive capital deployment, will drive attractive EPS growth. For the full year 2022 outlook, I'd like to first remind you that our outlook assumes the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of this year. In total for the company, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $177 billion, representing growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact from previously announced divestitures. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. We project an expense ratio in the range of 6.9% to 7.3%, further improving upon our operational efficiency and ensuring continued affordable solutions for our clients and customers. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. I'll now discuss our 2022 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $6.1 billion. This represents growth of about 5% over 2021, within our targeted long-term income growth range, reflecting strong growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy, all while we continue to increase investments in order to drive new innovative solutions to the market. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.9 billion. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business, driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing in order to expand margin. Some key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2022 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2022 growth of at least 575,000 customers with the vast majority coming from an increase in U.S. Commercial fee-based customers. Within our U.S. commercial book, organic customer growth is driven by National, Middle Market and Select Market segments. We expect Medicare Advantage customers to be relatively flat compared to 2021, reflecting the competitive backdrop. And as David shared, we expect a decrease in our individual customers. We expect the 2022 medical care ratio to be in the range of 82% to 83.5%. As I noted earlier, this outlook assumes total medical costs will be above baseline in 2022. Importantly, we are actively managing overall medical costs with a range of affordability actions, including identifying opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care. For example, we focused our eviCore subsidiary on an incorporating site of care review to our existing processes. These improvements encourage the use of non-hospital settings, which can substantially reduce cost for customers while increasing patient satisfaction. This action has contributed to results within our commercial book of business, where we are now seeing fewer than 20% of all knee and hip replacements occurring in an inpatient hospital setting, down from over 75% in 2019. We are also continuing to promote preventive care, the targeted use of virtual care through our MDLIVE subsidiary and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Through these affordability initiatives and our disciplined pricing actions, we expect to expand margins in 2022, while growing our medical customer base. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we increase strategic reinvestment to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2021, we finished the year with $7.2 billion of cash flow from operations. Additionally, we returned over $9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in 2021, a significant increase from 2020. And now framing our capital outlook for 2022. We expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations, up more than $1 billion from 2021, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing business. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion to capital expenditures, an increase from our 2021 CapEx levels. The investments will be heavily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our meaningful quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, a 12% increase on a per share basis. And we expect to use the proceeds from the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses, primarily for share repurchase. Our guidance assumes full year 2022 weighted average shares to be in the range of 308 million to 312 million shares. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2022, we have repurchased 2.5 million shares for $581 million. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Our full year 2021 consolidated results reflect strong contributions from our focused growth platforms, led by Evernorth. Our 2022 outlook reflects meaningful contributions from each of our two largest segments, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, along with accretive capital deployment. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 full year adjusted earnings of at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. Finally, as Ralph noted, we are looking forward to speaking with you in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in June. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just ask your thinking about seasonality for both MLR and adjusted EPS in 2022 relative to 2021 and maybe sort of typical historical seasonality, and just in particular, thinking about the fact that Omicron obviously still having an impact here in the first quarter, likely on the commercial book of business? Then also, as you talked about, given that you're planning to reprice some of the stop-loss business throughout the course of the year, interested in how you're thinking about the sequencing of the MLR over the course of the year as a result of that? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Scott, it's Brian. So I'll start with the seasonality component as it relates to the EPS cadence as well as the MCR. For purposes of what we expect relative to quarterly EPS, the 2021 pattern is actually a reasonable starting point as we think about the 2022 quarterly EPS that will emerge for us. And so more specifically, we would expect a little bit less than half to transpire in the first half of the year. And based on what we're seeing so far in January, the impact of Omicron, et cetera, working its way through our book, there's actually quite a bit of resemblance in terms of January 2022 to 2021, which again reinforces that '21 is a reasonable framework to use in terms of what to expect relative to EPS seasonality. As it relates to MCR, the full year guidance, as I indicated, is between 82% and 83.5% for the Cigna Healthcare book of business. So the midpoint of that, you can view as a reasonable starting point for the first quarter. We would expect to run a little bit below that in the quarter just based on, again, what the early read is here in January, coupled with the pattern we saw last year. So again, think of a little bit less than 50% of the overall EPS in the first half of the year, think of the first quarter MCR being a bit below the midpoint of our full year guide for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to the stop-loss book of business, within the quarter. And importantly, you need to think of this as a full year accumulation product. So what ends up transpiring with this business is over the course of the year, claims are accumulated and then the fourth quarter of the policy period, there's essentially a true-up. And what we had occur in the fourth quarter of this year is particularly the smaller end of our stop-loss book, we had some of the lower attachment points pierced slightly more heavily than we had been anticipating. And so that created round numbers, you can think of it as about $70 million of medical cost pressure in the fourth quarter. Importantly, though, that's an annual number because it reflects the accumulation over the course of the year in 2021. So that $70 million in the fourth quarter is really a full year '21 number. We have assumed that that $70 million pressure will recur in 2022. So we have not assumed that we'll be able to recover that, and that's embedded in our $3.9 billion income guide for Cigna Healthcare. So to the extent we're able to reprice some of the cases with the later effective dates in '22, that could provide some level of upside relative to the $70 million assumption that's embedded in the guidance.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I apologize if I missed the details around this, but just regarding your commercial membership outlook for '22, can you remind us of your assumptions related specifically to potential additional members from the industry shift of Medicaid members to commercial around redeterminations commencing later this year? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Steve, it's Brian. I'll start and then David can add some color. So as I mentioned, we're expecting net customer growth in Cigna Healthcare of at least 575,000 customers in 2022, which we're really pleased with. And it's actually above what we would have expected a few months ago based on stronger-than-expected enrollment and retention. And as I noted, the vast majority of that will come through in the form of fee-based ASO-related customer relationships. Our membership outlook for '22 does not anticipate any growth from Medicaid redeterminations in either the commercial book or the individual book. So as you know, we don't continue to participate in the health plan space today in Medicaid. And therefore, as we think of the impact of redeterminations, it's only upside relative to our customer outlook. We have not modeled anything in terms of benefit in there. Anything you want to voice over, David?\nDavid Cordani: Yes, I would say, as I noted in my prepared remarks, within the commercial segment, we're pleased that our full year outlook for 2022 has growth in each of our three employer subsegments. So we're pleased with the outlook as we start the year, and we're pleased with the outlook for the full year.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nAlbert Rice: Yes. Hi, everybody. Maybe just a comment about your obviously continue to prioritize expanding in the government side. Two aspects to my question. One, is that still primarily on the Medicare side or is there any change in the thought about Medicaid opportunities? I know you've always said the more acute into Medicaid was of interest, but just an update on that. And then, there's been a lot of discussion about - from an organic standpoint, what's happening in the distribution channels for MA. Maybe get your assessment of where the market is today? And is your organic growth strategy taking advantage of maybe distribution channels in a different way than what you've done historically?\nDavid Cordani: A.J., it's David. Specific to the government expansion, stepping back, first, we continue to see the government space as an interesting and attractive growth space for us. We define that as MA individual exchange, we view as part of the government programs as well as Medicaid when we look at the space more broadly. To date, we focused in terms of using our levers and our focus more heavily on MA and on the individual business. In the end, we're pleased to highlight the fact that within our Evernorth service portfolio, our Evernorth service portfolio continues to be able to expand its Medicaid proposition through servicing health plans and other intermediaries. Additionally, as I noted in my prepared remarks, as we expand our Evernorth service capabilities, we see that as a meaningful value creator to MA, to the individual marketplace as well as to the Medicaid marketplace. And we think all of which are going to continue to evolve and be attractive. Specific to the MA distribution channels, no doubt some headlines have been produced relative to a little different dynamic. And our posture coming into 2022 was that 2022 was going to be a bit more dynamic year from an MA standpoint. Hence, we managed our portfolio to reduce our internal expectations of life growth and focus heavily on margin expansion with an eye toward 2022 - 2023's growth being a more accelerated growth environment. And I think we'll see a little bit more shake out relative to some of the channels that are evolving. For us, our channel traction on our retention has been pretty darn reasonable for 2022. We saw less new business growth year-over-year for Medicare Advantage, and we expected to see less new business growth in Medicare Advantage given our product and our pricing position.\nAlbert Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. One question and one clarification. The question is - or maybe they're both clarifications. I just want to go back to the commercial membership growth. I thought Brian had said mostly fee-based ASO. And then David, you had said growth across the segment. So I was just trying to piece together what your outlook was for Select, where you've had really the strongest growth and I would think would lean more towards risk versus fee?\nDavid Cordani: Gary, it's David. Your starting part of your frame is helpful. So when we think about it, we think about National, Regional or Mid and Select. Each of the segments have attractive growth for 2022 with National and Regional having very attractive growth outlook and all being - think about that as all fee-based. Second, to your point, within the Select segment, the Select segment has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us. In any given year, the amount of new business we've written in that segment has varied anywhere between 70% ASO stop-loss and 30% risk to greater than 50% risk and less than 50% ASO stop-loss, it varies. So, we'll continue to write ASO stop-loss within the Select segment, and we'll write some guaranteed cost business in there, no doubt. But the aggregation of all the segments together and the strength of all three segments going to 2022 has a significant portion of our net customer growth being in the fee-based environment.\nGary Taylor: Okay, that makes sense. I'll ask my other clarification offline. Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Sure, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. David, can you give us some update around the PBM on the Evernorth side as we think about 2022 and 2023? So first off, on 2022, did you see any material changes as we think about contracting or programs that you're offering? And then as we think about the selling season for 2023, I know we're pretty early on, but any insights that you can give us as far as renewals, book of business that's up for renewal or how we think about how your PBM is doing?\nDavid Cordani: Sure. So let me start with the '23 selling season and put a backdrop of it. We're pleased with the performance we've carried now over multiple years within that subsegment of Evernorth and 2023 is guiding towards another attractive year for us. As it relates to - when you think about the growth equation you're asking about, we start with retention, we would expect at this point, our retention levels for 2023 to be at or above our 2022 retention levels. So we would see that as an attractive outlook. For 2023 growth, we have an active pipeline, and so we would see net new business adds coming through. And then context for you and our listeners, if you think about that business portfolio over the last several years, we've essentially had a net add of about 20 health plans into our portfolio of services. So positive and continued, I would say, sustained attractive performance. Importantly, in the earlier part of your comments in terms of you said contracts and programs, I think I'd draw your attention back to the programs. A cornerstone part of that business is to continue to innovate programs and services. Said otherwise, it's not just a base PBM or access offering. There's an evolution of programs that you would know is safeguard programs and evolution of safeguard programs that continue to enhance clinical programs and clinical engagement and clinical care coordination leveraging both with Express Scripts has the ability to do what Accredo has the ability to do and increasingly, what we're able to leverage off of some of the Cigna Healthcare capabilities working in both directions off the medical side of the proposition. So expansion of the services using your term programs has been mission-critical. And the final note I would say is our PBM team, as you call it, does a really good job of working client by client, be it a corporate client or in case of health clients to co-collaborate the innovations that work for them. And by doing so, helping them, our clients drive growth, which is mutually beneficial to both organizations. So wrapping up, we see 2023 as being another positive year, both from a retention as well as new business growth standpoint.\nLisa Gill: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask, so you gave us a $70 million number, and it sounds like you're going to reprice fully for that in the stop-loss book. I know in the rest of the - your commercial risk book, you had some issues in 2021, you were repricing some of them in 2022, but not fully. Is there a number that you could share with us that you hope to get back for - in 2022 or 2023 in terms of repricing there so we can think about maybe some of the earnings momentum that we could see ahead as you get those books were priced?\nBrian Evanko: Justin, it's Brian. So I think your question was really specific to the fully insured part of the commercial book of business. And as I noted in my comments, there in the fourth quarter, we saw some elevated medical costs. And all in, you can think of that as also in that same general zone as the stop-loss pressure I mentioned of about $70 million. So the three drivers of the pressure: the stop-loss, the individual exchange and the fully insured that you can think of them as about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the medical care ratio pressure we had relative to our expectations in the quarter. So the fully insured component of that going forward, as David indicated in his comments, we started to see pressure emerge in the second quarter of 2021. If you recall, our second quarter MCR was elevated relative to our expectations. And that began a cycle of margin expansion on this book of business. So we've been repricing over the course of '21 and into '22 with the expectation of expanding margins. As we've talked about before, we don't expect that all to transpire in one year. And so when you look at the Cigna Healthcare income guide for next year - or this year, actually at $3.9 billion, that's up about $300 million from where we ended in 2021. That will improve our margin profile, but it doesn't get us all the way to our target margins in one year. So we have more opportunity in '23 and thereafter for further repricing actions. So in the fully insured book of business, in particular, the sold business so far has revenue yields in excess of cost trends. And you can think of that in the range of 100 to 150 basis points as we step into '22. So we'll get some margin expansion in that portfolio. We'd expect more in '23 as more of the business is repriced.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes, I was hoping you could just comment a little bit more on the competitive prices in Medicare Advantage? And - at what point did you come to realize that those were going to meaningfully impact your enrollment outlook? And just - sorry, just related to that, partly really that if you can maybe give one comment on the advance notice on the 2023 rates we got last night?\nDavid Cordani: Matt, it's David. So specific to the Medicare Advantage environment for 2022, we were mindful of our willingness to trade, if you will, volume for margin as we're establishing our pricing for 2022, earlier in 2021. Did we have perfect insight? Of course, not, but we were mindful of that. To answer your question more specifically, clearly, when the competitive pricing by market became visible as you get ready to step into the annual enrollment period. We were able to look at market by market. And we're able to broadly see, in most markets, our level of benefit in price point positioning, clicking down one to three notches by market. So that gives you a context. And that's in an environment with the local scale with attractive medical cost configuration and with the Star's rating deep into the 80s. So as we looked at that environment, again, we were mindful of what was transpiring. And at that point, we were able to see that there would be more volatility. As I noted before, we saw reasonable retention, a little bit of pressure on retention, but less new business sales that came through. Now specific to your point, it's early, folks are coming through what was posted last night. But big picture, I put the headline number aside, it looks like a little over 4% net yields for the industry. And our assessment of ourselves, when you look at mix, kind of shaking you through, is about 4% yield with an eye for 2023. We view that as a positive, taking our current proposition, taking our current Star's rating, taking our current Net Promoter Score, taking the geographies we've expanded in and our disciplined orientation of stabilizing the environment for 2022. So we're looking forward to a very attractive growth opportunity for the Medicare Advantage portfolio of business in 2023.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'll congratulate Ralph for joining. I want to get back to the comments that you made about the inorganic growth, specifically in the government segment. And I think - and perhaps this is the answer to understanding that there are significant potential synergies with Evernorth for new blocks of business in the government segment. But maybe just help us, what's changed over the last couple of years? What is most attractive for potential targets in your mind? How important is scale - large scale? And do you consider the organization prepared for large-scale M&A at this point? And then lastly, the last big one I think about in the government segment was HealthSpring, that asset, that growth rate hasn't really kept up with the market. So, I'm curious if there are lessons learned or things that you think are different this time around in terms of Cigna operating at a larger scale in the government segment?\nDavid Cordani: When you think about our inorganic priorities. First, our inorganic priorities augment our organic growth and then our disciplined focus to extending and expanding partnerships and then identifying inorganic opportunities. We have four categories, and I'll come to your core point in a second, four categories of focus: furthering our international proposition in key markets on the health space, furthering our U.S. government capabilities, furthering our care delivery and management capabilities more oriented toward the digital, the home, the behavioral side of the equation and then digital and technology support for our organization. As it relates to inorganic opportunities in the government space, I'm not going to call out any one as a priority, there's multiple subsegments. But as we look at inorganic priorities, to your point of scale, we have to conclude that, of course, they're strategically attractive, then we have to conclude they're financially attractive and then we have to conclude that we could essentially close them or create a level of certainty. So within the context of that, we take into consideration all the items in your question. Regulatorily, we recognize the environment is quite fluid right now. From a financial attractiveness, this includes the organizational readiness and our ability to create and capture value, we have to conclude for a larger transaction that the transaction will be accretive in its first full year of operations and generate an attractive ROIC. So that's an important part of the equation for us in terms of the way in which we would approach a transaction from that standpoint. And on a final note, we've built a diverse portfolio within Cigna, demonstrating that our Services portfolio is well positioned for continued growth and then within our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, we have multiple growth levers from Commercial to Government to our International Health capability. So we'll be opportunistic here if we see a significant value creator, but quite disciplined considering points I referenced relative to the strategic value creation - the financial value creation, which we're quite disciplined on and, of course, mindful of the regulatory environment.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. David, I wanted to pull on a thread that you just mentioned in the last comment, which was demand for digital. And I guess I would ask for demand for digital ex-telemedicine. I think before you guys bought ESI, they had started to build a digital formulary. Brian talked about increased investments in technology to drive future growth. So I guess I would talk about, are any of these initiatives material yet, again, ex-telemedicine? So are any of the digital initiatives really moving the needle at the bottom line? And I guess, could you talk about where future capital is going to be deployed to grow and fill out the white space here?\nDavid Cordani: So first, just a calibration point, the digital formulary, you made reference to, transpired as we're combined entities. And I think it's a good reinforcement of innovation. So I agree with you using that as an example of innovation. Two, I do appreciate you broadening the leverage and the value creation of digital beyond, although virtual health is massive beyond that. As we look into the organization, we see significant opportunity to leverage digital capabilities beyond. So I'll cite two examples just to be succinct, one of which I made reference to in terms of supporting our customers and patients with specific, highly personalized, immediately actionable information as they make their personal health decisions around consuming care. And I cited an example in orthopedics and musculoskeletal where there is a significant amount of preference and choice that the consumer patient has exercised. And we've learned over time, delivering information that is personalized and actionable at the moment that matters when decisions are being made is mission-critical, and we're able to improve value for that patient through better quality, better affordability and then share some of that benefit back to the client. So that's an example on the care side of the equation. On the administrative side of the equation, we talked about our ability to harness further leveraging the franchise off of shared services as well as our continued growth of our revenue portfolio. A digital-first framework is mission-critical within that. We have the ability to bring more personalized services on the administrative side of the equation, both to our customers as well as to our physician partners, and most of that lies upon a digital-first philosophy and framework and we continue to invest there. On a final note, some of the CapEx that Brian made reference to goes toward both of these dimensions, whether it's in the care enablement side of the equation or whether it's in the administrative service side of the equation. We see it as a meaningful value creator, and I appreciate you calling that out.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Ricky. Just a couple of really quick questions. One question about the $119 million charge related to the strategic plan to drive operational efficiencies. Curious, what's the expected size of the cost savings, cadence, timing, is that baked into guidance? And then a second question on the MA rate notice. I know you addressed it a couple of times on the call. But just given how strong it was and '22 membership perhaps falling a bit short of expectations starting flat, any implications to competitive dynamics next year? Is your preference for maybe reinvestment into benefit richness or marketing and distribution channel?\nBrian Evanko: Michael, it's Brian. I'll take the first question, and then David can pick up on the Medicare Advantage component. So as we announced this morning, we are taking a charge in the quarter associated with organizational efficiency. And you can think of that the charge amount itself was about $168 million pretax. Over time, that will run rate to a number in the $200 million, $225 million range. And you can expect that, that full run rate will be achieved by 2023. A portion of that will come through in '22. Of course, that won't all drop to the bottom line. A portion of that will be redeployed in the form of more competitive prices and premiums out into the market. And just to give you a little more context there, I talked about automation, digitization. So a piece of this will be essentially removing unnecessary work and some of that will be personnel. There's also a significant piece in here associated with real estate. We made the decision after a couple of years into the pandemic that some sites should be closed permanently and/or some floors restacked, so there's a component here associated with real estate optimization as well. David, do you want to pick up on the Medicare Advantage component?\nDavid Cordani: Sure. And Michael, just transition from Brian's point, I'd point you to the fact that our SG&A ratio for 2021 was a very attractive number and our outlook for 2022 is a further improvement so back to embedded in our outlook as a further improvement to the SG&A ratio. Relative to the Medicare rate notice in the 2023 environment, we view it as just macro positive environment for us to lean into. I think to the core of your question, do we view it negatively or do we have regret relative to our growth posture for 2022 as we look to the rate notice for 2023? My answer to you is yes and no. Clearly, we would like more lives that are sustainable to be able to serve, but we believe being disciplined in this more fluid environment of '21 to '22, what was a better answer and better decision. And I would remind you, we're talking about numbers off of a book of business of about 550,000 lives. So within our portfolio, that's about 10% - 5% of the enterprise revenue, we're able to make those trade-off decisions. Looking to 2023, we see more opportunity, and when we see that opportunity off of our base, we see the opportunity off of our geographic expansion off the last two years, and we see that opportunity being further enabled by the rate environment for 2023; so we're excited by that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Maybe just want to follow up with that and maybe broaden it a little bit to the exchanges as well. I guess I understand when you price for margin, you're going to grow below average, but MA is growing high single digits, you're flat. The exchanges is having one of the best growth rates we're probably going to see and you're down. And in both cases, you're expanding geographies. So the other companies who have talked about conservative pricing are still growing. So I just wanted to see a little bit more if you can talk about both MA and the exchanges as far as what gives you confidence that your products are going to be competitive and be able to grow? And I guess when you think about 2023 growth, are you talking about reacceleration off of flattish or are you talking about getting back to industry-level growth rates in those businesses for next year?\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, appreciate your questions. Two very different markets in two very different market environments. Specifically to the individual exchange environment, our point of view is adding more lives at 0 or negative margin is not a shareholder prudent posture. Two, in a marketplace that is fluid year in, year out, we've been able to prove that as that marketplace is unrelated. Our discipline has played through safe for the special enrollment period that played through in 2021. Our discipline has played through in a net positive way, as we've been able to build more geographies, more focus in geographies and yield a sustainable proposition. But to be very clear, our conclusion is that adding additional lives in a marketplace that's fluid year in, year out, at 0 or negative margin in a capital-intensive subsegment of the marketplace is not prudent. Looking forward, that marketplace will shake itself out as it has in the past, and we see attractive growth off of our existing geographies and new geographies. Relative to Medicare Advantage, your challenge is fair. I don't resist your macro challenge. In fact, we see that as opportunity versus downside relative to us. We've broadened our reach over the last couple of years meaningfully in terms of new MSAs as well as new counties. Our Star performance is deep within the 80s on a sustained basis, and our Net Promoter Score is quite high. So the cornerstone of the value proposition you can play through remains very attractive in the marketplace. I'd remind you that we've only participated in the individual market. And we've recently only participated in the individual HMO and PPO market over the recent vintage. So we looked within and said our strike zone was small, less than 20% of the addressable market. We've expanded that to about 30% of the addressable market. Now we'll continue to grow that over time. So we look at this current environment for both of these businesses, we're in 2022, we're able to be disciplined for both of those businesses and not chase low or 0 margin business and yield attractive revenue and earnings growth for the franchise and put ourselves in a position for what should be a very attractive 2023 for both of those businesses with attractive meaningful, sustainable growth outcomes.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Brian, I just wanted to go back to the MCR guidance for '22. It implies, I think, about 50 to 200 basis points of improvement. You noted utilization now is expected to be above baseline. And I think if I heard you right on the first quarter, MMLR will be up a little bit year-over-year. So could you maybe just talk through the tailwinds that you see over the balance of the year as it relates to MCR?\nBrian Evanko: So I'll do my best to tackle different aspects of that question. And importantly, the guidance is on the Cigna Healthcare basis. So for purposes of comparability, it's important as you go back and look at our historical financials that you're looking at the Cigna Healthcare basis and not the prior U.S. medical basis. But in aggregate, for full year '21, we landed at 84% for the full year MCR. And to your point, the guidance is 82% to 83.5%. So take the midpoint of that, it's 125 basis points of improvement from '21 into '22. So all in, as I mentioned in my comments, and you mentioned in your question, we are expecting the absolute level of medical costs relative to baseline in 2022 to be similar in full year '22 than what we saw in full year '21. And so we were previously assuming that there would be some level of cost abatement in '22. We are no longer assuming that. We think that's a prudent posture to take stepping into 2022 in light of the year that just ended. So as a result of that, the MCR improvement year-over-year is attributable to both our revenue outlook, our affordability actions and some mix of business changes. So to give you a little more specificity there, if you were to decompose the 125 basis points, think of about 75 basis points of that associated with revenue yields in excess of our cost trends, predominantly in U.S. commercial. So as Justin asked earlier about the fully insured book, we are seeing revenue yields in excess of cost trends as well as the other subsegments of that portfolio. We expect about 25 basis points of improvement to come from our Medicare Advantage book, specifically the risk adjuster headwind that we incurred in 2021 will fully unwind here in 2022. We've got a good level of visibility on that. And then, the final 25 basis points is associated with our Individual and Family Plans book, in particular, the special enrollment period live that we described earlier, we expect the level of normalization in the medical care ratio from that book, both from a combination of the pricing actions we took, the improvement in terms of risk adjuster coding in '22, less pent-up demand and some industry-wide risk pool normalization. All of that contributes to about 25 basis points of improvement on the individual and family plans. So you put that all together and you get 125 basis points from the final '21 to the midpoint of our 2022 guide. Those are the big chunks I would encourage you to think about.\nNathan Rich: Thanks. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. Just to follow up on Kevin's question on the exchanges. I guess I wanted to take a little bit more of the short-term orientation about 2022. Obviously, you're working to reprice this business and what remains a pretty competitive and price-sensitive market. So I was hoping you could give us a sense of how much this membership is set the decline in 2022, basically what we're going to see when you report your Q1 results? And then, such - because it's such a big swing factor for 2021, are you expecting this business will be at least breakeven for 2022 within the guidance you're establishing?\nBrian Evanko: Yes, Stephen, it's Brian. I'll start and then if David wants to pick up on any aspects, feel free to jump in here. So we ended the 2021 calendar year with 378,000 lives and as you know, the open enrollment period just ended a few weeks ago. So there's still some dust to settle in terms of who will follow through with first premium payments. We have extended grace periods on some of the customers, et cetera. So pinpointing the exact number is a bit of a challenge for the first quarter. But for the full year, based on how the open enrollment period just ended up, we would expect lives to be down in the range of 20%, 25%. So you can think of the 378 that we ended at year-end '21 coming down by that sort of magnitude by year-end '22. Intra-year, there's likely to be some net attrition. So I won't try to pinpoint the Q1 number, but you can expect it will be down from the year-end number and then we'll see some further attrition over the course of the year. Based on the pricing actions we took, we've seen our competitive position slide down in most geographies. So the renewals that we did get, we were pleased with because the prices are certainly firmer than they were in '21, which gives us good confidence in the margin expansion. And following up on the question that Nathan just asked me, we would expect all-in MCR improvement on this book of business of several hundred basis points when you think of the loss of the special enrollment period lives and the revenue yields that we were able to achieve.\nDavid Cordani: So therefore, margins expanding in the book to your point, not quite at but approaching more reasonably what our target margins are for the book of business, but not quite at that for 2022.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David, I wanted to come back to Medicare Advantage and ask what key levers do you think or what key changes do you need to make in the Medicare Advantage business to enrich benefits for competitive purposes, lower cost structure, in particular, to be profitable or closer to profitable at price points that you're talking about in the current environment? And what might Evernorth - how might you invoke Evernorth to help in that regard?\nDavid Cordani: So Dave, again, let's start with big picture. Big picture, the performance of that book of business as we step into 2022 has a pretty reasonable retention level, retention point is a couple of points below where we would like it to be given the competitive environment, just less new business sales. So from a value proposition for those we are serving today largely off of an individual HMO chassis and increasing off of an individual PPO chassis, the value proposition resonates for those that are consuming our services. But the new business side of the equation a little bit more challenging given the dynamics in the marketplace. I think we always enhance the value proposition. So to the core of your point, I would point toward two areas. One, the ability to continue to accelerate and enhance the collaboration between the pharmacy, the specialty pharmacy and the behavioral subcomponent of the proposition. And two, the ability to further leverage some alternative side of care opportunities for the benefit, in this case, of the senior beneficiary to deliver both better overall affordability and convenience. So you can think about that as alternative side of care being digital, home care or extending the services that could be delivered in a coordinated value-based physician relationship from that standpoint. We see both of those as net additional added value opportunities for both affordability as well as personalization for the individuals we serve. And both of those are enabled through further expansion of Evernorth.\nDavid Windley: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask a question about outlook for the Evernorth PBM sort of business? And had three components here. One, I was interested in the amount of contribution in '21 and the outlook for '22 and beyond from specialty products going generic and how that's impacting margin? Then on a growth end was interested in what's the further upside with respect to potentially penetrating the Cigna book of ASO business? And then lastly, just on Prime Therapeutics, just interested in what the outlook is as far as renewing that contract? Obviously, you've been expanding and deepening your relationship. But just was interested in kind of how we should look at the security of that?\nDavid Cordani: Lance, it's David. You packed a lot into one question. Let us try to touch upon each. I'll take the Prime question. I'll take the upside on the Cigna book, and I'll ask Brian to take the specialty and specialty generic piece of the equation. First, specific to Prime, just at a more macro level, I'm not going to go through detailed renewal situation with the - on the line here. But if you take two steps back, Prime is a great reinforcement of our orientation around partnering. Our health plan business has continued to grow. I referenced previously, we've had net growth in our health plan portfolio of about 20 health plans over the last several years. Specific to Prime, we're proud to be able to serve our Prime both organization, health plans within it and the members. We've been able to expand the relationship and broaden the relationship over time. And importantly, Lance, we co-collaborate and co-innovate with the health plans within Prime to help to drive further growth for them. So we view it as a positive and it's a reinforcement of the meaningful and attractive sustained growth we've had in our health plan portfolio of businesses. As it relates to upside within the Cigna portfolio, we continue to drive leverage between the Cigna Healthcare portfolio and the Evernorth portfolio. For example, our growth recently with UPMC is an example of leverage between the two organizations, where we leverage some of our Cigna Healthcare capabilities within the Evernorth relationship for a strategic long-term partner when we were able to expand the relationship in that way. Specific to your - I think the traditional part of the way you're asking the question, I'll wrap up here, is on the PBM penetration within the Select segment always deemed that to be fully penetrated. Within the Middle Market segment, the level of penetration varies based on client relationship. We see some additional penetration as having been achieved. And then within National Accounts, it's an account by account relationship that is determined. So overall, we're pleased with our current state of penetration for PBM in Cigna Healthcare. It can move a little bit more, but I wouldn't have you look at it as a big barometer of movement rather the leverage of the relationships like a UPMC is a great example of, you're using the word penetration, we'll use the word cross-leverage and cross-value collaboration. Brian, I'd like you take the specialty in specialty generic piece.\nBrian Evanko: Yes. Overall, just kind of big picture, specialty generics and biosimilars are both really important mechanisms to drive affordability for our clients and customers over time, as they drive competition. And that's a really important part of the landscape here. And specialty was a meaningful driver of our results in 2021. And it will be in 2022 in the Evernorth space. So, well, I won't specifically size the contributions from specialty generics. It was helpful contributor over a multiyear period now to our ultimate P&L for Evernorth. And as we step into '22, I mentioned in my prepared comments, specialty will drive revenue growth in Evernorth. All in, we would expect our Evernorth growth to be within our long-term targeted growth range, meaning at least 4% revenue growth, powered heavily by specialty. Specialty Generics will be a part of that as will biosimilars and other parts of the drug space. So all in, we would expect Evernorth revenue to grow at least 4% for the coming year, and we expect income growth of 5% with Specialty Generics being a component of that.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next and last question comes from Mr. John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, good morning. Thanks for going a little long, team Cigna. The question I have is if - I know you guys aren't breaking out COVID costs anymore, but if we were to assume more of a normal cost, not trend, but just a cost reset in '23, could you please give a ZIP Code for what that would mean quantitatively?\nBrian Evanko: John, it's Brian. So you're right. We found it increasingly difficult to try to segregate COVID and non-COVID and the commentary we had earlier in '21 about COVID headwinds, particularly as you're finding more and more situations where an individual might be admitted to the hospital with one condition and then found to have COVID later on or the situation with our special enrollment period lives, what it was tough to determine is that a COVID-related issue or not. So we found it increasingly difficult, which is why we talk about all-in medical costs relative to the baseline. As I mentioned earlier, for full year '21, we ran above the baseline persistently for all four quarters across the book, and we've carried that assumption forward into 2022. And so you should think of that as, when I say above the baseline, not 1% above the baseline, but a few percentage points above the baseline. So think of low single digit to mid-single digit above the baseline. And then over time, if there's some moderation, that will provide tailwind relative to our '22 and/or subsequent outlook.\nJohn Ransom: And then this is one for David. I mean just strategically, I get to help out our benefit committee and betting vendors and things like that. And so we've been going through this cycle and what strikes me - and we're a pretty large ASO plan, what strikes me is what we're hearing from the consultants that we use as everybody is hot on using these navigators and I know you know they are. And so we're talking about like yet another overlay to sit on top of the PPO, which now needs to become a TPA, so you can steer and then there's quality information. We changed the number on the back of the card. So we're calling the navigator. And the reaction from our management was, gosh, it looks like it could save some money, but why do we need yet another layer on top? Why are the health plans not able to do this with all the reserves and IT and everything that they have it? So I'm just curious, you're a large ASO player. I just wonder what your thought is long-term about supplanting that function? Or do you think that's just - we're just going to add yet another function on top so that we can take three points out of the cost trend?\nDavid Cordani: Yes. Efficient work, John, you grabbed another question there. I think your question points toward the criticality of sustained innovation. And if you - as I know you do, if you go back and look at the space over the last couple of decades, there continues to be periods of time where specialists will take a slice of the value proposition. And I don't say that as being an immaterial or on an important size of the value proposition, but we'll take a slice of the value proposition and try to drive super specialization within that. Typically, what that results in is either consolidation of those capabilities or accelerate innovation of those capabilities to be coordinated. So we don't think the picture you articulate is sustainable. We don't think your coworkers want to have multiple touch points coordinating them. We don't think medical professionals want multiple touch points coordinating them. But rather, the theme of a navigator is totally on strategy for us. We have generations of that within our portfolio, within different solutions that have been in the marketplace for quite some time. One guy capability and certain clinical team capabilities and certain service capabilities, and having a digital-first philosophy, which is what I discussed previously, would reinforce to you that we continue to not only expand programs but expand the capabilities on a digital-first standpoint that could be able to do the navigation for our customers in a much more coordinated way. So we view that as on strategy, we view that as part of our CapEx, we view it as part of our capabilities within our portfolio and we have multiple positive proof points of how we've been able to convert that today, but we do not view that as an opportunity for the marketplace to disintermediate over a long period of time because that fragmentation is not sustainable; so opportunity for us.\nJohn Ransom: See, David, if I hadn't snuck in that question, you wouldn't have been able to give that answer. So I know you're happy with it.\nDavid Cordani: I appreciate your effectiveness, John. You have a great day.\nJohn Ransom: All right. Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: See you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: John reinforces that the operators suggestions are guidelines. But John, I do appreciate it very much. We want to thank everyone for your questions and importantly, your time this morning. And before I wrap up, I just have a couple of comments. First, I want to say how appreciative and proud I am of our more than 70,000 colleagues for continuing to serve our clients, our customers and patients in a very challenging environment. We've all gained an even greater appreciation of the importance of health and well-being during this prolonged pandemic. And in Cigna, we're committed to continuing to innovate to deliver more affordability, simplicity and predictability of solutions for our customers, our patients and our clients. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are well positioned for sustained growth, and we're confident that 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Fourth Quarter 2021 Results Review.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter 2021 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2022. Key consolidated financial highlights for full year 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $174 billion or growth of 12% when adjusting for the sale of the Group Disability and Life business. Adjusted earnings of $7 billion after-tax and adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% to $20.47. We delivered these results despite an elevated medical care ratio in the quarter, partly driven by COVID-19-related claims. Our enterprise revenue and EPS results were slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the resilience and breadth of our portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Evernorth. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Fourth quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 15% to $35.1 billion, while adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.6 billion. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in specialty pharmacy and retail, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability and deepening of existing relationships. In the quarter, we also continued to increase the level of strategic investments to support ongoing growth of the Evernorth portfolio, such as our Accredo specialty pharmacy, our virtual care platform and our technology, including digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered a strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers, while achieving strong revenue and earnings growth above its long-term growth targets. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes the prior U.S. Medical segment plus our retained International Health business. Overall, fourth quarter adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, adjusted pretax earnings were $472 million and the medical care ratio was 87%. During the fourth quarter, we experienced elevated medical costs, driven in large part by dynamics related to COVID, including higher testing, treatment and vaccine costs, specifically the higher-than-expected fourth quarter costs are attributable to three primary areas: higher stop-loss claims, particularly in policies with lower attachment points that were triggered by the cumulative impact of COVID and non-COVID costs throughout the year. Continued pressure on our individual business, particularly the special enrollment period customers who were added in mid-2021 and higher claim costs in our commercial insured book. The elevated medical costs were partly offset by better-than-expected net investment income and fee-based specialty contributions, neither of which are reflected in the medical care ratio metric. For full year 2021, we finished with the medical care ratio of 84%. The unfavorable fourth quarter medical costs informed and sharpened our 2022 assumptions. We now expect full year 2022 medical costs to run above the corresponding 2022 baseline at a relative level that is consistent with full year 2021. This 2022 medical cost outlook is now higher than our previous expectations. In specific to stop-loss, we assume the pressure experienced in the fourth quarter will persist in 2022, and we will take appropriate future pricing action as this book of business renews throughout the year. Helping to offset these pressures, as we step into 2022, our targeted pricing actions we've taken in our U.S. Commercial business as we saw claim costs emerge in 2021, higher U.S. commercial enrollment and retention than previously expected in our fee-based business and incremental affordability actions, which I'll elaborate on in just a few moments. Turning to membership; we ended the year with 17.1 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 430,000 customers for the full year. 2021 customer growth was driven by Middle Markets and Select within U.S. commercial, Individual and Medicare Advantage within U.S. government and International Health. Overall, Cigna Healthcare supported and delivered for our customers, clients and partners during a challenging year and is well-positioned to both grow membership and expand margins in 2022. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter adjusted loss was $115 million and now includes positive earnings contributions from our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses held-for-sale pending divestiture. As Ralph noted, during the fourth quarter, we reported a special item charge of $119 million after tax related to actions to improve our organizational efficiency. These actions will capitalize on our scale and the progress we have made through automation, increased use of digital tools and continued innovation to better enable us to grow and expand in this dynamic marketplace. Overall, Cigna's 2021 results reflect our balanced portfolio and our commitment to accretive capital deployment to augment our organic growth. As we turn to 2022, our affordability initiatives, pricing actions and focus on operating efficiencies will drive income growth and margin expansion in Cigna Healthcare. This performance coupled with continued growth in Evernorth and accretive capital deployment, will drive attractive EPS growth. For the full year 2022 outlook, I'd like to first remind you that our outlook assumes the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of this year. In total for the company, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $177 billion, representing growth of approximately 4%, excluding the impact from previously announced divestitures. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $6.95 billion or at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. We project an expense ratio in the range of 6.9% to 7.3%, further improving upon our operational efficiency and ensuring continued affordable solutions for our clients and customers. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 22% to 22.5%. I'll now discuss our 2022 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $6.1 billion. This represents growth of about 5% over 2021, within our targeted long-term income growth range, reflecting strong growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy, all while we continue to increase investments in order to drive new innovative solutions to the market. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.9 billion. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business, driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing in order to expand margin. Some key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2022 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2022 growth of at least 575,000 customers with the vast majority coming from an increase in U.S. Commercial fee-based customers. Within our U.S. commercial book, organic customer growth is driven by National, Middle Market and Select Market segments. We expect Medicare Advantage customers to be relatively flat compared to 2021, reflecting the competitive backdrop. And as David shared, we expect a decrease in our individual customers. We expect the 2022 medical care ratio to be in the range of 82% to 83.5%. As I noted earlier, this outlook assumes total medical costs will be above baseline in 2022. Importantly, we are actively managing overall medical costs with a range of affordability actions, including identifying opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care. For example, we focused our eviCore subsidiary on an incorporating site of care review to our existing processes. These improvements encourage the use of non-hospital settings, which can substantially reduce cost for customers while increasing patient satisfaction. This action has contributed to results within our commercial book of business, where we are now seeing fewer than 20% of all knee and hip replacements occurring in an inpatient hospital setting, down from over 75% in 2019. We are also continuing to promote preventive care, the targeted use of virtual care through our MDLIVE subsidiary and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Through these affordability initiatives and our disciplined pricing actions, we expect to expand margins in 2022, while growing our medical customer base. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we increase strategic reinvestment to support long-term growth and innovation. In 2021, we finished the year with $7.2 billion of cash flow from operations. Additionally, we returned over $9 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase in 2021, a significant increase from 2020. And now framing our capital outlook for 2022. We expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations, up more than $1 billion from 2021, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing business. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion to capital expenditures, an increase from our 2021 CapEx levels. The investments will be heavily focused on technology to drive future growth. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our meaningful quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share, a 12% increase on a per share basis. And we expect to use the proceeds from the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits businesses, primarily for share repurchase. Our guidance assumes full year 2022 weighted average shares to be in the range of 308 million to 312 million shares. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2022, we have repurchased 2.5 million shares for $581 million. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Our full year 2021 consolidated results reflect strong contributions from our focused growth platforms, led by Evernorth. Our 2022 outlook reflects meaningful contributions from each of our two largest segments, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, along with accretive capital deployment. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2022 full year adjusted earnings of at least $22.40 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. Finally, as Ralph noted, we are looking forward to speaking with you in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day in June. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Scott, it's Brian. So I'll start with the seasonality component as it relates to the EPS cadence as well as the MCR. For purposes of what we expect relative to quarterly EPS, the 2021 pattern is actually a reasonable starting point as we think about the 2022 quarterly EPS that will emerge for us. And so more specifically, we would expect a little bit less than half to transpire in the first half of the year. And based on what we're seeing so far in January, the impact of Omicron, et cetera, working its way through our book, there's actually quite a bit of resemblance in terms of January 2022 to 2021, which again reinforces that '21 is a reasonable framework to use in terms of what to expect relative to EPS seasonality. As it relates to MCR, the full year guidance, as I indicated, is between 82% and 83.5% for the Cigna Healthcare book of business. So the midpoint of that, you can view as a reasonable starting point for the first quarter. We would expect to run a little bit below that in the quarter just based on, again, what the early read is here in January, coupled with the pattern we saw last year. So again, think of a little bit less than 50% of the overall EPS in the first half of the year, think of the first quarter MCR being a bit below the midpoint of our full year guide for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to the stop-loss book of business, within the quarter. And importantly, you need to think of this as a full year accumulation product. So what ends up transpiring with this business is over the course of the year, claims are accumulated and then the fourth quarter of the policy period, there's essentially a true-up. And what we had occur in the fourth quarter of this year is particularly the smaller end of our stop-loss book, we had some of the lower attachment points pierced slightly more heavily than we had been anticipating. And so that created round numbers, you can think of it as about $70 million of medical cost pressure in the fourth quarter. Importantly, though, that's an annual number because it reflects the accumulation over the course of the year in 2021. So that $70 million in the fourth quarter is really a full year '21 number. We have assumed that that $70 million pressure will recur in 2022. So we have not assumed that we'll be able to recover that, and that's embedded in our $3.9 billion income guide for Cigna Healthcare. So to the extent we're able to reprice some of the cases with the later effective dates in '22, that could provide some level of upside relative to the $70 million assumption that's embedded in the guidance. Steve, it's Brian. I'll start and then David can add some color. So as I mentioned, we're expecting net customer growth in Cigna Healthcare of at least 575,000 customers in 2022, which we're really pleased with. And it's actually above what we would have expected a few months ago based on stronger-than-expected enrollment and retention. And as I noted, the vast majority of that will come through in the form of fee-based ASO-related customer relationships. Our membership outlook for '22 does not anticipate any growth from Medicaid redeterminations in either the commercial book or the individual book. So as you know, we don't continue to participate in the health plan space today in Medicaid. And therefore, as we think of the impact of redeterminations, it's only upside relative to our customer outlook. We have not modeled anything in terms of benefit in there. Anything you want to voice over, David? Justin, it's Brian. So I think your question was really specific to the fully insured part of the commercial book of business. And as I noted in my comments, there in the fourth quarter, we saw some elevated medical costs. And all in, you can think of that as also in that same general zone as the stop-loss pressure I mentioned of about $70 million. So the three drivers of the pressure: the stop-loss, the individual exchange and the fully insured that you can think of them as about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the medical care ratio pressure we had relative to our expectations in the quarter. So the fully insured component of that going forward, as David indicated in his comments, we started to see pressure emerge in the second quarter of 2021. If you recall, our second quarter MCR was elevated relative to our expectations. And that began a cycle of margin expansion on this book of business. So we've been repricing over the course of '21 and into '22 with the expectation of expanding margins. As we've talked about before, we don't expect that all to transpire in one year. And so when you look at the Cigna Healthcare income guide for next year - or this year, actually at $3.9 billion, that's up about $300 million from where we ended in 2021. That will improve our margin profile, but it doesn't get us all the way to our target margins in one year. So we have more opportunity in '23 and thereafter for further repricing actions. So in the fully insured book of business, in particular, the sold business so far has revenue yields in excess of cost trends. And you can think of that in the range of 100 to 150 basis points as we step into '22. So we'll get some margin expansion in that portfolio. We'd expect more in '23 as more of the business is repriced. Michael, it's Brian. I'll take the first question, and then David can pick up on the Medicare Advantage component. So as we announced this morning, we are taking a charge in the quarter associated with organizational efficiency. And you can think of that the charge amount itself was about $168 million pretax. Over time, that will run rate to a number in the $200 million, $225 million range. And you can expect that, that full run rate will be achieved by 2023. A portion of that will come through in '22. Of course, that won't all drop to the bottom line. A portion of that will be redeployed in the form of more competitive prices and premiums out into the market. And just to give you a little more context there, I talked about automation, digitization. So a piece of this will be essentially removing unnecessary work and some of that will be personnel. There's also a significant piece in here associated with real estate. We made the decision after a couple of years into the pandemic that some sites should be closed permanently and/or some floors restacked, so there's a component here associated with real estate optimization as well. David, do you want to pick up on the Medicare Advantage component? So I'll do my best to tackle different aspects of that question. And importantly, the guidance is on the Cigna Healthcare basis. So for purposes of comparability, it's important as you go back and look at our historical financials that you're looking at the Cigna Healthcare basis and not the prior U.S. medical basis. But in aggregate, for full year '21, we landed at 84% for the full year MCR. And to your point, the guidance is 82% to 83.5%. So take the midpoint of that, it's 125 basis points of improvement from '21 into '22. So all in, as I mentioned in my comments, and you mentioned in your question, we are expecting the absolute level of medical costs relative to baseline in 2022 to be similar in full year '22 than what we saw in full year '21. And so we were previously assuming that there would be some level of cost abatement in '22. We are no longer assuming that. We think that's a prudent posture to take stepping into 2022 in light of the year that just ended. So as a result of that, the MCR improvement year-over-year is attributable to both our revenue outlook, our affordability actions and some mix of business changes. So to give you a little more specificity there, if you were to decompose the 125 basis points, think of about 75 basis points of that associated with revenue yields in excess of our cost trends, predominantly in U.S. commercial. So as Justin asked earlier about the fully insured book, we are seeing revenue yields in excess of cost trends as well as the other subsegments of that portfolio. We expect about 25 basis points of improvement to come from our Medicare Advantage book, specifically the risk adjuster headwind that we incurred in 2021 will fully unwind here in 2022. We've got a good level of visibility on that. And then, the final 25 basis points is associated with our Individual and Family Plans book, in particular, the special enrollment period live that we described earlier, we expect the level of normalization in the medical care ratio from that book, both from a combination of the pricing actions we took, the improvement in terms of risk adjuster coding in '22, less pent-up demand and some industry-wide risk pool normalization. All of that contributes to about 25 basis points of improvement on the individual and family plans. So you put that all together and you get 125 basis points from the final '21 to the midpoint of our 2022 guide. Those are the big chunks I would encourage you to think about. Yes, Stephen, it's Brian. I'll start and then if David wants to pick up on any aspects, feel free to jump in here. So we ended the 2021 calendar year with 378,000 lives and as you know, the open enrollment period just ended a few weeks ago. So there's still some dust to settle in terms of who will follow through with first premium payments. We have extended grace periods on some of the customers, et cetera. So pinpointing the exact number is a bit of a challenge for the first quarter. But for the full year, based on how the open enrollment period just ended up, we would expect lives to be down in the range of 20%, 25%. So you can think of the 378 that we ended at year-end '21 coming down by that sort of magnitude by year-end '22. Intra-year, there's likely to be some net attrition. So I won't try to pinpoint the Q1 number, but you can expect it will be down from the year-end number and then we'll see some further attrition over the course of the year. Based on the pricing actions we took, we've seen our competitive position slide down in most geographies. So the renewals that we did get, we were pleased with because the prices are certainly firmer than they were in '21, which gives us good confidence in the margin expansion. And following up on the question that Nathan just asked me, we would expect all-in MCR improvement on this book of business of several hundred basis points when you think of the loss of the special enrollment period lives and the revenue yields that we were able to achieve. Yes. Overall, just kind of big picture, specialty generics and biosimilars are both really important mechanisms to drive affordability for our clients and customers over time, as they drive competition. And that's a really important part of the landscape here. And specialty was a meaningful driver of our results in 2021. And it will be in 2022 in the Evernorth space. So, well, I won't specifically size the contributions from specialty generics. It was helpful contributor over a multiyear period now to our ultimate P&L for Evernorth. And as we step into '22, I mentioned in my prepared comments, specialty will drive revenue growth in Evernorth. All in, we would expect our Evernorth growth to be within our long-term targeted growth range, meaning at least 4% revenue growth, powered heavily by specialty. Specialty Generics will be a part of that as will biosimilars and other parts of the drug space. So all in, we would expect Evernorth revenue to grow at least 4% for the coming year, and we expect income growth of 5% with Specialty Generics being a component of that. John, it's Brian. So you're right. We found it increasingly difficult to try to segregate COVID and non-COVID and the commentary we had earlier in '21 about COVID headwinds, particularly as you're finding more and more situations where an individual might be admitted to the hospital with one condition and then found to have COVID later on or the situation with our special enrollment period lives, what it was tough to determine is that a COVID-related issue or not. So we found it increasingly difficult, which is why we talk about all-in medical costs relative to the baseline. As I mentioned earlier, for full year '21, we ran above the baseline persistently for all four quarters across the book, and we've carried that assumption forward into 2022. And so you should think of that as, when I say above the baseline, not 1% above the baseline, but a few percentage points above the baseline. So think of low single digit to mid-single digit above the baseline. And then over time, if there's some moderation, that will provide tailwind relative to our '22 and/or subsequent outlook."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. As we step into 2022, our clients, customers and patients continue to face a rapidly changing landscape with new COVID variants, changing testing and treatment protocols and pressures on the global economy. Throughout these challenges, we have remained focused on addressing and balancing the evolving needs of all of our stakeholders. As a result, our 70,000-plus colleagues around the world continue to deliver differentiated value for those we serve and also continue to grow our businesses. Today, I'll share a perspective around our 2021 performance and the sustained growth opportunities we see for our organization in the year ahead. And Brian will provide additional details about our 2021 financial results and our 2022 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. With that, let's get started. In 2021, we grew full year adjusted revenues to $174 billion, a second consecutive year of growth above our long-term target. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% and to $20.47, and we returned over $9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, we continue to invest in our capabilities to ensure we are positioned for sustained growth in 2022 and beyond. Our growth is and will continue to be fueled by our two high-performing platforms: Evernorth, our health services business, including pharmacy, care, benefits and intelligence services; and Cigna Healthcare, which includes our portfolio of U.S. commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms complement each other through the breadth of their capabilities and the ability to serve multiple buyer groups. Here, we typically lead with either a medical or pharmacy solution and then we build on those relationships by innovating and delivering new services. We have a proven track record with this approach, a diverse, high-performing portfolio of solutions and a sustained commitment to continued innovation to expand that portfolio. Additionally, we are positioned so that accelerated growth in one area can compensate for temporary pressure in another business within our portfolio. We see this as extremely valuable in a dynamic environment. Relative to our 2021 performance, it was a very strong year for Evernorth. We grew adjusted revenues by 14% in 2021 as Evernorth's corporate clients, health plans, governmental agencies and healthcare delivery system partners increasingly recognized the value of our health services, including in our specialty pharmacy business, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment, in our virtual health capabilities, which have been expanded through MDLIVE to include urgent and dermatology care as well as behavioral health services; in our core pharmacy services portfolio, which continues to generate outstanding results for our clients; and we are further broadening our reach through deeper and new partnerships. For Cigna Healthcare, we had sustained growth, leveraging the strength of our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. As we previously discussed, we also experienced elevated medical costs. We had higher claims costs in our commercial insured and stop-loss businesses and continued higher claims from our special enrollment period customers within the individual business. These included the impact of elevated COVID costs for testing treatment of vaccines. The elevated trend continued throughout the year. As a result, our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was 84% for full year 2021. As Brian will discuss in further detail, we took targeted pricing and affordability actions earlier in 2021 for 2022 impact, as we continue to prioritize margin expansion for 2022. As I highlighted earlier, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and EPS outlook and return over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders. Looking forward to 2022, we expect to continue to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities and achieve sustained attractive performance. We see additional opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Evernorth capabilities to respond to three forces that we believe are fundamentally reshaping the future of healthcare. They are pharmacological innovation, the increased recognition of the link between mental and physical health; and third, the growing trend toward alternative sites of care. I'll start by highlighting how Evernorth will lead the way to capitalize on the first trend, pharmacological innovation. New drugs represent one of the most promising areas for medical innovation in the coming years. And we're seeing good dramatic growth in specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies and vaccines. These potentially life-saving and life-changing advances also bring intensifying pressures on affordability. This creates significant opportunity for Evernorth to provide customers, patients and clients with the most innovative new therapies in ways that are accessible, affordable and predictable. By 2025, for example, 66 biologic drugs currently in the market will have the patents expire, opening the door for increased biosimilar competition and an increasing opportunity to decrease healthcare spending by an estimated $100 billion. Importantly, this trend is already unfolding in 2022 and will accelerate further in 2023. We are positioned to lead and fully intend to capture a large portion of those savings for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients by combining and coordinating capabilities that include our Accredo capability, which provides differentiated specialty pharmacy care for a number of specific conditions. I'd also highlight that today specialty pharmacy already drives only 1/3 of our Evernorth revenue, and Accredo is one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio. Additionally, leveraging Express Scripts, which draws upon its expertise in delivering improved affordability, leveraging a broad network, supply chain expertise as well as clinical and service capabilities. Managing biologics and specialty drugs is also a priority focus for our Cigna Healthcare business. Last year, we launched an innovative program to leverage biosimilars in the medical benefit that included incentives that improve access for integrated clients and customers. This illustrates just one way we will continue to leverage Evernorth's capabilities to drive greater affordability and value for Cigna Healthcare clients and customers. Evernorth will also continue to grow from the significant demand for more mental health services as well as the rapidly changing access to care models. For example, Evernorth is continuing to expand our virtual care services by leveraging our MDLIVE platform as well as expanding our behavioral care network. We know how important it is for both patients as well as clients. Our Evernorth research reinforces that total healthcare costs decrease when people, who are diagnosed with behavioral conditions receive coordinated, sustained treatment. For Cigna Healthcare in 2022, we expect to drive customer growth in each of our U.S. commercial market segments and grow earnings as we continue executing on our affordability and pricing actions throughout 2022. Additionally, Cigna Healthcare will continue to partner and leverage our Evernorth innovations. For example, we're continuing to expand digital experiences to help our customers connect with the highest performing and most affordable medical care. Our recent approach, we developed for patients diagnosed with orthopedic and musculoskeletal conditions provide highly personalized and actionable information to guide their choices and support improved healthcare outcomes and affordability. In our U.S. government business, as we've noted previously, we are operating in a more competitive environment stepping into 2022. For Cigna, aided by the strength of our broad portfolio, we've prioritized pricing discipline for U.S. government business for 2022. For Medicare Advantage, we will start the year with flat membership. Looking forward to 2023, we are confident in our position to accelerate growth further, as our customer satisfaction metrics are high, our Star's ratings are very strong, and we steadily expanded our addressable market by entering new geographies. In our Individual & Family Plan business, as noted previously, 2021 customers grew meaningfully in part due to the extended special enrollment period. We expect a decline in customers in 2022, in part driven by our product and price positioning that will adjust for the special enrollment surge we saw in 2021. We do continue to view this as an attractive long-term opportunity. And to support that growth, we continue to enter new markets. For 2022, we entered three new states and 93 new counties. With these markets, for example, we have the ability to reach an additional 1.5 million additional customers. In International Health, we are sharpening our focus, and we'll continue developing our services for the globally mobile as well as go deeper into domestic health and health services. One of the key ways we will do this is with innovative partnerships such as Honeysuckle Health, an analytics-driven health service company establishing our joint venture with the nib Group in Australia. Now taken as a whole, 2022 will be another year of attractive growth for our company. our EPS outlook of at least $22.40 and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 12% reinforces the sustained growth and strength of our businesses. Now before I wrap up, I want to reinforce a key aspect of our sustained performance is our positioning strategically to further expand our reach in addressable markets over time. Here, we will leverage organic partnerships and targeted inorganic opportunities to further strengthen our proven growth platforms. We see three areas of continued focus here. First, in U.S. government, we will seek additional growth opportunities and our ability to win in these markets is further enhanced by our current and expanding Evernorth service capabilities. Second, we will further expand our Evernorth service portfolio. This includes, for example, our Evernorth Care capabilities, including virtual, home and behavioral services. And third, in International Health, our decision to divest our Life accident and supplemental benefits business in several markets reinforces our discipline to focus on the health portion of our portfolio. Now to wrap up. Looking back at 2021, our business performed in a dynamic environment. We delivered adjusted EPS of $20.47 and returned over $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchase. 2022 will be another year of growth across our business, and we will continue to invest in innovation to position us for sustained long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Yes, I would say, as I noted in my prepared remarks, within the commercial segment, we're pleased that our full year outlook for 2022 has growth in each of our three employer subsegments. So we're pleased with the outlook as we start the year, and we're pleased with the outlook for the full year. A.J., it's David. Specific to the government expansion, stepping back, first, we continue to see the government space as an interesting and attractive growth space for us. We define that as MA individual exchange, we view as part of the government programs as well as Medicaid when we look at the space more broadly. To date, we focused in terms of using our levers and our focus more heavily on MA and on the individual business. In the end, we're pleased to highlight the fact that within our Evernorth service portfolio, our Evernorth service portfolio continues to be able to expand its Medicaid proposition through servicing health plans and other intermediaries. Additionally, as I noted in my prepared remarks, as we expand our Evernorth service capabilities, we see that as a meaningful value creator to MA, to the individual marketplace as well as to the Medicaid marketplace. And we think all of which are going to continue to evolve and be attractive. Specific to the MA distribution channels, no doubt some headlines have been produced relative to a little different dynamic. And our posture coming into 2022 was that 2022 was going to be a bit more dynamic year from an MA standpoint. Hence, we managed our portfolio to reduce our internal expectations of life growth and focus heavily on margin expansion with an eye toward 2022 - 2023's growth being a more accelerated growth environment. And I think we'll see a little bit more shake out relative to some of the channels that are evolving. For us, our channel traction on our retention has been pretty darn reasonable for 2022. We saw less new business growth year-over-year for Medicare Advantage, and we expected to see less new business growth in Medicare Advantage given our product and our pricing position. Gary, it's David. Your starting part of your frame is helpful. So when we think about it, we think about National, Regional or Mid and Select. Each of the segments have attractive growth for 2022 with National and Regional having very attractive growth outlook and all being - think about that as all fee-based. Second, to your point, within the Select segment, the Select segment has been and continues to be a very attractive growth segment for us. In any given year, the amount of new business we've written in that segment has varied anywhere between 70% ASO stop-loss and 30% risk to greater than 50% risk and less than 50% ASO stop-loss, it varies. So, we'll continue to write ASO stop-loss within the Select segment, and we'll write some guaranteed cost business in there, no doubt. But the aggregation of all the segments together and the strength of all three segments going to 2022 has a significant portion of our net customer growth being in the fee-based environment. Sure, thanks. Sure. So let me start with the '23 selling season and put a backdrop of it. We're pleased with the performance we've carried now over multiple years within that subsegment of Evernorth and 2023 is guiding towards another attractive year for us. As it relates to - when you think about the growth equation you're asking about, we start with retention, we would expect at this point, our retention levels for 2023 to be at or above our 2022 retention levels. So we would see that as an attractive outlook. For 2023 growth, we have an active pipeline, and so we would see net new business adds coming through. And then context for you and our listeners, if you think about that business portfolio over the last several years, we've essentially had a net add of about 20 health plans into our portfolio of services. So positive and continued, I would say, sustained attractive performance. Importantly, in the earlier part of your comments in terms of you said contracts and programs, I think I'd draw your attention back to the programs. A cornerstone part of that business is to continue to innovate programs and services. Said otherwise, it's not just a base PBM or access offering. There's an evolution of programs that you would know is safeguard programs and evolution of safeguard programs that continue to enhance clinical programs and clinical engagement and clinical care coordination leveraging both with Express Scripts has the ability to do what Accredo has the ability to do and increasingly, what we're able to leverage off of some of the Cigna Healthcare capabilities working in both directions off the medical side of the proposition. So expansion of the services using your term programs has been mission-critical. And the final note I would say is our PBM team, as you call it, does a really good job of working client by client, be it a corporate client or in case of health clients to co-collaborate the innovations that work for them. And by doing so, helping them, our clients drive growth, which is mutually beneficial to both organizations. So wrapping up, we see 2023 as being another positive year, both from a retention as well as new business growth standpoint. Matt, it's David. So specific to the Medicare Advantage environment for 2022, we were mindful of our willingness to trade, if you will, volume for margin as we're establishing our pricing for 2022, earlier in 2021. Did we have perfect insight? Of course, not, but we were mindful of that. To answer your question more specifically, clearly, when the competitive pricing by market became visible as you get ready to step into the annual enrollment period. We were able to look at market by market. And we're able to broadly see, in most markets, our level of benefit in price point positioning, clicking down one to three notches by market. So that gives you a context. And that's in an environment with the local scale with attractive medical cost configuration and with the Star's rating deep into the 80s. So as we looked at that environment, again, we were mindful of what was transpiring. And at that point, we were able to see that there would be more volatility. As I noted before, we saw reasonable retention, a little bit of pressure on retention, but less new business sales that came through. Now specific to your point, it's early, folks are coming through what was posted last night. But big picture, I put the headline number aside, it looks like a little over 4% net yields for the industry. And our assessment of ourselves, when you look at mix, kind of shaking you through, is about 4% yield with an eye for 2023. We view that as a positive, taking our current proposition, taking our current Star's rating, taking our current Net Promoter Score, taking the geographies we've expanded in and our disciplined orientation of stabilizing the environment for 2022. So we're looking forward to a very attractive growth opportunity for the Medicare Advantage portfolio of business in 2023. When you think about our inorganic priorities. First, our inorganic priorities augment our organic growth and then our disciplined focus to extending and expanding partnerships and then identifying inorganic opportunities. We have four categories, and I'll come to your core point in a second, four categories of focus: furthering our international proposition in key markets on the health space, furthering our U.S. government capabilities, furthering our care delivery and management capabilities more oriented toward the digital, the home, the behavioral side of the equation and then digital and technology support for our organization. As it relates to inorganic opportunities in the government space, I'm not going to call out any one as a priority, there's multiple subsegments. But as we look at inorganic priorities, to your point of scale, we have to conclude that, of course, they're strategically attractive, then we have to conclude they're financially attractive and then we have to conclude that we could essentially close them or create a level of certainty. So within the context of that, we take into consideration all the items in your question. Regulatorily, we recognize the environment is quite fluid right now. From a financial attractiveness, this includes the organizational readiness and our ability to create and capture value, we have to conclude for a larger transaction that the transaction will be accretive in its first full year of operations and generate an attractive ROIC. So that's an important part of the equation for us in terms of the way in which we would approach a transaction from that standpoint. And on a final note, we've built a diverse portfolio within Cigna, demonstrating that our Services portfolio is well positioned for continued growth and then within our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, we have multiple growth levers from Commercial to Government to our International Health capability. So we'll be opportunistic here if we see a significant value creator, but quite disciplined considering points I referenced relative to the strategic value creation - the financial value creation, which we're quite disciplined on and, of course, mindful of the regulatory environment. So first, just a calibration point, the digital formulary, you made reference to, transpired as we're combined entities. And I think it's a good reinforcement of innovation. So I agree with you using that as an example of innovation. Two, I do appreciate you broadening the leverage and the value creation of digital beyond, although virtual health is massive beyond that. As we look into the organization, we see significant opportunity to leverage digital capabilities beyond. So I'll cite two examples just to be succinct, one of which I made reference to in terms of supporting our customers and patients with specific, highly personalized, immediately actionable information as they make their personal health decisions around consuming care. And I cited an example in orthopedics and musculoskeletal where there is a significant amount of preference and choice that the consumer patient has exercised. And we've learned over time, delivering information that is personalized and actionable at the moment that matters when decisions are being made is mission-critical, and we're able to improve value for that patient through better quality, better affordability and then share some of that benefit back to the client. So that's an example on the care side of the equation. On the administrative side of the equation, we talked about our ability to harness further leveraging the franchise off of shared services as well as our continued growth of our revenue portfolio. A digital-first framework is mission-critical within that. We have the ability to bring more personalized services on the administrative side of the equation, both to our customers as well as to our physician partners, and most of that lies upon a digital-first philosophy and framework and we continue to invest there. On a final note, some of the CapEx that Brian made reference to goes toward both of these dimensions, whether it's in the care enablement side of the equation or whether it's in the administrative service side of the equation. We see it as a meaningful value creator, and I appreciate you calling that out. Sure. And Michael, just transition from Brian's point, I'd point you to the fact that our SG&A ratio for 2021 was a very attractive number and our outlook for 2022 is a further improvement so back to embedded in our outlook as a further improvement to the SG&A ratio. Relative to the Medicare rate notice in the 2023 environment, we view it as just macro positive environment for us to lean into. I think to the core of your question, do we view it negatively or do we have regret relative to our growth posture for 2022 as we look to the rate notice for 2023? My answer to you is yes and no. Clearly, we would like more lives that are sustainable to be able to serve, but we believe being disciplined in this more fluid environment of '21 to '22, what was a better answer and better decision. And I would remind you, we're talking about numbers off of a book of business of about 550,000 lives. So within our portfolio, that's about 10% - 5% of the enterprise revenue, we're able to make those trade-off decisions. Looking to 2023, we see more opportunity, and when we see that opportunity off of our base, we see the opportunity off of our geographic expansion off the last two years, and we see that opportunity being further enabled by the rate environment for 2023; so we're excited by that. Kevin, appreciate your questions. Two very different markets in two very different market environments. Specifically to the individual exchange environment, our point of view is adding more lives at 0 or negative margin is not a shareholder prudent posture. Two, in a marketplace that is fluid year in, year out, we've been able to prove that as that marketplace is unrelated. Our discipline has played through safe for the special enrollment period that played through in 2021. Our discipline has played through in a net positive way, as we've been able to build more geographies, more focus in geographies and yield a sustainable proposition. But to be very clear, our conclusion is that adding additional lives in a marketplace that's fluid year in, year out, at 0 or negative margin in a capital-intensive subsegment of the marketplace is not prudent. Looking forward, that marketplace will shake itself out as it has in the past, and we see attractive growth off of our existing geographies and new geographies. Relative to Medicare Advantage, your challenge is fair. I don't resist your macro challenge. In fact, we see that as opportunity versus downside relative to us. We've broadened our reach over the last couple of years meaningfully in terms of new MSAs as well as new counties. Our Star performance is deep within the 80s on a sustained basis, and our Net Promoter Score is quite high. So the cornerstone of the value proposition you can play through remains very attractive in the marketplace. I'd remind you that we've only participated in the individual market. And we've recently only participated in the individual HMO and PPO market over the recent vintage. So we looked within and said our strike zone was small, less than 20% of the addressable market. We've expanded that to about 30% of the addressable market. Now we'll continue to grow that over time. So we look at this current environment for both of these businesses, we're in 2022, we're able to be disciplined for both of those businesses and not chase low or 0 margin business and yield attractive revenue and earnings growth for the franchise and put ourselves in a position for what should be a very attractive 2023 for both of those businesses with attractive meaningful, sustainable growth outcomes. So therefore, margins expanding in the book to your point, not quite at but approaching more reasonably what our target margins are for the book of business, but not quite at that for 2022. So Dave, again, let's start with big picture. Big picture, the performance of that book of business as we step into 2022 has a pretty reasonable retention level, retention point is a couple of points below where we would like it to be given the competitive environment, just less new business sales. So from a value proposition for those we are serving today largely off of an individual HMO chassis and increasing off of an individual PPO chassis, the value proposition resonates for those that are consuming our services. But the new business side of the equation a little bit more challenging given the dynamics in the marketplace. I think we always enhance the value proposition. So to the core of your point, I would point toward two areas. One, the ability to continue to accelerate and enhance the collaboration between the pharmacy, the specialty pharmacy and the behavioral subcomponent of the proposition. And two, the ability to further leverage some alternative side of care opportunities for the benefit, in this case, of the senior beneficiary to deliver both better overall affordability and convenience. So you can think about that as alternative side of care being digital, home care or extending the services that could be delivered in a coordinated value-based physician relationship from that standpoint. We see both of those as net additional added value opportunities for both affordability as well as personalization for the individuals we serve. And both of those are enabled through further expansion of Evernorth. Lance, it's David. You packed a lot into one question. Let us try to touch upon each. I'll take the Prime question. I'll take the upside on the Cigna book, and I'll ask Brian to take the specialty and specialty generic piece of the equation. First, specific to Prime, just at a more macro level, I'm not going to go through detailed renewal situation with the - on the line here. But if you take two steps back, Prime is a great reinforcement of our orientation around partnering. Our health plan business has continued to grow. I referenced previously, we've had net growth in our health plan portfolio of about 20 health plans over the last several years. Specific to Prime, we're proud to be able to serve our Prime both organization, health plans within it and the members. We've been able to expand the relationship and broaden the relationship over time. And importantly, Lance, we co-collaborate and co-innovate with the health plans within Prime to help to drive further growth for them. So we view it as a positive and it's a reinforcement of the meaningful and attractive sustained growth we've had in our health plan portfolio of businesses. As it relates to upside within the Cigna portfolio, we continue to drive leverage between the Cigna Healthcare portfolio and the Evernorth portfolio. For example, our growth recently with UPMC is an example of leverage between the two organizations, where we leverage some of our Cigna Healthcare capabilities within the Evernorth relationship for a strategic long-term partner when we were able to expand the relationship in that way. Specific to your - I think the traditional part of the way you're asking the question, I'll wrap up here, is on the PBM penetration within the Select segment always deemed that to be fully penetrated. Within the Middle Market segment, the level of penetration varies based on client relationship. We see some additional penetration as having been achieved. And then within National Accounts, it's an account by account relationship that is determined. So overall, we're pleased with our current state of penetration for PBM in Cigna Healthcare. It can move a little bit more, but I wouldn't have you look at it as a big barometer of movement rather the leverage of the relationships like a UPMC is a great example of, you're using the word penetration, we'll use the word cross-leverage and cross-value collaboration. Brian, I'd like you take the specialty in specialty generic piece. Yes. Efficient work, John, you grabbed another question there. I think your question points toward the criticality of sustained innovation. And if you - as I know you do, if you go back and look at the space over the last couple of decades, there continues to be periods of time where specialists will take a slice of the value proposition. And I don't say that as being an immaterial or on an important size of the value proposition, but we'll take a slice of the value proposition and try to drive super specialization within that. Typically, what that results in is either consolidation of those capabilities or accelerate innovation of those capabilities to be coordinated. So we don't think the picture you articulate is sustainable. We don't think your coworkers want to have multiple touch points coordinating them. We don't think medical professionals want multiple touch points coordinating them. But rather, the theme of a navigator is totally on strategy for us. We have generations of that within our portfolio, within different solutions that have been in the marketplace for quite some time. One guy capability and certain clinical team capabilities and certain service capabilities, and having a digital-first philosophy, which is what I discussed previously, would reinforce to you that we continue to not only expand programs but expand the capabilities on a digital-first standpoint that could be able to do the navigation for our customers in a much more coordinated way. So we view that as on strategy, we view that as part of our CapEx, we view it as part of our capabilities within our portfolio and we have multiple positive proof points of how we've been able to convert that today, but we do not view that as an opportunity for the marketplace to disintermediate over a long period of time because that fragmentation is not sustainable; so opportunity for us. I appreciate your effectiveness, John. You have a great day. See you. John reinforces that the operators suggestions are guidelines. But John, I do appreciate it very much. We want to thank everyone for your questions and importantly, your time this morning. And before I wrap up, I just have a couple of comments. First, I want to say how appreciative and proud I am of our more than 70,000 colleagues for continuing to serve our clients, our customers and patients in a very challenging environment. We've all gained an even greater appreciation of the importance of health and well-being during this prolonged pandemic. And in Cigna, we're committed to continuing to innovate to deliver more affordability, simplicity and predictability of solutions for our customers, our patients and our clients. Our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are well positioned for sustained growth, and we're confident that 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Thanks, and have a great day."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones.\nAlexis Jones: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Evanko, Cigna 's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna 's Third Quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021.  As noted in our earnings release when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US, otherwise known as GAAP.  A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders Net Income and total revenues respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release, and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $35 million or $0.10 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues on our discussion of financial results.  Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend s, and does not assume any impact from any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of Life, Accident, and Supplemental Benefits businesses outside of the U.S., which we expect to close in 2022. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Alexis. And thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. This morning I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions. Let's jump in. During the quarter we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion, and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders.  These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners, as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full-year 2001 guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs, as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SCP customers within our individual business.  As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR. And Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. Separately in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our Life, Accident and Supplemental Benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries from $5.7 billion -- $5.75 billion. We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals.  Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset, while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution and delivering attractive results, and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve. Now, I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. medical businesses.  A year-ago we launched Evernorth to tip the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations, and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups. Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us.  Wrapping around these two exceptionally strong platforms are additional suites of Innovative Health Services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions, and intelligent solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program, and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active-duty service members, retirees, and their families.  Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims, and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look to the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings. Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. commercial, our teams are leveraging in deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers.  For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth 's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral, and dermatology care. As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual-first health plan for employers.  Another great example of Evernorth in U.S. commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work, or travel outside their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions, and as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For the 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in 4-star or greater plans nationally.  This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the 5th year in a row we've improved our stars performance. And at our Individual and Family Plan business, we've driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. As I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical cost, amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual and family plan business by expanding our addressable markets again as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we're generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021.  We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022. Specifically, for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full-year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full-year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase.  Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business and additional contributions from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels. We're also expecting year-over-year headwind as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels.  And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Now to briefly summarize, as we've demonstrated through the quarter, and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.  We're also taking significant value enhancing actions, such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders, and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continued to deliver shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna 's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment. Driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations.  Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulted in Cigna 's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third-quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full-year 2021, which I will discuss shortly. Now, turning to Enterprise results, key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion, adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73.  Results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with contributions across all of our businesses, with overall performance above our expectations. I will now discuss our segment level results, and will then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 a adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. A adjusted pharmacy script volume increased 8% to 411 million scripts, and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020.  Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers, and patients. And deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021. Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. Medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19, and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business.  The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with the range of actions. Including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care.  Continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions, and we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients, and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and middle markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. In our international markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million.  These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses. Now, turning to our updated outlook for full-year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full-year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase, and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment.  This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined.  Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19. These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectation for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectation for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance. Turning to revenue, we now expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020, when adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability in Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018. I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients.  For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full-year 2021, adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook.  We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date as of November 3rd 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full-year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares.  This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22nd to shareholders of record as of December 7th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital.  So now to recap, results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients, and coworkers, and deliver on our financial commitments.  We now expect 2021 full-year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%, and we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS, at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance. With that, we'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Also, if you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the buttons. Finally, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question to allow sufficient time for questions from those remaining in the queue. And one moment please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hello, everybody. Just maybe to try to drill down a little bit on that expectation for at least 10% growth of the new updated numbers for this year. I know it sounds like you're getting away from talking about that $250 of net COVID impact you're absorbing this year and others various inputs there, but I was wondering, because their last quarter it sounded like you were carrying a lot of your expectation for COVID related costs broadly defined into next year. As you think about your updated thoughts about '22, can you comment on how much of ongoing COVID headwind are you expecting and is there any other big changes to the puts and takes you'd laid out last quarter as you think about '22?\nDavid Cordani: Hey A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022, now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it's testing, treatment, revenue, dislocation, etc.  Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and a broad funding mechanism continued to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really four big chunky items. One was up pulling the headwind category. The headwind created by the COVID cost and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement. And then, positives offsetting that somewhat which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items.  Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives, and our understanding of how this year is coming to close, broadly speaking, those puts and take in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. Our at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS, essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion.  And the residual at least 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. To recap, additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth -- mix of growth, rate execution affordability. And then secondly, the puts-and-takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they've largely offset one and other as we step into 2022, underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. David, I just wanted to better understand how you're thinking about the Ever-north business as we think about 2022? I know you've talked in the past about some of the business losses, but if you can give us an update as to how to think about Ever north going into 2022, and then as we think about the Ever-north business and think about the virtual primary care offerings that are out in the marketplace, what are you thinking with MDLIVE?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Lisa. So relative to Ever north, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Ever north. If you look at the inherent growth that ever north has delivered for the organization, and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that.  Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth because you'd invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Ever north and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Ever north portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth pharmacy, Evernorth care, Evernorth Benefits, and Evernorth intelligence. Our positioning growth at the serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies, and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace.  For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect to retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we'd identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we're quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace, so the business portfolio will grow yet again. Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio and that now resides within Evernorth care.  We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or Triage care. But two primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual-first offering. So, we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access, improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side of care capabilities. So, in a nutshell, we're pleased, we'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE.\nLisa Gill: Great, thanks for the comments.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask David about the international sale. First, in terms of multiple, it looks like you've got about 10 to 12 times kind of net income for that business. Is that correct? In the right ballpark? And then if so, just curious in terms of the strategic nature of the sale in terms of -- the multiple looks depressed relative to a business that's historically been looked at as a double-digit top-line grower. And then could you tell us how we should think about capital deployment once you get those funds? Is it going to be similar to what we saw with the Life and Disability, where there's a lot of share repo or should we think about something else? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Good morning, Justin. Let me start and have Brian shape a little further both how we feel about the value realization here in the capital deployment. First, stepping back, we're quite proud of what has been built in our international portfolio over a long period of time. This specific portion of our international portfolio, so direct to individual life, accident and supplemental businesses, we've successfully grown over a long period of time. But using our strategy as a guide, the important underscore here, our strategy guides us to further enhance and deepen our health and well-being solutions.  This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So, we use the strategy as a guide number 1. 2, we feel very good about the value realization, and the net value realization area is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset. And I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.  And then finally, that strategic action is done to allow us to even further intensify our focus in the sub segments of the business that are more health and well-being oriented, both in the U.S. as well as globally from that standpoint as we'll continue to grow. I'll ask Brian to speak a little bit more towards how we look at the valuation and our capital deployment philosophy going forward.\nBrian Evanko: Yeah, sure, David. And good morning, Justin. The math that you asked about in terms of the 10 times to 12 times multiple is in the right ballpark if you're looking at U.S. GAAP earnings contributions from the divested businesses, but very importantly, this is a case where economics and accounting don't necessarily square up. If you look at the discounted cash flows of the business here and the purchase price that we were able to get, it's quite an attractive deal economically that we're quite pleased with the financial terms for that reason, as you look at the timing of when dividends were available to be extracted, as an example.  In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the the broad template as, David made reference to of our group disability and life divestiture, is what we would expect to fall in this instance as well, with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the group disability and life transactions. So, we would expect the primary use to be for share repurchase. And when we indicated in the press release that this would be neutral to slightly diluted to our 2022 EPS outlook. That's under the assumption that the primary use is for share repurchase.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nMichael Hall: Hey guys, this is Michael Hall on for Ricky. Thanks for the question. So, as it relates to 2022 commercial growth, a number of your peers have already mentioned expecting strong growth. They diffuse concerns around member attrition, and the dynamic, and emphasize share gains, I think one of your peers even mentioned '22 shaping up to be one of the strongest national account selling seasons in history. So, with that said, it's been a bright area, but also hard to imagine that everyone is winning contracts and gaining share. So, with that context, what are you guys seeing with the competitive landscape? And are you able to grow next year when everyone else comes in taking share?\nDavid Cordani: Mike, good morning. It's David. Just a minute of backdrop relative to our performance in the commercial market and then I'll jump right into '22. We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace. As we seek the sub-segment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade - ish, we've generally grown low-single-digit medical membership. We couple that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services.  And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions and the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships, like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. Now, specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again, and specifically, within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts in large account business portfolio, and we'll have another year of growth within our select segment.  So, the net of all that, in a marketplace that is competitive, as we are oriented around solutions that have affordability and high engagement programs with the right funding mechanisms, we will again have another year of net growth in the U.S. commercial portfolio, and it's something we're quite proud of and positioned to continue on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. It sounds like in the quarter you mentioned, you've benefited from investment income and specialty outperformance. I guess, two things. So, do you believe that the specialty outperformance is something that is going to be sustainable? And then if you could just talk a little bit more about the competitive landscape for commercial pricing for next year, do you think that you're going to be within your target range? Or I guess maybe where your target range is expected to be in the commercial business for next year.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. I'll start on the first piece of your question. I think this was in the context of our U.S. Medical performance in terms of your question on specialty. So, as you reflect on our third quarter performance for that segment, again, the earnings in totality were above our expectations in the quarter. We had two areas of favorability, as you called out, investment income, and specialty contributions. And your specialty contributions includes pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain.  That was partly offset by the two sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period. MCR is now in elevated in the Individual exchange. Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter. The investment income is non-recurring, so you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or '22.  We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22. That was a smaller component of the 2 in terms of the favorable items in the third quarter, but that is something we would expect to continue to persist going forward. David maybe will comment on the pricing environment for commercial.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Good morning, Kevin. Relative to the pricing environment for commercial, and I'm going to maybe sneak in a little bit on the individual marketplace here as well. But specifically, that market has continued to be a competitive market, and it remains that meaning the commercial marketplace, more broadly, the employer commercial market. And with that as a backdrop into my prior answer, we will grow our commercial book of business and we will improve our MCR. Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business.  So, to do that, we will be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we're willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. An add-on specifically in the individual market -- our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such in the Individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio. And that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio, as well as earnings expansion.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back to the MCR comments and appreciate what you just said, David, but just wanted to think a little bit more about 2021 so far. So, as we kind of look at the potential impact of special enrollment period enrollees based on your typical attrition. It doesn't look like that's particularly material to the increase in MCR versus 2019 baseline, which is up about 400 basis points in the 3Q when you had a lot of COVID costs, but it was up almost 400 basis points in the 2Q when you didn't have a lot of COVID costs and you had more deferred care coming back.  So, I guess the question is, is there any other substantial moving parts to how you're running versus the 2019 baseline, and then just going forward, what are your -- what do you anticipate as COVID and the Delta variant comes down? Do you feel like commercial utilization is largely caught up or we're sort of still back in a cycle, like you were in the 2Q where you see some of the deferred care increasing?\nBrian Evanko: Morning, Gary. It's Brian. So, I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So, as you think about where we are running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full-year guide. I think that that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. the 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lives within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are, and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would've had an MCR performance for the full-year that was more like the higher end of our prior guidance range, so towards the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the Individual SCP customers from the full-year outlook.  So just to give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year, so there were not that many in the second quarter, there were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us, particularly, significantly in the third quarter and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. As David did reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrit into our choose new carriers.  As it relates to other parts of the portfolio. The commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID related costs, particularly in August and September, with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. Medical book of business.  Hopefully it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. In terms of your question, looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, etc. we have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic, and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnoses, etc. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022.\nGary Taylor: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Taylor. And next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. You may ask your question.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I want to go back -- you guys specifically called out the increased specialty contributions, and obviously that's always been part of the story. So hoping you can give more details there, what the specific drivers are there, and anything to call out. And then maybe within that, I was hoping you could talk about the stop loss product. I would have imagined that just given higher commercial trend that maybe more of that is being triggered and maybe some underperformance there. But we just like to get your commentary on how that's performed and how we should think about that for 2022 from a re-pricing perspective. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Morning, Ralph, it's David. Just a couple of minutes on the shaping and I'll hand it over to Brian. As you articulate the specialty components, so we look at that broadly back to our strategy. Our strategy has been and continues to be how do we wrap the right suite of solutions, employer by employer, to help to get the overall health and wellbeing offering aligned in the overall affordability line. And historically, one thinks about a specialty suite of a few products of behavioral pharmacy, Dental has expanded tremendously to 25, 30 different services when you take the subsegments of decision, support, chronic care management, specialty services, now virtual alternative services, etc.  My point of underscoring this has been as you articulated and continues to be a really important part of our strategy to try to get the right value to be realized for our for our clients, our customers, and our patients. And as I noted, our Evernorth service capabilities continue to grow, which add to the portfolio of services to be levered there. I will ask Brian to talk a little bit more in terms of the drivers.\nBrian Evanko: Sure, David. Good morning, Ralph. So in terms of the specialty contributions we called out they're the couple of areas I'd particularly point to as more material within our self-funded business, we had some strength in pharmacy in particular, and as I mentioned earlier, to a prior question, we would expect that to persist as we head into 2022. We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. So we saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter.  And again, those are two areas we would expect to persist as we head into the new year. Relative to stop loss, obviously you gotta pull this one apart further because you got Individual stop loss cover as well as aggregate stop loss cover, and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID related claimants didn't actually hit our Individual stop-loss thresholds. Yet we saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business.  That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we positioned there on a prospective basis. I'd also note we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw on the supplement there, we had 7% premium growth on our stop loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So, feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you guys taking the question. So the MLR, I know you guys, only disclose one sort of big MLR for the U.S. Medical segments. I was wondering if you could break out or give a little bit more color even if it just directional on the MLR 's for sort of commercial and then, government and maybe, even within government, how much was from the IFP versus Medicare Advantage? And then just a quick follow-up on stop-loss, what are the attachment points at the individual claim level typically? I know there's a range of those, but kind of maybe what's the most common thresholds than an individual has to hit?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Josh. So I'll try not to be too redundant with some of my prior comments, but just to kind of summarize a few important points here as you pull apart the MLR for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the Individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well.  So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have poor performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. Medicare Advantage as I made reference to actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. And then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the Delta variant in the months of August and September in particular.  So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you, do you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the client. So we tend to see particular popularity around the $15,000 to $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time.\nJosh Raskin: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question.\nJames Stewart: Hi, this is James Stewart on for Kevin. Just maybe with the sale of Chubb, you're signaling more of a focus to core healthcare business. Are there any other segments within the Company that you consider a non-core that you might be looking to dispose off in the future?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. As you noted, the action we took relative to that part of our portfolio and previously the action we took relative to our group insurance business, we deem to be a good fiduciary management of the portfolio and looking at the strategy as a guide to our actions, headline is I would not signal anything of materiality that sits on the horizon. I would reinforce, it's a dynamic process. Our responsibility is to dynamically manage that. But I would not signal anything on the horizon. I'm quite proud of the organization and pleased with the successful execution of both transactions: one completed, second under regulatory review right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Steve Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.\nSteve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just a question that maybe tie as a lot of the other discussion points together. For the preliminary view of '22, I know it's early, but just thinking about the framework of '22 relative to some of your long-term targets that you laid out the analyst meeting. I'm curious -- so for U.S. Medical, you just talked about growth next year, but the long-term guidance range is 8% to 11% earnings growth in that segment, 4% to 6% for Evernorth, and the rest from capital deployment.  But should we think about -- is that still the usable framework going into '22, or should we think about maybe less operational growth, and maybe more from capital deployment. Just any additional thoughts around those components might help knowing that its preliminary right now.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Good morning, it's David. Big picture as you look to 2022, brief reference to this previously, but our view of the earnings visibility and the growth visibility relative to 2022 essentially, if you take the -- at least 10%, we underscore that with capital contribution to our EPS growth in line with our strategic target, which is 4 to 5. Then if you back away from that, that leaves you 5 to 6 fundamental organic earnings growth contribution to get to the at least 10% number. And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluidity and dynamism of the marketplace.  Broadly speaking, both components are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and we have a track record including 2021, which is a disrupted year of delivering in line with that. Good fundamentals, a little more than 50% of it being organic, a little less than 50% of it being capital deployment, and very much in line with our long-term strategic targets.\nSteve Valiquette: Got it. Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to ask what you're seeing in terms of customer preferences and actions in the middle market, particular degree of interest in alternate ASO type funding for the products versus what you've seen over the last few years. And then maybe in the stop loss market associated with that. Am I correct that some of the other carriers may be correcting for what was perhaps overly aggressive pricing in earlier years, which is maybe giving you a little bit of a tailwind there on your own growth?\nDavid Cordani: Matthew, good morning, It's David. So you referenced middle market. I don't think there's a singular common definition middle markets, so let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance the purchase after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured, and the service models are configured to align as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer in the balance relative to them, so having that broad suite is really important.  If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 live clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed cost versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle-market, the further you walk up an average size, on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer. And in the in between range, some for shared returns of a fundamentals that exist.  So a little bit of linearity as you just go off in respect to size from that standpoint, but the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decisions. from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or reconfiguration effect that happened that we've benefited from a stop-loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop loss.  And I'm remind ed from prior conversations, we have a large book, we have a dedicated team that manages that book because it needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need, as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth in stop loss over the recent past.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nGeorge Hill: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. David and Brian, just a couple of being counting ones and a quick question. David, I just want to make sure that 2035 or whatever the number is post Q4 is the right jumping off point for the 10% or better growth in 2022, given it sounds like you're saying all the other pushes and pulls are on mute now, can you quantify PBM to commercial medical cross-sales this selling season? And I'll pause right there.\nDavid Cordani: So George Hill it's two questions I heard. Question 1, yes. The at least $20.35, which is our raised EPS is the appropriate jump off to attach the at least 10% growth. We're pleased to have that underlying strength in that clarity of message. The second question, I think you're asking relative to PBM, commercial cross-sell penetration, etc. In respective growth, I don't have an Individual number for you. We have not historically walk-through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business.  As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering, and as you move upmarket, it's more of a standalone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a standalone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called up my prepared remarks, there were 2 fundamental ways in which a client or customer establishes their primary health and wellbeing relationship.  Either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship. and we're positioned to lever both. So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength over pharmacy strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive. And we continue to see on traction both on standalone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. Just wanted to come back to the individual market commentary you made. Appreciate that you're pricing, I guess conservatively in a fairly competitive backdrop. How much of the way back towards your target margins do you think that's going to get you in 2022? And then how should we think about growth beyond 2022 as you previously have talked about, doubling this market through 2025? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Stephen. We were seeking to be quite clear in terms of -- there's argue -- indisputably, there's some pockets of intense competitive pricing in the IFP marketplace or the Individual exchange marketplace as it's probably articulated. Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our aggregate earnings objectives, while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be 1.  So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the Individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022, to a more attractive and more sustainable level and we'll maintain the discipline there.  As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've managed it and if we demonstrate it over time, if there were temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and will lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties, to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to.  And we've been in this marketplace since its inception in 2014. And we have a track record of sustained performance, albeit episodically needing to sharpen focus as we will in 2022, given the market conditions.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. David, I'm interested in your views, albeit early, on this Build Back Better bill that appears to be moving toward a vote, and maybe specifically, what you think the impact of government negotiation on a top 10 or 20 drugs beyond our exclusivity would have on your PBM business?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Dave. So clearly a lot of fluidity right now on the health and we've operated for a long period of time in an environment and we'll continue to that has an active both legislative and regulatory agenda. So we understand that fully. Big picture stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable, that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of.  Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on. We think the most meaningful way to test sustainable policies -- policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if a heart come back as an example to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. But as the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from, the overall affordability changed dramatically.  That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting in artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. Big picture, we will await specific details and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability, is to expand choice and expand competition.  That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, per prior conversation we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio pharmacy services and tools is well-positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident in the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here.\nDavid Windley: Great, thanks for your thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Windley. Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Could you just give a little more color on Evernorth pharmacy and what I was particularly interested in is, from a vaccine standpoint in the quarter, how much of that impact volumes and margin? And then are you seeing much impact to margin from specialty pharmacy going generic, whether that's the beginning or your outlook for that? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. So within the third quarter in Evernorth, we fulfilled about 4 million COVID vaccine prescriptions. So to put that into context, that's about 1% of our total script volume, and year-to-date, we're up to about 16 million across the three quarters here in 2021. So again, roughly about 1% of total script volumes for Evernorth, but not a material contribution from an income standpoint.  And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. More broadly on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics, and you can even broaden that to include biosimilars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. We think competition is a good thing and ultimately, Specialty Generics.  While the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns. Ultimately, we view that as a great thing for our clients, customers, and ultimately for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed. We're really excited about especially generics and biosimilars going forward.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Just to briefly wrap up our call. I do want to underscore how proud and appreciative I am of our more than 70,000 co-workers around the globe who continue to be dedicated to the many stakeholders we serve. Our team is working to support our patients, our clients, our customers, our partners, in this very fluid and ongoing challenging environment.  And the team is -- continue to step-up time and time again to make sure we're providing the level of support, again for our clients, our customers, our patients, as well as our communities. And through it all as an enterprise, we remain focused on executing our strategy guided by our framework of delivering value every day, partnering and innovating to expand, and then expanding our addressable markets to broaden our reach. We thank you for your engagement today. We look forward to providing future updates on our success going forward, and ask you to enjoy the rest of your day.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review key aspects of Cigna 's third quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I will discuss our updated outlook for the full year. During the quarter, total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our U.S. Medical segment. Driven largely by the impact of the Delta variant in our U.S. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our U.S. individual business. Importantly, I would remind you that approximately 80% of our revenues are from service-based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations.  Our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulted in Cigna 's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations. This strong third-quarter performance, coupled with capital deployment activities, led to an increased outlook for full-year 2021, which I will discuss shortly. Now, turning to Enterprise results, key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9% to $44.3 billion, adjusted earnings growth of 20% to $1.9 billion after tax, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 30% to $5.73.  Results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with contributions across all of our businesses, with overall performance above our expectations. I will now discuss our segment level results, and will then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Third quarter 2021 a adjusted revenues grew 13% to $33.6 billion. A adjusted pharmacy script volume increased 8% to 411 million scripts, and adjusted pretax earnings grew 7% to $1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020.  Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth, including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy, along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients, customers, and patients. And deepening of existing relationships, partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities.  Overall, Evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first 3 quarters of 2021. Turning to U.S. Medical. Third quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were approximately $1 billion. Overall, our U.S. Medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter, reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions, partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of COVID-19, and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business.  The net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4% in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we are actively managing overall medical costs and our MCR with the range of actions. Including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care.  Continued discipline in our pricing and rate actions, and we're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients, and moderate overall medical costs over the longer term. Turning to membership, we ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year-to-date. In U.S. Medical, the year-to-date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and middle markets within U.S. commercial and continued organic growth in Medicare Advantage and individual within U.S. government. In our international markets business, third quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $250 million.  These results were in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $275 million. Overall, Cigna's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients. Cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders, leveraging our well-positioned businesses. Now, turning to our updated outlook for full-year 2021. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full-year 2021 to at least $20.35 per share, reflecting the strength of the quarter, the favorable impact of our year-to-date share repurchase, and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment.  This represents EPS growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth range of 10% to 13%, even with the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021. As we look forward, it is clear that COVID-19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022. And as time progresses, COVID related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined.  Therefore, we no longer believe it's instructive to continue to quantify the impact of COVID-19. These dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectation for adjusted EPS of at least $20.35 and our 2022 expectation for EPS growth of at least 10% off this 2021 guidance. Turning to revenue, we now expect full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $172 billion, representing growth of at least 11% from 2020, when adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability in Life business. I would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long-term average annual growth goal of 6% to 8% and represents the third consecutive year of significant revenue outperformance since our combination with Express Scripts in late 2018. I will now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we continue to expect full-year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients.  For U.S. Medical, we continue to expect full-year 2021, adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 84% to 84.5%, which includes our expectations for elevated medical costs for individual special enrollment period customers. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook.  We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. For full-year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date as of November 3rd 2021, we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $6.3 billion. And we now expect full-year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares.  This includes the impact of the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter. On October 27th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on December 22nd to shareholders of record as of December 7th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient, service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital.  So now to recap, results in the third quarter reflects strong top and bottom-line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Cigna has shown the ability to deliver value through dynamic environments with our breadth of businesses and multiple earnings levers. We continue to support our customers, clients, and coworkers, and deliver on our financial commitments.  We now expect 2021 full-year adjusted earnings of at least $20.35 per share, representing growth of at least 10% from 2020, consistent with our long-term EPS growth rate range of 10% to 13%, and we expect to grow 2022 adjusted EPS, at least 10% off our raised 2021 guidance. With that, we'll turn it over to the Operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Yeah, sure, David. And good morning, Justin. The math that you asked about in terms of the 10 times to 12 times multiple is in the right ballpark if you're looking at U.S. GAAP earnings contributions from the divested businesses, but very importantly, this is a case where economics and accounting don't necessarily square up. If you look at the discounted cash flows of the business here and the purchase price that we were able to get, it's quite an attractive deal economically that we're quite pleased with the financial terms for that reason, as you look at the timing of when dividends were available to be extracted, as an example.  In terms of deployment with the proceeds, the the broad template as, David made reference to of our group disability and life divestiture, is what we would expect to fall in this instance as well, with the exception of we don't have the same need for long-term debt repayment as we did with the group disability and life transactions. So, we would expect the primary use to be for share repurchase. And when we indicated in the press release that this would be neutral to slightly diluted to our 2022 EPS outlook. That's under the assumption that the primary use is for share repurchase. Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. I'll start on the first piece of your question. I think this was in the context of our U.S. Medical performance in terms of your question on specialty. So, as you reflect on our third quarter performance for that segment, again, the earnings in totality were above our expectations in the quarter. We had two areas of favorability, as you called out, investment income, and specialty contributions. And your specialty contributions includes pharmacy, behavioral, dental, the full suite of portfolio capabilities we have in the specialty domain.  That was partly offset by the two sources of claims pressure that I articulated in the COVID related pressure in commercial as well as the special enrollment period. MCR is now in elevated in the Individual exchange. Specifically on the favorability that we recorded in the third quarter. The investment income is non-recurring, so you should not consider that to be something that would occur again in the fourth quarter or '22.  We would expect the specialty contributions to persist as favorability as we head into fourth quarter and into '22. That was a smaller component of the 2 in terms of the favorable items in the third quarter, but that is something we would expect to continue to persist going forward. David maybe will comment on the pricing environment for commercial. Morning, Gary. It's Brian. So, I'll try to take the various components of that question here. So, as you think about where we are running in 2021 on the MCR, maybe I'll talk in terms of the full-year guide. I think that that's probably the most constructive way to pull it apart. the 84% to 84.5% refresh guidance that we issued. If the special enrollment period lives within the individual exchange portfolio had not grown to the level that they are, and had not had the elevated MCR that they did in the quarter, we would've had an MCR performance for the full-year that was more like the higher end of our prior guidance range, so towards the higher end of the 83% to 84% range, if you exclude the impact of the Individual SCP customers from the full-year outlook.  So just to give you a little bit of dimensioning as to the materiality there. Those customer lives have built up over the course of the year, so there were not that many in the second quarter, there were many more in the third quarter. And the elevated MCR hit us, particularly, significantly in the third quarter and we expect that pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. As David did reference to in a prior question, we would expect that to dissipate into 2022 as many of those lives attrit into our choose new carriers.  As it relates to other parts of the portfolio. The commercial business in the third quarter, we had some elevated COVID related costs, particularly in August and September, with the Delta variant hitting younger ages more significantly than earlier in the pandemic. So that created some elevated commercial claim cost pressure in the third quarter. I would note in our Medicare Advantage book, the MCR in the quarter was a little bit favorable to our expectations, which gives us greater confidence here as we head into 2022 on that subset of the overall U.S. Medical book of business.  Hopefully it gives you a little bit of a picture for how 2021 is shaping up. In terms of your question, looking forward on commercial utilization, are we caught up, etc. we have seen much less deferred care in the commercial line of business throughout the pandemic, and all the indicators that we track, whether that be preventive care utilization or whether that be rates of new cancer diagnoses, etc. I would tell you that there's not a significant amount of future pent-up demand or catch-up care to come. With that said, our pricing posture, as David mentioned earlier continues to be a prioritization of margin expansion as we head into 2022. Sure, David. Good morning, Ralph. So in terms of the specialty contributions we called out they're the couple of areas I'd particularly point to as more material within our self-funded business, we had some strength in pharmacy in particular, and as I mentioned earlier, to a prior question, we would expect that to persist as we head into 2022. We also saw some upside within our behavioral health offerings as demand for that has continued to grow throughout the pandemic. So we saw some increased uptake there, which drove some additional margin for us within the quarter.  And again, those are two areas we would expect to persist as we head into the new year. Relative to stop loss, obviously you gotta pull this one apart further because you got Individual stop loss cover as well as aggregate stop loss cover, and the dynamics there behaved a little bit differently throughout the pandemic, meaning most COVID related claimants didn't actually hit our Individual stop-loss thresholds. Yet we saw a little bit of pressure earlier in the pandemic on our aggregate stop loss business.  That business gets repriced along with our typical 12-month contract cycles for all the clients that we have. So we feel good about how we positioned there on a prospective basis. I'd also note we're seeing good demand for that product. You probably saw on the supplement there, we had 7% premium growth on our stop loss line in the quarter-over-quarter. So, feeling good about all the specialty solutions when you look at the total portfolio. Good morning, Josh. So I'll try not to be too redundant with some of my prior comments, but just to kind of summarize a few important points here as you pull apart the MLR for the full year, as I mentioned earlier, the refresh 84% to 84.5% outlook reflects particular pressure from the Individual exchange lives and specifically the special enrollment period enrollees. So removing that, we would have been toward the higher end of our prior guide of 83% to 84%, but a sub bullet there is the individual open enrollment lives are actually performing pretty well.  So when we look at the profitability of the overall individual portfolio, we have good performance on the standard open enrollment lives. We have poor performance on the special enrollment period lives and the total picture there is therefore a bit elevated. Medicare Advantage as I made reference to actually ran a little bit favorable to our expectations in the third quarter. And then commercial was a touch higher than our projections due to the effect of the Delta variant in the months of August and September in particular.  So those are the broad buckets that I paint for you, do you think about what's inside the medical care ratio. Relative to stop loss, we do have a range of attachment points depending on the client. So we tend to see particular popularity around the $15,000 to $75,000 level, but it really depends on the risk appetite for a given client. So it's hard to say that there's one that's always the preferred choice. We have a distribution and the distribution evolves depending on the appetite for clients at any given point in time. Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. So within the third quarter in Evernorth, we fulfilled about 4 million COVID vaccine prescriptions. So to put that into context, that's about 1% of our total script volume, and year-to-date, we're up to about 16 million across the three quarters here in 2021. So again, roughly about 1% of total script volumes for Evernorth, but not a material contribution from an income standpoint.  And if that number goes up or down next year, it won't materially move the needle for the Evernorth segment. More broadly on the second part of your question, as we think about specialty generics, and you can even broaden that to include biosimilars. We're really excited about those for the future from the standpoint of driving affordability on behalf of our clients and customers. We think competition is a good thing and ultimately, Specialty Generics.  While the timing with which they're introduced is hard to predict and does create some variability in our quarterly income patterns. Ultimately, we view that as a great thing for our clients, customers, and ultimately for our business. And fortunately, we have a wide range of earnings levers that allow us to capture value in a variety of ways depending on how different client contracts are constructed. We're really excited about especially generics and biosimilars going forward."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexis. And thank you to everyone for joining us on our call today. This morning I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our strong results for the quarter, how we are advancing our growth strategy, and I'll provide some additional perspective on our 2022 outlook, and then Brian will share some more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, and then we'll take your questions. Let's jump in. During the quarter we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion, and adjusted EPS of $5.73 per share, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion, and ongoing innovation, and we continue to return significant value to our shareholders.  These results reinforce we are delivering for our customers, our patients, clients, provider partners, as well as for you, our shareholders. With our high performing health service portfolio and sharp focus on executing our strategy, we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth and are again raising our full-year 2001 guidance for adjusted EPS and revenue. Our performance is strong, considering the ongoing impact of the pandemic on medical costs, as well as the higher claims we've experienced amongst the special enrollment period or SCP customers within our individual business.  As it relates to our MCR in the quarter, our commercial business did improve from the second quarter to the third quarter, and our Medicare Advantage business also improved sequentially. We continue to execute a series of actions in 2021 and 2022 to further improve our MCR. And Brian will walk through this in more detail in a few moments. Separately in early October, we also announced an agreement with Chubb to sell our Life, Accident and Supplemental Benefits business in our international markets platform in 7 countries from $5.7 billion -- $5.75 billion. We expect to realize about $5.4 billion in net after-tax proceeds and to complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals.  Guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business, this transaction unlocks the value of the best-in-class leading asset, while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well-being services. So overall, our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution and delivering attractive results, and importantly, our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well-being needs of those we serve. Now, I'll walk through some additional detail for our Evernorth and U.S. medical businesses.  A year-ago we launched Evernorth to tip the marketplace as our health service platform, focused on servicing health plans, employers, government organizations, and healthcare providers. Since that time, Evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups. Our Evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our U.S. medical platform are the 2 primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us.  Wrapping around these two exceptionally strong platforms are additional suites of Innovative Health Services through Evernorth, including benefits management, care solutions, and intelligent solutions. These help us to expand and deepen existing relationships. In the third quarter, Evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the Department of Defense TRICARE pharmacy program, and renewed a 7-year contract. It's our privilege to serve almost 10 million active-duty service members, retirees, and their families.  Evernorth will continue supporting TRICARE pharmacy operations, including specialty pharmacy services, military pharmacy claims, and retail network pharmacies. The new contract also allows for expansion of specialty and care coordination services through 2029. As we look to the balance of the year and into 2022, Evernorth will continue to grow revenue and earnings. Turning to our U.S. Medical platform. In U.S. commercial, our teams are leveraging in deploying the innovative solutions from Evernorth to expand our service offerings and address the evolving needs of our clients and customers.  For example, in our U.S. commercial platform, we are leveraging Evernorth 's MDLIVE capabilities to expand virtual care options for our customers through their employers with primary, urgent, behavioral, and dermatology care. As part of these value-based arrangements during virtual visits, MDLIVE physicians are leveraging our Evernorth intelligence capabilities, enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience. And we continue to expand our capabilities with MDLIVE as we recently launched a virtual-first health plan for employers.  Another great example of Evernorth in U.S. commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health Plan. We will make in-network care available to UPMC customers who live, work, or travel outside their network service area. UPMC has been an Evernorth pharmacy client for 16 years, and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients.  We are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through our broad suite of solutions, and as such, we continue to grow through both our U.S. commercial and Evernorth platforms. Within Medicare Advantage, consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies. Our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings. For the 2022 calendar year, 89% of our Medicare Advantage customers will be in 4-star or greater plans nationally.  This is the highest level we've ever achieved, and it marks the 5th year in a row we've improved our stars performance. And at our Individual and Family Plan business, we've driven strong growth in this year, increasing customers by 47% through the third quarter. A substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period. As I previously noted, some of the MCR impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical cost, amongst those we added during the outpaced SEP growth.  We do expect this will moderate in 2022. We are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual and family plan business by expanding our addressable markets again as we enter in 3 new states and 93 new counties in 2022. These new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers. The continued strength of our results and the growth we're generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021.  We will deliver EPS in line with our long-term targets and revenue growth well above our long-term targets for yet another year. We will also deliver EPS within our long-term target range in 2022. Specifically, for 2021, we are committed to delivering our increased guidance for full-year adjusted EPS of at least $20.35. For full-year 2021, we remain on track for generating at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations and we expect to return more than $7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase.  Looking to 2022, we expect to grow EPS by at least 10% off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $20.35 per share. We anticipate a number of tailwinds, including core growth in our business and additional contributions from margin expansion in our U.S. Medical business as we drive pricing actions, execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of Medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels. We're also expecting year-over-year headwind as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels.  And of course, the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year-to-year. In short, 2022 will be another strong year for Cigna. Now to briefly summarize, as we've demonstrated through the quarter, and throughout 2021, we are delivering for our customers, patients, clients, and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.  We're also taking significant value enhancing actions, such as divesting a portion of our international business, returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders, and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and strategic partnerships. All of which position us to continue to advance our long-term growth agenda and continued to deliver shareholder value. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Hey A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me try to shape our insights relative to 2022, now that we're much deeper into 2021. First, you're right earlier this year, we've tried to frame the magnitude of the headwind and indisputably COVID had many disruptions to the marketplace, whether it's testing, treatment, revenue, dislocation, etc.  Against that backdrop, as you know, our broad service portfolio and a broad funding mechanism continued to perform quite well, and we're able to deliver from a marketplace standpoint. If you think about 2021, there's really four big chunky items. One was up pulling the headwind category. The headwind created by the COVID cost and the headwind created by MRA revenue decrement. And then, positives offsetting that somewhat which were favorable net investment income and some operating expense items.  Now as we think about and look at the 2022 environment, our visibility in terms of our growth outlook, our rate execution, our affordability initiatives, our efficiency initiatives, and our understanding of how this year is coming to close, broadly speaking, those puts and take in 2021 largely offset one another as we step into 2022, the headwinds and tailwinds. Our at least 10% growth in 2022 off of our elevated 2021 EPS, essentially represents capital deployment in line with our strategic target of 4% to 5% of accretion.  And the residual at least 5% to 6% from fundamental operating growth to get us to that at least 10%. To recap, additional visibility in terms of the drivers for 2022 growth -- mix of growth, rate execution affordability. And then secondly, the puts-and-takes in 2021 are configuring in a way that they've largely offset one and other as we step into 2022, underscoring that at least 10% is largely fundamental for our business portfolio. Good morning, Lisa. So relative to Ever north, first as we step into 2022, as Brian and I both noted, we're quite pleased with the underlying performance of Ever north. If you look at the inherent growth that ever north has delivered for the organization, and the diversity of the growth, we're quite pleased with that.  Secondly, our ability to both drive fundamental growth because you'd invest in innovation and extend our partnerships, we feel quite good. So just framing Ever north and then coming to the MDLIVE question, our Ever north portfolio has 4 specific portfolios of services that are positioned well: Evernorth pharmacy, Evernorth care, Evernorth Benefits, and Evernorth intelligence. Our positioning growth at the serving health plans, large employers, expanding with governmental agencies, and increasingly with healthcare providers continues to resonate well in the marketplace.  For 2022, to your comment relative to some losses, we expect to retention rate in the Evernorth pharmacy business in the mid-90s, which is still a strong result even with the known losses we'd identified. And given the strength we've had of growth over the last several years, we're quite committed to maintaining price discipline in the marketplace, so the business portfolio will grow yet again. Specific to MDLIVE, we're delighted to have the MDLIVE capabilities in our portfolio and that now resides within Evernorth care.  We see the utilization of those services continue to grow. As I noted, beyond important, urgent or Triage care. But two primary behavioral dermatology. And then we've recently expanded our virtual-first offering. So, we see it as a great opportunity to both expand access, improve affordability. But finally, it presents a platform to broaden some access to care in terms of alternative side of care capabilities. So, in a nutshell, we're pleased, we'll grow again and we're investing in further growth, including within the virtual capabilities of MDLIVE. Sure. Good morning, Justin. Let me start and have Brian shape a little further both how we feel about the value realization here in the capital deployment. First, stepping back, we're quite proud of what has been built in our international portfolio over a long period of time. This specific portion of our international portfolio, so direct to individual life, accident and supplemental businesses, we've successfully grown over a long period of time. But using our strategy as a guide, the important underscore here, our strategy guides us to further enhance and deepen our health and well-being solutions.  This portion of our portfolio was less directly aligned over time to that. So, we use the strategy as a guide number 1. 2, we feel very good about the value realization, and the net value realization area is quite important in terms of a high-performing asset. And I appreciate your correlation to the group transaction, another high-performing asset where we felt quite good about using our strategy as a guide and capitalizing on a very attractive valuation.  And then finally, that strategic action is done to allow us to even further intensify our focus in the sub segments of the business that are more health and well-being oriented, both in the U.S. as well as globally from that standpoint as we'll continue to grow. I'll ask Brian to speak a little bit more towards how we look at the valuation and our capital deployment philosophy going forward. Mike, good morning. It's David. Just a minute of backdrop relative to our performance in the commercial market and then I'll jump right into '22. We have a very focused strategy and a long track record over the last decade of successfully growing in the commercial marketplace. As we seek the sub-segment and deliver the right solutions for our respective clients in that marketplace. And if you think about it over the last decade - ish, we've generally grown low-single-digit medical membership. We couple that with significant and targeted cross-selling of our new and innovative services.  And then we complement that with appropriate pricing actions and the net of that yields higher single-digit revenue growth. So that's the big picture of our strategic approach. I'd also highlight with Evernorth, we are further expanding the services that we're able to bring through to deepen relationships, like our prior conversation relative to virtual care as an example. Now, specific to 2022, to be clear, we'll grow again. We will clearly grow our medical customer base again, and specifically, within the commercial market, we have good visibility in terms of having net growth in our national accounts in large account business portfolio, and we'll have another year of growth within our select segment.  So, the net of all that, in a marketplace that is competitive, as we are oriented around solutions that have affordability and high engagement programs with the right funding mechanisms, we will again have another year of net growth in the U.S. commercial portfolio, and it's something we're quite proud of and positioned to continue on. Sure. Good morning, Kevin. Relative to the pricing environment for commercial, and I'm going to maybe sneak in a little bit on the individual marketplace here as well. But specifically, that market has continued to be a competitive market, and it remains that meaning the commercial marketplace, more broadly, the employer commercial market. And with that as a backdrop into my prior answer, we will grow our commercial book of business and we will improve our MCR. Our visibility has us both growing and improving our MCR within the commercial book of business.  So, to do that, we will be quite disciplined, Kevin, to be clear, and we're willing to make targeted trade-offs for MCR or margin versus volume. And the net of that will yield net customer growth and net margin improvement as we step into 2022. An add-on specifically in the individual market -- our visibility in the individual market is that there are significant pockets of competitiveness in certain markets. And as such in the Individual marketplace, we would expect for 2022 to see no growth or more likely negative growth, some shrinkage in our book of business, but improvement in the MCR within that portfolio. And that's fully contemplated in our 2022 outlook of net growth for the portfolio, as well as earnings expansion. Morning, Ralph, it's David. Just a couple of minutes on the shaping and I'll hand it over to Brian. As you articulate the specialty components, so we look at that broadly back to our strategy. Our strategy has been and continues to be how do we wrap the right suite of solutions, employer by employer, to help to get the overall health and wellbeing offering aligned in the overall affordability line. And historically, one thinks about a specialty suite of a few products of behavioral pharmacy, Dental has expanded tremendously to 25, 30 different services when you take the subsegments of decision, support, chronic care management, specialty services, now virtual alternative services, etc.  My point of underscoring this has been as you articulated and continues to be a really important part of our strategy to try to get the right value to be realized for our for our clients, our customers, and our patients. And as I noted, our Evernorth service capabilities continue to grow, which add to the portfolio of services to be levered there. I will ask Brian to talk a little bit more in terms of the drivers. Good morning. It's David. As you noted, the action we took relative to that part of our portfolio and previously the action we took relative to our group insurance business, we deem to be a good fiduciary management of the portfolio and looking at the strategy as a guide to our actions, headline is I would not signal anything of materiality that sits on the horizon. I would reinforce, it's a dynamic process. Our responsibility is to dynamically manage that. But I would not signal anything on the horizon. I'm quite proud of the organization and pleased with the successful execution of both transactions: one completed, second under regulatory review right now. Sure. Good morning, it's David. Big picture as you look to 2022, brief reference to this previously, but our view of the earnings visibility and the growth visibility relative to 2022 essentially, if you take the -- at least 10%, we underscore that with capital contribution to our EPS growth in line with our strategic target, which is 4 to 5. Then if you back away from that, that leaves you 5 to 6 fundamental organic earnings growth contribution to get to the at least 10% number. And we think that's an appropriate and prudent and attractive outlook given the fluidity and dynamism of the marketplace.  Broadly speaking, both components are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and we have a track record including 2021, which is a disrupted year of delivering in line with that. Good fundamentals, a little more than 50% of it being organic, a little less than 50% of it being capital deployment, and very much in line with our long-term strategic targets. Matthew, good morning, It's David. So you referenced middle market. I don't think there's a singular common definition middle markets, so let me try to frame your important comment. First, as you look at our go-to market offerings, we have a broad suite of funding alternatives and we seek to offer to our clients their respective decision of how they want to finance the purchase after the benefits are configured, after the access profile is configured, after the clinical programs are configured, and the service models are configured to align as Brian referenced before, the risk transfer in the balance relative to them, so having that broad suite is really important.  If we look at the select segment, 100 to 500 live clients, it varies from year-to-year in terms of how much of the client demand is guaranteed cost versus self-funded with stop-loss, but self-funded with stop-loss has been a meaningful portion. And as you walk from that into the heart of what I might consider middle-market, the further you walk up an average size, on average, more demand for self-funded, less demand for risk transfer. And in the in between range, some for shared returns of a fundamentals that exist.  So a little bit of linearity as you just go off in respect to size from that standpoint, but the important part is choice that we offer in the marketplace and try to separate the financing decisions. from the design features from the program. I would say to the last part of your question, I do not believe that there's a boomerang or reconfiguration effect that happened that we've benefited from a stop-loss standpoint. We've seen just consistency in how we use stop loss.  And I'm remind ed from prior conversations, we have a large book, we have a dedicated team that manages that book because it needs to be specialization in that like many other aspects of our business. And it's both performed for clients, importantly, giving them the peace of mind and revenue predictability and expense predictability they need, as well as for us over a long period of time. But I would not call out anything unique in terms of ebbing and flowing that's changed our rate of growth in stop loss over the recent past. So George Hill it's two questions I heard. Question 1, yes. The at least $20.35, which is our raised EPS is the appropriate jump off to attach the at least 10% growth. We're pleased to have that underlying strength in that clarity of message. The second question, I think you're asking relative to PBM, commercial cross-sell penetration, etc. In respective growth, I don't have an Individual number for you. We have not historically walk-through individual numbers there. I'd ask you to step back and remember our strategy here. We have a high cross-sell and high integrated offering within our medical business.  As you think within the prior question that Matthew asked, as you go to our select segment, think about that as 100% integrated. It is so integral to our offering, and as you move upmarket, it's more of a standalone sale that needs to be made. We see continued progress there, and we're pleased to either have it as an integrated part of our medical offering or a standalone PBM offering that we could harness and sell additional services because at the end of the day, as I called up my prepared remarks, there were 2 fundamental ways in which a client or customer establishes their primary health and wellbeing relationship.  Either a pharmacy relationship or largely off of a medical relationship. and we're positioned to lever both. So I would leave you with a directional answer on the PBM commercial. Brian referenced PBM strength over pharmacy strength in our commercial portfolio. That's a net positive. And we continue to see on traction both on standalone pharmacy as well as integrated pharmacy within our business. Good morning, Stephen. We were seeking to be quite clear in terms of -- there's argue -- indisputably, there's some pockets of intense competitive pricing in the IFP marketplace or the Individual exchange marketplace as it's probably articulated. Given the breadth of our portfolio, we're going to be able to achieve both our aggregate growth as well as our aggregate earnings objectives, while maintaining price discipline in temporarily dislocated markets, and we deem that to be 1.  So we expect to see a net flat or decrement in our volumes in the Individual exchange business and a margin improvement. I'm not going to give you a margin number. We're not guiding in detail for 2022 yet and we typically don't guide relative to individual margins. Having said that, we expect to improve that margin from 2021 to 2022, to a more attractive and more sustainable level and we'll maintain the discipline there.  As it relates to intermediate to long term, we continue to see this as a growth market. But as we've managed it and if we demonstrate it over time, if there were temporary dislocations, we'll maintain discipline, and will lever other parts of the business to ensure the portfolio delivers. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've entered 3 more states and almost 100 additional counties, to give us access to an addressable market of approximately 1.5 million additional customers to sell to.  And we've been in this marketplace since its inception in 2014. And we have a track record of sustained performance, albeit episodically needing to sharpen focus as we will in 2022, given the market conditions. Good morning, Dave. So clearly a lot of fluidity right now on the health and we've operated for a long period of time in an environment and we'll continue to that has an active both legislative and regulatory agenda. So we understand that fully. Big picture stepping back, any initiatives that are constructive and sustainable, that improve affordability and value for individuals, we're actively open to engaged in and generally supportive of.  Specifically in the pharmacy space where you double-click down on. We think the most meaningful way to test sustainable policies -- policy change that could further affordability is to stimulate and further accelerate more competition. And if a heart come back as an example to make it tangible, hepatitis C was, I think, a very positive example that reinforces that. But as the marketplace rapidly move from 1 to 2 suppliers for hepatitis C services, which was a breakthrough drug that society benefits from, the overall affordability changed dramatically.  That's an action that is different than who's negotiating or it's very different than putting in artificial cap on a rate of growth from that standpoint. Big picture, we will await specific details and we will remain actively engaged, no doubt. We believe the most sustainable way to further improve affordability, is to expand choice and expand competition.  That's what's worked in the marketplace in the model. And lastly, per prior conversation we've had our well-performing and broad portfolio pharmacy services and tools is well-positioned to be able to deliver value in a changing environment, and we're confident in the capabilities we have over the strategic horizon here. Just to briefly wrap up our call. I do want to underscore how proud and appreciative I am of our more than 70,000 co-workers around the globe who continue to be dedicated to the many stakeholders we serve. Our team is working to support our patients, our clients, our customers, our partners, in this very fluid and ongoing challenging environment.  And the team is -- continue to step-up time and time again to make sure we're providing the level of support, again for our clients, our customers, our patients, as well as our communities. And through it all as an enterprise, we remain focused on executing our strategy guided by our framework of delivering value every day, partnering and innovating to expand, and then expanding our addressable markets to broaden our reach. We thank you for your engagement today. We look forward to providing future updates on our success going forward, and ask you to enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones.\nAlexis Jones: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded an after tax special item benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period. We also recorded an after tax special item charge of $14 million or $0.04 per share for integration and transaction related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues and our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend, and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Alexis and thank you for everyone for joining us on today's call. So I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the current environment and the forces that are shaping it, the strength in durable nature of our model that enables us to capitalize on opportunities and continue to grow even in the most disruptive conditions and how the strength and durability is fueling our short and long-term success. Then Brian will share more details about our second quarter results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll take your questions. So, let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $43 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.24 per share, all what we could do to drive balanced capital deployment as we execute on M&A, share repurchase and our quarterly dividend plan. We achieved these results in a fluid and challenging environment. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are confident in our ability to navigate these dynamic conditions. Our portfolio with three growth platforms enables us to create value for our clients and customers and drive sustained business growth. During the quarter, the strength of our Evernorth business was clearly a standout. We are seeing high demand for health services programs, and we continue to invest in broadening our service offerings, as well as our reach. Our sustained success validates our ability to be a trusted partner of choice for customers and clients, as they manage many of the most challenging aspects of healthcare today. We do this by leveraging our portfolio. That includes pharmacy solutions, benefit management solutions, care solutions, and intelligence solutions. Evernorth is helping to improve access to care, keep costs down and deliver better outcomes, as we serve our clients, patients, and customers. And another quarter of Evernorth strong revenue and earnings growth reinforces that our customers and clients value these capabilities. In Cigna Medical, we did see elevated medical cost pressure in the quarter, as costs associated with direct COVID-19 care and the broader ramp-up of utilization levels exceeded our projections. Within this challenging environment, we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our customers have access to the care they need. This includes the elevated mental health services needed during these unprecedented times, as well as continued to work with our customers and patients to help navigate them to optimal sites of care. During the quarter, we achieved customer growth in Cigna Medical, in both our U.S. Commercial and Government business. And we continue to be on track for medical customer growth of at least 350,000 customers in 2021. Brian will share additional perspective on our results and outlook and his comments. Overall, our performance, which is strong through the first half of the year, reflects the resiliency of our business and the balanced profile within our organization. With our focus on driving performance during the remainder of the year, it's imperative that we understand and account for the challenges our customers and clients will face, as well as the continued evolution of the healthcare landscape. At a macro level, the environment is marked by ongoing uncertainty for business, governments, communities around the world. For example, COVID vaccination levels have brought welcome relief to millions, given only about half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, and that percentage is much lower for the world's population. With the spread of the more contagious Delta variant, COVID infections and hospitalizations are on the rise in some regions, bringing renewed attention to travel restrictions and mask mandates. We see the economic recovery, while positive, has let uneven and varied amongst industries, as companies continue to cope with supply chain disruption, emerging inflationary pressure and various issues impacting the workforce. More broadly from a health perspective, federal and state policy makers continue to be actively engaged. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to see three primary forces of change shaping the healthcare landscape today and into the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovation, including specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, evolved oncology medications, vaccines and acceleration in biosimilars. Second, the recognition of the link between mental health and physical health continues to grow, especially accelerated in this COVID environment. And third, the rise of virtual care and other alternative access to care models are rapidly changing. Together, these macro dynamics are profoundly influencing buying behaviors and service innovation in healthcare. Now, with respect to clients, we are seeing a renewed commitment of employer clients to providing healthcare benefits vital to helping them to both attract and retain talent, as well as increased productivity by maintaining a healthy workforce. This includes, for example, adopting alternative side of care programs and access programs. We see an intensified need for affordability across all of our clients, including pharmacy services, as demand surges for high price, breakthrough drug therapies. We see a desire for more concentrated solution based services, as many clients are confronting the convergence of social, physical, and mental health issues in ways they have not experienced before. With respect to the individual customers and patients utilizing our service, we see that they're increasingly valuing their employee-based service models. They're benefiting from support services that help them tend to their emotional wellbeing. And they have growing demand for coordination of care, both in COVID and non-COVID events. Against this backdrop, we are delivering differentiated value for the benefit of our customers and clients with our capabilities that address their emerging and evolving needs. For example, we have had a strong focus on providing virtual services, broadening networks, as well as coordinated clinical programs. In our pharmacy solutions, we've been answering the call for greater affordability, as we continue to see the emergence of new and expensive pharmacological advancements. Evernorth's recent expansion of our industry first comprehensive weight management program illustrates the benefit of a more coordinated approach. Patients can now receive treatment with Wegovy, a promising new therapy for obesity and other weight management medications. And now with MDLIVE fully operational within our Evernorth business, MDLIVE physicians along with other Evernorth clinicians are available to help patients. This program expansion also includes personalized support services from health coaches, peer support groups, and curated digital apps. This weight management effort is the latest addition to our Evernote suite of SafeguardRX programs. As we're impacting 2020, patients enrolled in SafeguardRX to save more than $6 billion in aggregate. In Evernorth care solutions, we've experienced an increase in demand for our behavioral health solutions from customers and clients as well. In the past year and a half, it has brought heightened stress and other personal challenges, and we see many more people reaching out for help and services. Clients now more broadly understand that someone with a chronic condition is more likely to have a mental health or substance abuse related illness and individuals are feeling the additional mental and physical challenges associated with the pandemic. With our market leading behavioral health capabilities, we are driving more value to our Evernorth and Cigna medical clients and customers by providing the tools and services they need to address their mental wellbeing and deliver better, sustained long-term outcomes. Within our Cigna medical platform in U.S. Commercial, we are working closely with our employer clients to provide our integrated suite of solutions, designed to make their workforce healthier and more productive. We know that employees receiving health and wellbeing benefits through their employers are less likely to miss work because of poor health. Our recent study shows a significant impact of the 70 fewer percent days missed over a year. With our integrated approach, we strive to bring the right mix of solutions that reduce the workforce challenges many of our clients are facing and helping to support them to engage and retain their employees. And affordability is remained the primary focus across our entire portfolio, as it is in Cigna medical. Our clients continue to manage through an incredibly dynamic environment for their business and is becoming even more important that they can count on us with greater affordability for the healthcare programs. New and expensive pharmacological advancements are predominant contributor to this challenge. And we have been a leader here putting these treatments in the hands of those who need them at a more affordable price. For example, Remicade is treatment for chronic conditions, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis, while life changing can also impose significant financial burdens. One year of Remicade infusion costs about $30,000 on average, and as much as $70,000, depending on site of care. We recently launched a Cigna pharmacy program that shares prescription drug savings directly with patients who switched from Remicade to one of the approved biosimilars. More than 20% of eligible patients in consultation with their provider have already switched to lower cost preferred alternative medications. This program has an immediate benefit to clients who save at least 10% of the cost of the drug. And we've taken a leadership position here by supporting our patients with a $500 incentive. This is a great example of aligning interest. Over the longer term, we can drive even greater impact as biosimilars become a more prevalent part in the United States as helping us further improve affordability And in Cigna medical, we're actively working toward improving affordability by ensuring that our customers continue to have the access to the care they need and optimize their long-term health. For example, in Arizona, we conducted a highly targeted outreach program to our customers who are high risk due to chronic condition, yet who have not been vaccinated. The initial results are encouraging, and we're seeing positive increase in vaccination rates amongst these targeted individuals. We are now taking the learnings from that pilot into other locations across the United States, with a particular focus on increasing vaccination rates amongst those in most need. This broad range of examples illustrates how our comprehensive and strategic approach to helping our clients and customers address their most pressing health needs help us going forward. And in this dynamic environment, we will continue to expand the services we offer our clients and customers, and therefore, we see many more opportunities to create value for both our clients and customers, and as a result for your shareholders. It is clear that the strength of our medical and pharmacy offerings combined with our strategic agility has enabled us to continue to capture growth, even in the most dynamic environment by delivering differentiated value, by partnering and relentlessly innovating, and by expanding our addressable markets, as we broaden our reach to new geographies and through the introduction of a broader suite of solutions. When you combine this compelling growth potential, along with our significant operating cash flow generated by our service-based capital light model, we have confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets by achieving differentiated results, which include average annual revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continued to pay an attractive dividends, all while producing cumulative operating cash flow of approximately $50 billion through 2025. Relative to 2021, we remain committed to delivering full year EPS of at least $20.20. Now to briefly summarize. First, we recognize in an environment like this it's so challenging, we know that growth doesn't come easily. It has to be earned each and every day. Second, we have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and partnering and smartly expanding our addressable market to fuel sustained long-term growth, even in disrupted environment. And our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities across our three well position growth platforms, and importantly the strategic and capital flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter of 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 10% to $43.1 billion; adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion after tax; and adjusted earnings per share of $5.24. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Before I go into segment specific results, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes addressing the medical cost environment we are experiencing. Let me be clear. Our second quarter results and our full year outlook have been adversely impacted by elevated claim costs compared to our prior expectations. Despite this pressure, our diversified portfolio of businesses and multiple earnings levers drove second quarter adjusted earnings that exceeded our expectations at the enterprise level. Specifically within the second quarter, ongoing direct COVID-19 costs were above our expectations and non-COVID utilization returned more rapidly than we anticipated. During my comments today and in our Q&A, David and I will use the term baseline to refer to 2019 or pre-pandemic claim costs that will be trended forward for two years to 2021, to provide you with an estimate for what 2021 claim costs would have been in the absence of COVID-19. The return of non-COVID utilization has varied by both geography and customer group. For example, we saw the following within the second quarter: In U.S. Commercial, non-COVID costs were back to baseline level; while in Medicare Advantage, non-COVID costs accelerated from first quarter levels, but remain slightly below baseline for the second quarter. We expect to continue seeing elevated claim costs compared to our original expectations for the balance of 2021 within U.S. Medical. However, the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our multiple earnings levers, give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year EPS outlook of at least $20.20. Additionally, as we look forward to 2022, while we recognize the dynamic environment in which we operate, we expect another year of attractive growth driven by all three of our growth platforms. Now, I'd like to turn to our segment level results and then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $32.6 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 13% to $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by ongoing organic growth, driving both top and bottom line contributions and continued progress on a range of affordability initiatives for the benefit for our customers and clients. In the quarter, we also continued to make significant investments to support our ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $410 million during the quarter, a 13% increase over second quarter 2020, driven by strong organic growth, as well as the impact of vaccine volumes in the quarter. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong quarter, continuing to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving better-than-expected top and bottom line contribution to the enterprise. Turning to U.S. Medical. Second quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretext earnings were $1 billion. Overall, our second quarter U.S. Medical earnings reflected the impact of elevated claim costs, offset by favorability from operating expenses, non-recurring items and net investment income. Regarding our medical costs. We entered the second quarter expecting a continued decline in COVID-related claim costs and a gradual return in broader care consumption patterns toward more normalized levels. While these directional patterns did transpire, as I noted earlier, both direct COVID-19 costs and broader utilization levels were above our expectations for the second quarter. Direct COVID-19 costs were highest in April, decreasing throughout the second quarter, while non-COVID costs approximated baseline levels for the quarter. Both U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government total medical costs reflecting the combined impact of direct COVID-19 and non-COVID costs were above baseline for the quarter, with U.S. Commercial further above baseline as those customers returned to utilize the healthcare system at a slightly higher level. Given these developments, the second quarter medical care ratio was above our expectation. We now expect that the level of non-COVID costs we incurred toward the end of the second quarter will persist for the balance of the year. This coupled with the ongoing direct COVID-19 related costs we expect to incur has led us to raise our guidance for the full year 2021 medical care ratio. Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of 249,000 customers sequentially. The customer growth in the quarter was largely driven by new wins in middle market and growth in the individual business through the extended special enrollment periods, supported by continued strong retention across our portfolio. All-in. for U.S. Medical, we continue driving customer growth and expanding services, while remaining focused on delivering value and supporting our customers and clients in the dynamic environment. In our International markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $234 million. These results were approximately in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a second quarter adjusted loss of $331 million. Overall, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders with strong growth, reflecting contributions across our businesses, led by outperformance in Evernote, the diversified portfolio of Cigna businesses and the multiple avenues to create an ultimately capture value has allowed us to continue meeting our enterprise commitments despite ongoing uncertainties in the marketplace. Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 of at least $20.20. Before I walked through the outlook by segment, I'd like to frame the key drivers underlying this outlook. The updated components include an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses, and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Additionally, we now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $170 billion, representing growth of at least 9% from 2020, when excluding the divestiture of our group disability and life business. Within our outlook, we now expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $2.50 per share, primarily impacting our U.S. Medical business. This includes approximately 80% related to impacts on the medical care ratio and approximately 20% related to lower customer volumes due to economy driven enrollment dynamics. Finally, we now expect an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 7.5%, an improvement relative to our prior outlook. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% to 84%, driven by our updated medical cost expectations for the second half of 2021 as I previously discussed. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. All-in, for full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.20, with the underlying drivers being an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. I would highlight that we had some timing related items, which impacted cash flow from operations during the second quarter. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date, as of August 4th, 2021, we have repurchased about 18 million shares for about $4.1 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 344 million to 345 million shares. On July 28th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on September 23rd to shareholders of record as of September 8th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. Additionally, we acknowledged that the environment remains fluid as evidenced by the impact of elevated medical costs in the second quarter and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Even with this additional pressure, our diversified portfolio and multiple earnings levers have positioned us to achieve our outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients, and coworkers. We continue to expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth rate that will average 10% to 13% per year. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Appreciate all the thoughts there. On the increased outlook for the medical cost ratio and what's you're giving us relative to COVID and non-COVID, it looks like my math is right about two-thirds of the increase in MLR would be related to the COVID costs, given the $1.25, now it's $2.50 EPS headwind. And I guess that would mean the remaining is the non-COVID. I want to just confirm that. And would the COVID costs be spread relatively evenly over the course of the year, rest of the year Q2, Q3, Q4, and then does that become a tailwind for 2022 is hopefully that reverses.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning A.J. It\u2019s Brian. So, a few different questions in there. I'll try to give you the overall picture. So, as I said my prepared comments there, we now anticipate about a $2.50 earnings per share headwind in 2021 associated with COVID and of that approximately 80% impacts to medical care ratio, and approximately 20% is related to enrollment levels being depressed here in 2021. Focusing on the $2 per share COVID-related headwind, that's impacting the medical care ratio, there's a few components underlying that. So, one would be the impact of Medicare Advantage risk adjuster revenue headwinds here in 2021. The other component of it is the level of total cost of care that we're experiencing in 2021 compared to our prior expectations, which includes both COVID direct costs. And it also includes non-COVID costs that returned earlier than we anticipated during the year here. And so, I wouldn't necessarily parse the two-thirds, one-third, the way that you did, but rather look at the total cost picture, be more elevated in comparison to what we had previously expected. COVID costs were highest for us in the first quarter. Within the second quarter, they were higher in April than they were in May and June. And we expect for the balance of the year that COVID costs will run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year. So, that's what's embedded in our outlook. And as I said, the non-COVID utilization, we're anticipating to run at approximately baseline levels for the back half of the year. That plus the COVID costs we expect to incur leads us to all-in cost levels at slightly above our baseline for the back half of 2021. As it relates to what we expect to unwind heading into 2022, again, if you parse apart the components of that $2 I was just making reference to, the Medicare Advantage risk adjuster headwind, we expect to fully recover in 2022. So, between our bid strategies and the operational activities we're seeing, we have a full confidence that we'll fully recover that component. The components related to total cost of care, we expect to recover a portion of that in 2022. And so, a portion of that will come through pricing actions. A portion of that will come through clinical management activities and a portion of that we expect to be a little bit of natural abatement in aggravated costs between 2021 and 2022. So, we're currently estimating that about half of that $2 per share headwind will come back in 2022 in the form of incremental earnings. So, think about $1 of the $2.50 EPS headwind returning into the P&L in 2002.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Just staying on that topic. I think last quarter you had also suggested that, growth would be at or above the high-end in 2022. I think off that 2020 baseline, I guess, is that still the case? So the way to think about it is sort of at or above the high-end, and then add back that dollar that you just said Brian? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Ralph, good morning. It's David. So, as we think about 2022, clearly, early to give you a detailed guidance, but let me try to walk through the moving parts as we think about 2022. Underlying our outlook will be strong base earnings growth, contributions from ongoing capital deployment, and the recovery of some of the headwind that Brian articulated. There'll be an offset to that. Partially offsetting that will be, the lack of some of the non-run-ratable items we're realizing in our 2021, at least $20.20 EPS outlook. So when you take it all together, we expect 2022 will be another strong year for us. As relates to growth rates, the way I ask you to think about that is, first off, I take at least $20.20. When we adjust that for the non-renewable items, we would expect to grow at the high-end of our 10% to 13% range. Another way of thinking about it, if you take at least $20.20 outlook for 2020, we would expect to grow at least 10% on that. So, a net new item, that was the non-run-ratable items that we'll have in 2022, but an attractive growth rate on either parameter, as we expect to have another strong year for 2022.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit about the individual business, which has been volatile for some companies and the extent to which you saw that and how much that may or may not be contributing to headwinds you are seeing?\nDavid Cordani: Matthew, good morning. It's David. From the individual business portfolio, as you know, we've been active in that marketplace since its inception. And after a few years of test and learn and the marketplace stabilizing itself, we sought and began to more systematically expand our growth and that carries into the current year. As relates to the performance in the current year, we have some attractive growth in that business, both underlying fundamental growth, as well as growth contribution from the SEP period. And as it relates to the core of your question on performance, I'd asked you to think about the underlying -- what we're seeing the underlying performance of that book of business is similar to the trends and impact that Brian articulated before. So, we see an uptick in utilization within that book of business, more approximating from a non-COVID standpoint, baseline activity with some additional utilization on the COVID side of the equation. And lastly, our early look at the SEP, special enrollment period, additional lives, those lives are performing similar to other special enrollment period lives we've observed before. So, some of the MLR that we're seeing across our broader portfolio is showing through in the individual business, but not up proportion in either way from the overall behavior of that book.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I want to try to squeeze in a question and a follow-up here. So, first, you talked about 2Q being above baseline in terms of non-COVID costs in U.S. Commercial. I just want to ask how far above baseline versus that 100%. And did you say you expected to return down to do a 100% or do you expect that to continue at that level into the back half of the year?  And then my follow-up was to Ralph's question, you're -- I just want to make sure we understand 2022 here. Are you saying they're going to grow 10% off 2020 or $20.20 plus a $1, or is the 10% the total number and David, you keep talking to these non-recurring costs. Can you just delineate what those are and how -- what's driving them and how big the non-recurring items are for this year? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Justin. This is Brian. I'll start and then David to pile on here. So, on the first part of your question there, if I misspoke, I apologize. For the second quarter our non-COVID utilization or commercial was essentially at baseline, that plus the direct COVID-19 related costs we incurred put the total cost picture above baseline, but the non-COVID utilization was at baseline. For the back half of the year within our commercial business, we're expecting that non-COVID utilization will continue to run at baseline and we will incur direct COVID-19 related costs, but at a lower level than what we saw in the first half of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a bit the commentary around commercial and the assumptions on the back half. Relative to the non-recurring items that you asked about, you can think about those as largely being SG&A oriented, with the bulk of it being associated with litigation from prior years where we had some favorable developments in the quarter, that allowed us to recognize some gains there. So, boxing that just directionally, you should think of it as about $150 million after tax. So think of it in the range of $0.45, $0.50 earnings per share in terms of the favorable benefit that we've seen here in 2021. David, you want to clarify on the 2022 commentary.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. So, Justin, crosswalk again. First from prior dialogue, as you recall, we would have talked about base earnings, capital deployment, and a recovery of COVID headwind as contributor to our 2022 expectations for ourselves. And that remains, the base performance, the capital deployment and recovery of COVID headwind. As Brian articulated with the COVID headwind, that opportunity is a little greater now for 2022 than it was a quarter of ago from that perspective. The net new item is what Brian walked through, which are the non-reoccurring items. And he gave you approximate order of magnitude. So, again, to repeat to the specific part of your question, we believe today, if you take the at least $20.20 that we will deliver for this year, our growth rate will be at least 10%. We believe if you take the -- at least $20.20 and adjusted for those non-reoccurring items, that we referenced -- that Brian just referenced, the growth rate will approximate 13% or so. So, those are the moving parts relative to our expectations for 2022 on either convention another year for strong, attractive balance performance.\nJustin Lake: And David, just to be clear, that includes the dollar, so you are growing 10% with the dollar.\nDavid Cordani: No. It includes, Justin, the dollar. So, let's come back -- and previously we would have talked about baseline earnings, capital deployment and the recovery of the headwind. That's what took us to the high-end of the range versus within the range. It currently -- the expectation includes that, but the dollar is somewhat offset by the lack of the non-run-ratable items next year. So, on an all-in basis, we'll grow in the 10% to 13% range, depending on the convention you use, either the $20.20, we will grow at least 10% all-in, or if you look at it, excluding the non-recurring items, that Brian just articulated, about $0.50 we will grow at about 13% all-in.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Great. Thanks very much and good morning. David, I'm just wondered if I can ask about the PBM, was really strong in the quarter. First, can you talk about the 2022 selling season and how that plays into the outlook that that you're talking about right now? And then secondly, can you tell us that the number of vaccines that are included in that, that script count, just want to get a better idea of what you're seeing on overall script count, including vaccines?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Lisa. I'll talk about the growth outlook in the environment and then I'll ask Brian to come back in and talk about the script count, specifically the vaccine. First, we're very pleased with the performance of the Evernorth portfolio. The durable nature of that and an environment of disruption provides some diversification within the portfolio and the service delivery for our clients, health plan clients, corporate clients, government clients remains quite strong. As it relates to the underlying growth rate, our growth in 2021 outstanding for that portfolio and we'll continue to see expected growth for 2022. As we discussed previously, we've known for some time that we have lack of renewal of two health plan clients. So, we knew that, and even with that, we will grow again in 2022 at an attractive rate. We also recognize that given our strong performance, we've been able to maintain appropriate pricing discipline, as we looked at the 2022 environment. So, take it as a whole, an active dynamic year for 2022. We'd expect another strong year of retention, even acknowledging those health plan clients in the mid-90s. And we would expect strong underlying growth of the Evernorth portfolio. Brian, I'll ask you to talk about the vaccine volumes within our scripts for the quarter.\nBrian Evanko: Sure. Morning, Lisa. So, in the second quarter, we fulfilled 9 million of vaccine related scripts. So, out of the 410 million adjusted scripts that we fulfilled in the quarter, about 9 million of those were associated with a vaccine, obviously that's not something to run rate, given we would not expect that level to persist for the balance of the year, but 2%, 3% of the total script volume.\nLisa Gill: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.\nSteve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess, just back on the medical cost for a moment, just curious if you have any additional color on the medical costs ran versus baseline by cost category, for example, inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, et cetera. And some MCO have called up, behavioral health and also diagnostic and lab work as cost categories that are trending above baseline. I'm curious if you're seeing those same trends as well. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. Let me provide a little overview and I'll ask Brian to provide some specifics of what we're seeing in terms of some of the specific categories of utilization. You did call out an important category we've unequivocally seen, and I noted in my prepared comments, the mental health or behavioral and substance abuse category is growing. We see more individuals needing and utilizing those services, and appropriately needing and utilizing those services given the environment and our portfolio is really well-positioned to provide that level of support necessary. And we believe that it's not only appropriate required. It will provide some intermediate and long-term benefit to those individuals, obviously to clients, as well as to ourselves on a sustainable basis. Beyond that, we've seen an uptick in -- from prior levels and uptick in both inpatient and outpatient surgeries in the non-COVID category. And as Brian articulated, that categories more broadly approximated baseline levels, and we've assumed that we'll remain at that for the second half of the year. I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color in terms of some of the insights we're seeing in terms of the more detailed utilization patterns.\nBrian Evanko: Yeah. Sure, David and good morning, Steve. So, just to reiterate David's point, surgeries in particular were a hotspot for us, both in terms of inpatient, outpatient activity in the quarter. We also saw overall outpatient and professional utilization pick up pretty meaningfully in the quarter. Emergency room utilization, radiology remained below baseline in the quarter and kind of within these different categories, there was also some state of service shift, which is a good thing over time. We saw inpatient shift outpatient, particularly for some lower acuity procedures. And we saw some of the emergency room utilization shift, urgent care centers and physician offices, which we view as a good thing from the standpoint of optimizing, like to care. On your point about behavioral health, a metric that I'll share with you just relative to prior to the pandemic. Within our U.S. Commercial book, in 2019 about 8% of our customers were utilizing behavioral health services. And as you know, we have an industry-leading capability in this space. This year, that number is going to be up almost 40%. So, we're going to have nearly 11% of our customers this year, utilizing behavioral health services, which we think is a good thing for the long-term. It's putting a little bit of pressure on the P&L this year, but we believe it's a good thing for the long-term, and our recent acquisition of MDLIVE offers us the opportunity to further synergize that given the demand for virtual behavioral health has grown meaningfully over the course of the pandemic.\nSteve Valiquette: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm interested if you can just break down the 20% of the COVID headwind that's from the lower customer volumes, maybe a little more insight into that in terms of some of the key customer segments for you in terms of where you're seeing more of that drag. And then, also just want to -- just confirm on the $4 billion revenue raised. If you can also just break that down by segments. It feels like Evernorth is probably the bulk of that growth, but just want to confirm that in terms of the segment, the breakdown of the $4 billion of revenue heads. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Scott. It's David. Let me speak to the headwind and I'll Brian speak to the revenue raise. If I understand your question correctly, you're coming out the portion of the headwind that is non-MCR related. And broadly, we see the impact of the pandemic on employment levels within the commercial population broadly. We had previously called that out as a headwind. We previously called that as a headwind that we believed would return as a favorable tailwind over time. We're taking the posture right now that given the current employment environment, that headwind will more likely persist or set otherwise that's the baseline with which to grow off of. We'll continue to grow no doubt, but that's the baseline to grow off of as we observed the marketplace and the overall employment levels beginning to move forward, but more slowly than anticipated in a variety of sectors. So, view it as disenrollment and/or aggregate employment levels, and the requisite level of changing those employment levels, having and flowing at a slower rate, given the prolonged pandemic. I'll let Brian speak a bit more towards the $4 billion revenue raise.\nBrian Evanko: Sure. Morning, Scott. So, relative to the revenue outlook, obviously we're very pleased with the aggregate growth for the company this year. Of the $4 billion, you should think of the lion's share of that being driven by Evernorth. So think of it as roughly 75-25 with the other segments and in totality Evernorth is on track for a year where both revenue and earnings will grow above well -- above our long-term average annual expectation 4% to 6%. So, we're really pleased with the performance of that business.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess, the higher utilization that you're seeing this quarter, I guess, is internally surprising given what other companies are seeing so far this earning season. I guess, the question I'd have though is, what gives you confidence that this higher trend is not the beginning of an overall -- or this higher cost in the quarter is not the beginning of an overall higher trend that makes 2022 pricing at risk. I guess, what gives you that comment? I would think that a faster return to normal in Q2 would be the first thing you saw before you saw above average trend overall. So, why isn't that a concern?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin. It\u2019s Brian. So, appreciate the question. If you think about how the second quarter unfolded, I think this is instructive for how we think about the back half of the year and into 2022. So, April, we saw the highest level of COVID costs. As I said earlier, those tracked downward pretty meaningfully in May, in June and the total cost of care when you combine the COVID and non-COVID costs together in the months of May and June is more in line with what we're expecting for the back half of 2021 and as we step into 2022. So, for those reasons, based on the more emergent data, we feel better about the next 18 months as compared to the first four months of the year where we had particularly elevated costs in our book. David, anything you want to add?\nDavid Cordani: Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. The only item I would add is, as we think about our book of business, approximately two-thirds of our risk business is yet to be priced for 2022. So, as you know, it's not all -- that portfolio of our business is not all one, one or front end loaded from that standpoint. So, we have the opportunity be appropriately responsive as the marketplace changes, but the underlying assumptions that Brian articulated in the medical cost pattern are the most important part of it.\nKevin Fischbeck: But I guess you're saying that you got back to normal faster in Q2 than your original guidance, assumed you would get back to normal sort of price. So, again, that feels to be like the trajectory is higher. Why would it get higher and then level off, I guess, in the back half of the year?\nDavid Cordani: Sure. The underlying question comes back to, as Brian broke up -- broke out the portions of it. We essentially are looking at an environment in the second half of the year where the medical cost environment will be slightly above baseline. And the pieces of that are that the non-COVID or the -- call, traditional parts of medical costs approximately baseline in the commercial portfolio and above and beyond that there's some additional load for COVID. So, one would have to believe that either A, the non-COVID costs are going to run above baseline for some reason that they haven't to date when we look at the way we built up the policy for baseline and/or that the additional COVID costs that we're saying are additive to that, will be materially greater, right? So, we acknowledge it's the fluid environment beyond a shadow of a doubt, but we believe that the estimate we've made for the step-up in aggregate for the rest of the year to run slightly above baseline, is an appropriate assessment based upon the pattern we saw in the end of the first quarter and the way in which the second quarter was evolved and developed and as I noted that we have about two-thirds of the risk business yet to be priced for 2022.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little about the MLR. I know you guys stopped disclosing that MLR by segment a while back, but I was wondering if you just give us some color on the changes in the MLR in the second quarter, even the first half of the year for the commercial book, and maybe specifically that individual book of business, if that was different than the overall commercial? And then relative to Medicare Advantage, and maybe as a side, how much of the MA increase was risk adjuster related versus medical cost related?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Josh. This is Brian. So, a few different components there, the question. Big picture compared to our expectations, I would encourage you to think about the three books of business, meaning the commercial risk, the individual exchange, and the Medicare Advantage, as all being approximately off by the same amount compared to our expectations in terms of total claim costs. So, I'd start there in terms of, we are not seeing one being really disproportionately impacted relative to our prior expectations. They're all off by, call it, that 200 basis points or so that changed in our MCR guide. The Medicare Advantage business though in 2021 is further weighed down by the risk adjustment revenue headwinds. So, you should view the margins on the Medicare Advantage business as being particularly low relative to what our long-term expectations are. And as we step into 2022, we would expect margin expansion on each of those books of business off of what we're experiencing here in 2021. As it relates to the risk adjuster headwind, that's a component of the $2 per share headwind. We haven't specifically sized that. It's certainly a less than half of that. I would note, we recently received our mid-year settlement from CMS, which was favorable to our expectations, which gives us a further confidence in our ability to fully recover that headwind in 2022.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nRajiv Garg - UBS: Hi. Good morning. This is Rajiv Garg on for Kevin. Just wanted to quickly follow-up and see if there was any updates to your longer term targets provided on your Investor Day? Or are you still comfortable with those overall? Thank you.\nBrian Evanko: Sure. Good morning. Our longer term targets are consistent, and we remain committed to them. And to remind everybody, it\u2019s our attractive revenue growth rate of 6% to 8%, our EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% with the dividend above and beyond that. And our outlook of operating cash flow generation from current year to 2025 of approximately $50 billion. Those numbers are on average over a prolonged period of time. And as we've identified at Investor Day as well, as you look back over the last decade, we have a track record of delivering against those targets and objectives.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Caliendo. Our last -- our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Good morning, guys. I have a question on strategic capital deployment. And if you could just talk through a little bit of long-term, like five years out or so, what do you think is the mix of businesses you\u2019re expecting thinking of kind of employer managed care, government managed care, PBM and other services? And as you\u2019re out looking at things and contemplating that, what\u2019s the landscape like as far as attractiveness of opportunities, just availability of targets and the like. And within that value-based care, home care, Medicaid, are there any new views on categories that you\u2019d be interested in?\nDavid Cordani: Lance, good morning. It\u2019s David. Appreciate the forward-looking orientation relative to that. To answer your question, we got a ground back into our portfolio. The three platforms we have, which we feel very positively about, the services based platform within Evernorth, the U.S. Medical platform, both Commercial and Government, and then our International platform. We see attractive growth opportunities organically and inorganically in all three as we look to the future. Specifically, you start -- your real thoughtful question in terms of kind of apportionment five years out. We don\u2019t have a rigid target five years out that we want X percent in category A or Y percent in category Z. But however, we do see an environment where the services portion of our portfolio will continue to grow at an accelerated rate. We see the right to win, the ability to create value and our strategic position there for the multiple client segments we\u2019re able to serve there as being quite attractive, and you should expect this to continue to grow our pharmacy, our care, our benefits and our intelligence capability to be able to bring to bear against that. Secondly, we\u2019ve continued to call out U.S. Government as an attractive growth segment and that will transpire both organically and inorganically, as opportunities present themselves. And thirdly, we continue to see targeted opportunities in our International portfolio as attractive growth opportunities. On a final note, you articulated examples of home care, otherwise, et cetera, I won\u2019t call out any one precise example. But I\u2019ll step back and remind you, as we\u2019ve talked about it, we see what we call alternative sites of care. So, virtual -- longitudinal virtual, polychronic, home care, coordinated home care as attractive additional growth opportunities within our service portfolio, and we continue to extend ourselves and expand ourselves within that space. So, multiple strategic alternatives. Second, strong platforms to build off of. Third, the capital flexibility to be able to grow in multiple attractive markets that you appropriately called out. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Our next question comes from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, a couple of questions here. First of all, on the acuity levels, I mean, I understand that sort of new members are coming in at similar profile to existing. But are you seeing any increase in acuity for the existing book? I noted last quarter you talked about the preventive cartelization at pre-pandemic levels. So, just wondering -- trying to understand how it compares in second quarter and what are you seeing in terms of acuity. And then, just as a follow-up on your point on expansion into U.S. Government, just kind of like if you can give us maybe a little bit more direction in terms you looking more at Medicare versus Medicaid. And should we think about expansion on the medical side, or is it more in sort of the adjacent areas and more sort of kind of like the PBM side, the pharmacy service that could be expanded into sort of the Medicare and Medicaid market? Thank you.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Ricky. It\u2019s Brian. I\u2019ll take the acuity portion of the question and David to tackle the government component. So, big picture, we\u2019re not yet seeing signs of any meaningfully higher acuity amongst our customer base. Part of that due to the focus we\u2019ve had on preventive care, as you indicated in your question, as well as appropriate behavioral health utilization as we talked about earlier. There are a variety of metrics that we use to track this. And just one really specific one I\u2019ll give you, we track within our commercial book of business when we have new cancer diagnosis, how many of them are at a metastatic stage when they\u2019re first diagnosed. And so, prior to the pandemic, if you look at the top five cancer types, we saw 38% to 39% of these in a metastatic stage when they presented to us. In 2021, we\u2019re in that same range, 38% to 39%. So, that\u2019s an indicator that we track one of many that suggests we do not yet have those signs of acuity spikes. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re also seeing a site of service shifts in the book of business, which is a mitigant over time to the potential for a QE coming back into the book. David, maybe you want to talk a little bit about the government part of the question.\nDavid Cordani: Sure, Ricky. Good morning. The short answer is we see expansion opportunities in both the U.S. Medical side of the equation, as well as in the Evernorth services side. So, more specifically, within the U.S. Medical portfolio organically, we see and are continuing to deliver and pursue additional growth opportunities for both our Medicare Advantage portfolio in existing geographies as well as, as we\u2019ve discussed before, our continued expansion of those geographies and leveraging our broader product portfolio and platform, as well as in our exchange portfolio as we continue to expand our individual exchange portfolio, which we view as more government business versus not. On the services side, you referenced pharmacy unequivocally, but expanded beyond pharmacy to care and benefit management services, as well as intelligent services. For example, as we look to continue to serve our expanding portfolio of health plan clients, they have diverse portfolios that they serve, commercial obviously, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange and otherwise. That\u2019s an important part of our growth chassis as we go forward with dedicated resources. And then ultimately, direct to government contractor relationships as well. So, we see attractive growth opportunities in the government space, both off of the health plan side of the business in the Cigna medical portfolio, as well as in the services side of the business through Evernorth.\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Goldwasser. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question.\nJohn Ransom: Hey, I\u2019m going to ask about a happy topic, because you guys have been beaten up this morning, and I want you to end on a happy note. The -- if we go back particular time period, 12, 18, 24 months, obviously, the PBM side of Evernorth has done a lot better than I think anybody expected. Can you kind of point to the top one, two or three reasons why that is? And then secondly, if we think about the profit model of the PBM, how has that shifted away from kind of adjudication straight dollars and toward things like mail order and kind of backward fees into pharma that presumably might be a bit more sticky than some of the ways of making money? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Good morning, John. It\u2019s David. I'll start relative to your question. And I appreciate the tone, but candidly, I don\u2019t feel beaten up. These are dynamic and challenging times. And we\u2019re proud of the fact that our portfolio, our diverse portfolio can perform in this environment and importantly, deliver for our clients, our customers and patients, while we deliver our responsibilities from a shareholder perspective. But I appreciate the tone of your question. Now, specifically, as you go back in time, when we brought this portfolio together in terms of the companies, we viewed obviously that we had an opportunity to bring in a leading PBM portfolio of services, but it was broader than that. Secondly, we viewed, as we talk about now, that pharmacological innovation was a big part of the future of healthcare. And the acceleration of innovation is what we\u2019re seeing today through a whole variety of things, gene therapy, specialty, medications evolving, biosimilars, et cetera. And hence, if you\u2019re going to be helping individuals with their overall healthcare needs, being a leader in pharmacy services is mission-critical. We also saw the opportunity to expand that portfolio through a broader services platform, which we did through Evernorth, and then continue to feed that broader services platform for health plan clients, for corporate clients, for our government clients, et cetera. And as we\u2019ve noted -- both Brian and I have noted, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance within the portfolio and the service we\u2019re delivering. And importantly, we continue to invest in that portfolio at an accelerating rate relative to expanding products, services, capabilities, as well as our reach. Now as it relates to the profit model, the primary mechanisms would articulate for you to think about is back to the time you referenced, we acknowledge that the financing models were going to change, and we didn\u2019t resist that. We offer choice. We offer choice in terms of how purchasers or clients want to finance their offering. And we\u2019ve evolved, for example, with a higher percentage of pass-through arrangements for clients in the PBM services from well less than 50% to 50% to well greater than 50% over three cycles. And we\u2019ve been able to evolve our service based capabilities and our value creation capabilities for the benefit of clients. Secondly, we continue to press for more aligned relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers on the clinical outcomes, not just the consumptions. We know that broadly in the industry is value based programs, but think about them as aligned programs. And then lastly, as the biosimilars start to evolve at a more rapid rate, the positioning of our company to have the clinical depth, the coordination of clinical services, the manufacturer relationships and importantly, the medical physician relationships are mission-critical. And as I use the Remicade example, all those come to bear, because it\u2019s a patient-by-patient decision made with a practicing physician relative to the choices and alternatives. So, again, I appreciate your question. We\u2019re pleased with the performance, but maybe even more importantly than that underlying your question, we\u2019re delighted with the strategic position that the platform gives us right now to continue to drive growth and create value going forward.\nJohn Ransom: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Ransom. Our next question comes from Mr. David Windley with Jefferies. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, David, if I go back to your growth construct and think about a $20.20 minus the one-timers and grow that by 13%, it would seem that the dollar recovery for next year represents maybe 40% of that growth next year. Can you talk about the factors that you see at this point that would be limiting on your core business apart from the dollar. So, it looks like that would be mid to high single digit growth including capital deployment. And so, that would obviously be below your trend line. What are the factors limiting the core business apart from the dollar? Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Dave, good morning. So, again, it\u2019s early for the detailed 2022 guidance, but taking the spirit of your question, it ultimately is going to come down to two things. Rate and pace of evolution of the cost environment -- medical cost environment, and rate and pace of our investment portfolio decisions within the organization positioning us for the future. We have a track record of sustained investment in the organization for long-term growth. We have -- as Brian articulated earlier, we have multiple growth and profit levers, and we\u2019ll seek to make trade-offs within that and ensure that we seek to deliver an attractive, sustainable result. So, I think those are the two major points I\u2019d ask you to think about. I talked about the growth rate in framework of at least. So, we weren\u2019t providing guidance to pencil a number rather how we\u2019re thinking about the growth platforms and trajectory. And there\u2019s nothing in our underlying business portfolio today. I\u2019ll leave you with, there\u2019s nothing in our underlying business portfolio today that suggests that the organic underlying growth of our earnings will be demonstrably different unless we determine we\u2019re going to make a trade-off in terms of rate and pace of investment within the portfolio or there\u2019s an exogenous impact for the industry on the cost side of the equation. We\u2019re just trying to frame the at least growth rates off of what we know now mid-year.\nDavid Windley: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah. Hi. Sorry to come back to a more near term and less happy topic. Just thinking about the back half discussion and sort of the progression from where we were in MLR in the second quarter to the back half. It looks like you need MLR to decline a couple of hundred bps sequentially to kind of make that work. So, just in terms of thinking about it, it\u2019d be really helpful if you could potentially quantify what you\u2019re thinking about COVID costs in the back half of the year relative to the second quarter. And how we should balance that against sort of the typical deductible seasonality that we\u2019d expect to be pushing up MLR sequentially in a more normal year? Thank you.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Steve. It\u2019s Brian. So, I would encourage you to think of the year in two halves, one half and two half. So, the first half, we ran at 83.6% MCR, and we\u2019re modeling the back half to perform at approximately that same level if you use the mid-point of our guidance. So, rather than looking at quarter-by-quarter, because there\u2019s quite a bit of variability that\u2019s transpired in the different months. But big picture, the first half of the year, we ran a few points above baseline in total when you combine the effect of COVID and non-COVID utilization together. For the back half of the year, we\u2019re projecting to run slightly above the baseline in totality and that\u2019s comprised of non-COVID utilization running approximately at baseline, plus COVID utilization on top of that. To your question on how does that pattern relative to what we saw in the first half? You should think of the direct COVID-19 related costs as being the highest in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter and we\u2019re modeling slightly lower than that for the back half of the year on direct COVID-19 related costs. So, those pieces get you to that overall expectation of slightly above baseline for the back half of the year, and that essentially offsets the seasonality we would typically see in the MCR pattern for our book of business.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. I\u2019ll be brief. I want to thank everybody for joining our call. And I just want to reinforce two points. First, I'm appreciative and proud of our more than 70,000 coworkers and their dedication to working to change our customers' lives for the better every day. They continue to rise to the challenges in the moment by helping our clients, our customers, our patients, working with our partners and in our communities to drive positive change. And second, we continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and our well-positioned three portfolios, and the strength of our strategic framework, given our results and our outlook. With that, I ask you to have a good day, and we look forward to our future conversations. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna second quarter 2021 results review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna second quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business. And I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for second quarter of 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 10% to $43.1 billion; adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion after tax; and adjusted earnings per share of $5.24. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with solid contributions across our businesses. Before I go into segment specific results, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes addressing the medical cost environment we are experiencing. Let me be clear. Our second quarter results and our full year outlook have been adversely impacted by elevated claim costs compared to our prior expectations. Despite this pressure, our diversified portfolio of businesses and multiple earnings levers drove second quarter adjusted earnings that exceeded our expectations at the enterprise level. Specifically within the second quarter, ongoing direct COVID-19 costs were above our expectations and non-COVID utilization returned more rapidly than we anticipated. During my comments today and in our Q&A, David and I will use the term baseline to refer to 2019 or pre-pandemic claim costs that will be trended forward for two years to 2021, to provide you with an estimate for what 2021 claim costs would have been in the absence of COVID-19. The return of non-COVID utilization has varied by both geography and customer group. For example, we saw the following within the second quarter: In U.S. Commercial, non-COVID costs were back to baseline level; while in Medicare Advantage, non-COVID costs accelerated from first quarter levels, but remain slightly below baseline for the second quarter. We expect to continue seeing elevated claim costs compared to our original expectations for the balance of 2021 within U.S. Medical. However, the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our multiple earnings levers, give us the confidence to reaffirm our full year EPS outlook of at least $20.20. Additionally, as we look forward to 2022, while we recognize the dynamic environment in which we operate, we expect another year of attractive growth driven by all three of our growth platforms. Now, I'd like to turn to our segment level results and then provide an update on the details of our outlook, as well as our capital positioning. Regarding our segments. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $32.6 billion, and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 13% to $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2020. Evernorth's strong results in the quarter were driven by ongoing organic growth, driving both top and bottom line contributions and continued progress on a range of affordability initiatives for the benefit for our customers and clients. In the quarter, we also continued to make significant investments to support our ongoing growth, including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $410 million during the quarter, a 13% increase over second quarter 2020, driven by strong organic growth, as well as the impact of vaccine volumes in the quarter. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong quarter, continuing to create differentiated value for clients and customers, while driving better-than-expected top and bottom line contribution to the enterprise. Turning to U.S. Medical. Second quarter adjusted revenues were $10.5 billion and adjusted pretext earnings were $1 billion. Overall, our second quarter U.S. Medical earnings reflected the impact of elevated claim costs, offset by favorability from operating expenses, non-recurring items and net investment income. Regarding our medical costs. We entered the second quarter expecting a continued decline in COVID-related claim costs and a gradual return in broader care consumption patterns toward more normalized levels. While these directional patterns did transpire, as I noted earlier, both direct COVID-19 costs and broader utilization levels were above our expectations for the second quarter. Direct COVID-19 costs were highest in April, decreasing throughout the second quarter, while non-COVID costs approximated baseline levels for the quarter. Both U.S. Commercial and U.S. Government total medical costs reflecting the combined impact of direct COVID-19 and non-COVID costs were above baseline for the quarter, with U.S. Commercial further above baseline as those customers returned to utilize the healthcare system at a slightly higher level. Given these developments, the second quarter medical care ratio was above our expectation. We now expect that the level of non-COVID costs we incurred toward the end of the second quarter will persist for the balance of the year. This coupled with the ongoing direct COVID-19 related costs we expect to incur has led us to raise our guidance for the full year 2021 medical care ratio. Turning to membership. We ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers, an increase of 249,000 customers sequentially. The customer growth in the quarter was largely driven by new wins in middle market and growth in the individual business through the extended special enrollment periods, supported by continued strong retention across our portfolio. All-in. for U.S. Medical, we continue driving customer growth and expanding services, while remaining focused on delivering value and supporting our customers and clients in the dynamic environment. In our International markets business, second quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $234 million. These results were approximately in line with our expectations. Corporate and other operations delivered a second quarter adjusted loss of $331 million. Overall, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders with strong growth, reflecting contributions across our businesses, led by outperformance in Evernote, the diversified portfolio of Cigna businesses and the multiple avenues to create an ultimately capture value has allowed us to continue meeting our enterprise commitments despite ongoing uncertainties in the marketplace. Now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full year 2021 of at least $20.20. Before I walked through the outlook by segment, I'd like to frame the key drivers underlying this outlook. The updated components include an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses, and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Additionally, we now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $170 billion, representing growth of at least 9% from 2020, when excluding the divestiture of our group disability and life business. Within our outlook, we now expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $2.50 per share, primarily impacting our U.S. Medical business. This includes approximately 80% related to impacts on the medical care ratio and approximately 20% related to lower customer volumes due to economy driven enrollment dynamics. Finally, we now expect an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 7.5%, an improvement relative to our prior outlook. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.8 billion, representing growth of at least 8% over 2020, reflecting the significant value we create for our customers and clients. For U.S. Medical, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.5 billion. Underlying this updated outlook, we now expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 83% to 84%, driven by our updated medical cost expectations for the second half of 2021 as I previously discussed. Regarding total medical customers, we continue to expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. All-in, for full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.20, with the underlying drivers being an increase in expected earnings from Evernorth, a decrease in expected earnings from U.S. Medical driven by a higher medical care ratio, a more favorable outlook for operating expenses and other contributions that are net favorable for the year. Now moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to drive strong cash flows and returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long-term growth and innovation. I would highlight that we had some timing related items, which impacted cash flow from operations during the second quarter. For full year 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well-performing businesses. Year-to-date, as of August 4th, 2021, we have repurchased about 18 million shares for about $4.1 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 344 million to 345 million shares. On July 28th, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on September 23rd to shareholders of record as of September 8th. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the second quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. Additionally, we acknowledged that the environment remains fluid as evidenced by the impact of elevated medical costs in the second quarter and on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Even with this additional pressure, our diversified portfolio and multiple earnings levers have positioned us to achieve our outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients, and coworkers. We continue to expect 2021 full year adjusted earnings of at least $20.20 per share and have continued confidence in delivering our long-term EPS growth rate that will average 10% to 13% per year. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning A.J. It's Brian. So, a few different questions in there. I'll try to give you the overall picture. So, as I said my prepared comments there, we now anticipate about a $2.50 earnings per share headwind in 2021 associated with COVID and of that approximately 80% impacts to medical care ratio, and approximately 20% is related to enrollment levels being depressed here in 2021. Focusing on the $2 per share COVID-related headwind, that's impacting the medical care ratio, there's a few components underlying that. So, one would be the impact of Medicare Advantage risk adjuster revenue headwinds here in 2021. The other component of it is the level of total cost of care that we're experiencing in 2021 compared to our prior expectations, which includes both COVID direct costs. And it also includes non-COVID costs that returned earlier than we anticipated during the year here. And so, I wouldn't necessarily parse the two-thirds, one-third, the way that you did, but rather look at the total cost picture, be more elevated in comparison to what we had previously expected. COVID costs were highest for us in the first quarter. Within the second quarter, they were higher in April than they were in May and June. And we expect for the balance of the year that COVID costs will run at a lower level than they did in the first half of the year. So, that's what's embedded in our outlook. And as I said, the non-COVID utilization, we're anticipating to run at approximately baseline levels for the back half of the year. That plus the COVID costs we expect to incur leads us to all-in cost levels at slightly above our baseline for the back half of 2021. As it relates to what we expect to unwind heading into 2022, again, if you parse apart the components of that $2 I was just making reference to, the Medicare Advantage risk adjuster headwind, we expect to fully recover in 2022. So, between our bid strategies and the operational activities we're seeing, we have a full confidence that we'll fully recover that component. The components related to total cost of care, we expect to recover a portion of that in 2022. And so, a portion of that will come through pricing actions. A portion of that will come through clinical management activities and a portion of that we expect to be a little bit of natural abatement in aggravated costs between 2021 and 2022. So, we're currently estimating that about half of that $2 per share headwind will come back in 2022 in the form of incremental earnings. So, think about $1 of the $2.50 EPS headwind returning into the P&L in 2002. Good morning, Justin. This is Brian. I'll start and then David to pile on here. So, on the first part of your question there, if I misspoke, I apologize. For the second quarter our non-COVID utilization or commercial was essentially at baseline, that plus the direct COVID-19 related costs we incurred put the total cost picture above baseline, but the non-COVID utilization was at baseline. For the back half of the year within our commercial business, we're expecting that non-COVID utilization will continue to run at baseline and we will incur direct COVID-19 related costs, but at a lower level than what we saw in the first half of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a bit the commentary around commercial and the assumptions on the back half. Relative to the non-recurring items that you asked about, you can think about those as largely being SG&A oriented, with the bulk of it being associated with litigation from prior years where we had some favorable developments in the quarter, that allowed us to recognize some gains there. So, boxing that just directionally, you should think of it as about $150 million after tax. So think of it in the range of $0.45, $0.50 earnings per share in terms of the favorable benefit that we've seen here in 2021. David, you want to clarify on the 2022 commentary. Sure. Morning, Lisa. So, in the second quarter, we fulfilled 9 million of vaccine related scripts. So, out of the 410 million adjusted scripts that we fulfilled in the quarter, about 9 million of those were associated with a vaccine, obviously that's not something to run rate, given we would not expect that level to persist for the balance of the year, but 2%, 3% of the total script volume. Yeah. Sure, David and good morning, Steve. So, just to reiterate David's point, surgeries in particular were a hotspot for us, both in terms of inpatient, outpatient activity in the quarter. We also saw overall outpatient and professional utilization pick up pretty meaningfully in the quarter. Emergency room utilization, radiology remained below baseline in the quarter and kind of within these different categories, there was also some state of service shift, which is a good thing over time. We saw inpatient shift outpatient, particularly for some lower acuity procedures. And we saw some of the emergency room utilization shift, urgent care centers and physician offices, which we view as a good thing from the standpoint of optimizing, like to care. On your point about behavioral health, a metric that I'll share with you just relative to prior to the pandemic. Within our U.S. Commercial book, in 2019 about 8% of our customers were utilizing behavioral health services. And as you know, we have an industry-leading capability in this space. This year, that number is going to be up almost 40%. So, we're going to have nearly 11% of our customers this year, utilizing behavioral health services, which we think is a good thing for the long-term. It's putting a little bit of pressure on the P&L this year, but we believe it's a good thing for the long-term, and our recent acquisition of MDLIVE offers us the opportunity to further synergize that given the demand for virtual behavioral health has grown meaningfully over the course of the pandemic. Sure. Morning, Scott. So, relative to the revenue outlook, obviously we're very pleased with the aggregate growth for the company this year. Of the $4 billion, you should think of the lion's share of that being driven by Evernorth. So think of it as roughly 75-25 with the other segments and in totality Evernorth is on track for a year where both revenue and earnings will grow above well -- above our long-term average annual expectation 4% to 6%. So, we're really pleased with the performance of that business. Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, appreciate the question. If you think about how the second quarter unfolded, I think this is instructive for how we think about the back half of the year and into 2022. So, April, we saw the highest level of COVID costs. As I said earlier, those tracked downward pretty meaningfully in May, in June and the total cost of care when you combine the COVID and non-COVID costs together in the months of May and June is more in line with what we're expecting for the back half of 2021 and as we step into 2022. So, for those reasons, based on the more emergent data, we feel better about the next 18 months as compared to the first four months of the year where we had particularly elevated costs in our book. David, anything you want to add? Good morning, Josh. This is Brian. So, a few different components there, the question. Big picture compared to our expectations, I would encourage you to think about the three books of business, meaning the commercial risk, the individual exchange, and the Medicare Advantage, as all being approximately off by the same amount compared to our expectations in terms of total claim costs. So, I'd start there in terms of, we are not seeing one being really disproportionately impacted relative to our prior expectations. They're all off by, call it, that 200 basis points or so that changed in our MCR guide. The Medicare Advantage business though in 2021 is further weighed down by the risk adjustment revenue headwinds. So, you should view the margins on the Medicare Advantage business as being particularly low relative to what our long-term expectations are. And as we step into 2022, we would expect margin expansion on each of those books of business off of what we're experiencing here in 2021. As it relates to the risk adjuster headwind, that's a component of the $2 per share headwind. We haven't specifically sized that. It's certainly a less than half of that. I would note, we recently received our mid-year settlement from CMS, which was favorable to our expectations, which gives us a further confidence in our ability to fully recover that headwind in 2022. Sure. Good morning. Our longer term targets are consistent, and we remain committed to them. And to remind everybody, it's our attractive revenue growth rate of 6% to 8%, our EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% with the dividend above and beyond that. And our outlook of operating cash flow generation from current year to 2025 of approximately $50 billion. Those numbers are on average over a prolonged period of time. And as we've identified at Investor Day as well, as you look back over the last decade, we have a track record of delivering against those targets and objectives. Good morning, Ricky. It's Brian. I'll take the acuity portion of the question and David to tackle the government component. So, big picture, we're not yet seeing signs of any meaningfully higher acuity amongst our customer base. Part of that due to the focus we've had on preventive care, as you indicated in your question, as well as appropriate behavioral health utilization as we talked about earlier. There are a variety of metrics that we use to track this. And just one really specific one I'll give you, we track within our commercial book of business when we have new cancer diagnosis, how many of them are at a metastatic stage when they're first diagnosed. And so, prior to the pandemic, if you look at the top five cancer types, we saw 38% to 39% of these in a metastatic stage when they presented to us. In 2021, we're in that same range, 38% to 39%. So, that's an indicator that we track one of many that suggests we do not yet have those signs of acuity spikes. And as I said earlier, we're also seeing a site of service shifts in the book of business, which is a mitigant over time to the potential for a QE coming back into the book. David, maybe you want to talk a little bit about the government part of the question. Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, I would encourage you to think of the year in two halves, one half and two half. So, the first half, we ran at 83.6% MCR, and we're modeling the back half to perform at approximately that same level if you use the mid-point of our guidance. So, rather than looking at quarter-by-quarter, because there's quite a bit of variability that's transpired in the different months. But big picture, the first half of the year, we ran a few points above baseline in total when you combine the effect of COVID and non-COVID utilization together. For the back half of the year, we're projecting to run slightly above the baseline in totality and that's comprised of non-COVID utilization running approximately at baseline, plus COVID utilization on top of that. To your question on how does that pattern relative to what we saw in the first half? You should think of the direct COVID-19 related costs as being the highest in the first quarter, lower in the second quarter and we're modeling slightly lower than that for the back half of the year on direct COVID-19 related costs. So, those pieces get you to that overall expectation of slightly above baseline for the back half of the year, and that essentially offsets the seasonality we would typically see in the MCR pattern for our book of business."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Alexis and thank you for everyone for joining us on today's call. So I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about the current environment and the forces that are shaping it, the strength in durable nature of our model that enables us to capitalize on opportunities and continue to grow even in the most disruptive conditions and how the strength and durability is fueling our short and long-term success. Then Brian will share more details about our second quarter results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. And we'll take your questions. So, let's jump in. During the quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $43 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.24 per share, all what we could do to drive balanced capital deployment as we execute on M&A, share repurchase and our quarterly dividend plan. We achieved these results in a fluid and challenging environment. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are confident in our ability to navigate these dynamic conditions. Our portfolio with three growth platforms enables us to create value for our clients and customers and drive sustained business growth. During the quarter, the strength of our Evernorth business was clearly a standout. We are seeing high demand for health services programs, and we continue to invest in broadening our service offerings, as well as our reach. Our sustained success validates our ability to be a trusted partner of choice for customers and clients, as they manage many of the most challenging aspects of healthcare today. We do this by leveraging our portfolio. That includes pharmacy solutions, benefit management solutions, care solutions, and intelligence solutions. Evernorth is helping to improve access to care, keep costs down and deliver better outcomes, as we serve our clients, patients, and customers. And another quarter of Evernorth strong revenue and earnings growth reinforces that our customers and clients value these capabilities. In Cigna Medical, we did see elevated medical cost pressure in the quarter, as costs associated with direct COVID-19 care and the broader ramp-up of utilization levels exceeded our projections. Within this challenging environment, we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our customers have access to the care they need. This includes the elevated mental health services needed during these unprecedented times, as well as continued to work with our customers and patients to help navigate them to optimal sites of care. During the quarter, we achieved customer growth in Cigna Medical, in both our U.S. Commercial and Government business. And we continue to be on track for medical customer growth of at least 350,000 customers in 2021. Brian will share additional perspective on our results and outlook and his comments. Overall, our performance, which is strong through the first half of the year, reflects the resiliency of our business and the balanced profile within our organization. With our focus on driving performance during the remainder of the year, it's imperative that we understand and account for the challenges our customers and clients will face, as well as the continued evolution of the healthcare landscape. At a macro level, the environment is marked by ongoing uncertainty for business, governments, communities around the world. For example, COVID vaccination levels have brought welcome relief to millions, given only about half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, and that percentage is much lower for the world's population. With the spread of the more contagious Delta variant, COVID infections and hospitalizations are on the rise in some regions, bringing renewed attention to travel restrictions and mask mandates. We see the economic recovery, while positive, has let uneven and varied amongst industries, as companies continue to cope with supply chain disruption, emerging inflationary pressure and various issues impacting the workforce. More broadly from a health perspective, federal and state policy makers continue to be actively engaged. And as we've previously discussed, we continue to see three primary forces of change shaping the healthcare landscape today and into the future. Specifically, pharmacological innovation, including specialty pharmaceuticals, gene therapies, evolved oncology medications, vaccines and acceleration in biosimilars. Second, the recognition of the link between mental health and physical health continues to grow, especially accelerated in this COVID environment. And third, the rise of virtual care and other alternative access to care models are rapidly changing. Together, these macro dynamics are profoundly influencing buying behaviors and service innovation in healthcare. Now, with respect to clients, we are seeing a renewed commitment of employer clients to providing healthcare benefits vital to helping them to both attract and retain talent, as well as increased productivity by maintaining a healthy workforce. This includes, for example, adopting alternative side of care programs and access programs. We see an intensified need for affordability across all of our clients, including pharmacy services, as demand surges for high price, breakthrough drug therapies. We see a desire for more concentrated solution based services, as many clients are confronting the convergence of social, physical, and mental health issues in ways they have not experienced before. With respect to the individual customers and patients utilizing our service, we see that they're increasingly valuing their employee-based service models. They're benefiting from support services that help them tend to their emotional wellbeing. And they have growing demand for coordination of care, both in COVID and non-COVID events. Against this backdrop, we are delivering differentiated value for the benefit of our customers and clients with our capabilities that address their emerging and evolving needs. For example, we have had a strong focus on providing virtual services, broadening networks, as well as coordinated clinical programs. In our pharmacy solutions, we've been answering the call for greater affordability, as we continue to see the emergence of new and expensive pharmacological advancements. Evernorth's recent expansion of our industry first comprehensive weight management program illustrates the benefit of a more coordinated approach. Patients can now receive treatment with Wegovy, a promising new therapy for obesity and other weight management medications. And now with MDLIVE fully operational within our Evernorth business, MDLIVE physicians along with other Evernorth clinicians are available to help patients. This program expansion also includes personalized support services from health coaches, peer support groups, and curated digital apps. This weight management effort is the latest addition to our Evernote suite of SafeguardRX programs. As we're impacting 2020, patients enrolled in SafeguardRX to save more than $6 billion in aggregate. In Evernorth care solutions, we've experienced an increase in demand for our behavioral health solutions from customers and clients as well. In the past year and a half, it has brought heightened stress and other personal challenges, and we see many more people reaching out for help and services. Clients now more broadly understand that someone with a chronic condition is more likely to have a mental health or substance abuse related illness and individuals are feeling the additional mental and physical challenges associated with the pandemic. With our market leading behavioral health capabilities, we are driving more value to our Evernorth and Cigna medical clients and customers by providing the tools and services they need to address their mental wellbeing and deliver better, sustained long-term outcomes. Within our Cigna medical platform in U.S. Commercial, we are working closely with our employer clients to provide our integrated suite of solutions, designed to make their workforce healthier and more productive. We know that employees receiving health and wellbeing benefits through their employers are less likely to miss work because of poor health. Our recent study shows a significant impact of the 70 fewer percent days missed over a year. With our integrated approach, we strive to bring the right mix of solutions that reduce the workforce challenges many of our clients are facing and helping to support them to engage and retain their employees. And affordability is remained the primary focus across our entire portfolio, as it is in Cigna medical. Our clients continue to manage through an incredibly dynamic environment for their business and is becoming even more important that they can count on us with greater affordability for the healthcare programs. New and expensive pharmacological advancements are predominant contributor to this challenge. And we have been a leader here putting these treatments in the hands of those who need them at a more affordable price. For example, Remicade is treatment for chronic conditions, such as Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis, while life changing can also impose significant financial burdens. One year of Remicade infusion costs about $30,000 on average, and as much as $70,000, depending on site of care. We recently launched a Cigna pharmacy program that shares prescription drug savings directly with patients who switched from Remicade to one of the approved biosimilars. More than 20% of eligible patients in consultation with their provider have already switched to lower cost preferred alternative medications. This program has an immediate benefit to clients who save at least 10% of the cost of the drug. And we've taken a leadership position here by supporting our patients with a $500 incentive. This is a great example of aligning interest. Over the longer term, we can drive even greater impact as biosimilars become a more prevalent part in the United States as helping us further improve affordability And in Cigna medical, we're actively working toward improving affordability by ensuring that our customers continue to have the access to the care they need and optimize their long-term health. For example, in Arizona, we conducted a highly targeted outreach program to our customers who are high risk due to chronic condition, yet who have not been vaccinated. The initial results are encouraging, and we're seeing positive increase in vaccination rates amongst these targeted individuals. We are now taking the learnings from that pilot into other locations across the United States, with a particular focus on increasing vaccination rates amongst those in most need. This broad range of examples illustrates how our comprehensive and strategic approach to helping our clients and customers address their most pressing health needs help us going forward. And in this dynamic environment, we will continue to expand the services we offer our clients and customers, and therefore, we see many more opportunities to create value for both our clients and customers, and as a result for your shareholders. It is clear that the strength of our medical and pharmacy offerings combined with our strategic agility has enabled us to continue to capture growth, even in the most dynamic environment by delivering differentiated value, by partnering and relentlessly innovating, and by expanding our addressable markets, as we broaden our reach to new geographies and through the introduction of a broader suite of solutions. When you combine this compelling growth potential, along with our significant operating cash flow generated by our service-based capital light model, we have confidence in our ability to meet our long-term targets by achieving differentiated results, which include average annual revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continued to pay an attractive dividends, all while producing cumulative operating cash flow of approximately $50 billion through 2025. Relative to 2021, we remain committed to delivering full year EPS of at least $20.20. Now to briefly summarize. First, we recognize in an environment like this it's so challenging, we know that growth doesn't come easily. It has to be earned each and every day. Second, we have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value, innovating and partnering and smartly expanding our addressable market to fuel sustained long-term growth, even in disrupted environment. And our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities across our three well position growth platforms, and importantly the strategic and capital flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Ralph, good morning. It's David. So, as we think about 2022, clearly, early to give you a detailed guidance, but let me try to walk through the moving parts as we think about 2022. Underlying our outlook will be strong base earnings growth, contributions from ongoing capital deployment, and the recovery of some of the headwind that Brian articulated. There'll be an offset to that. Partially offsetting that will be, the lack of some of the non-run-ratable items we're realizing in our 2021, at least $20.20 EPS outlook. So when you take it all together, we expect 2022 will be another strong year for us. As relates to growth rates, the way I ask you to think about that is, first off, I take at least $20.20. When we adjust that for the non-renewable items, we would expect to grow at the high-end of our 10% to 13% range. Another way of thinking about it, if you take at least $20.20 outlook for 2020, we would expect to grow at least 10% on that. So, a net new item, that was the non-run-ratable items that we'll have in 2022, but an attractive growth rate on either parameter, as we expect to have another strong year for 2022. Matthew, good morning. It's David. From the individual business portfolio, as you know, we've been active in that marketplace since its inception. And after a few years of test and learn and the marketplace stabilizing itself, we sought and began to more systematically expand our growth and that carries into the current year. As relates to the performance in the current year, we have some attractive growth in that business, both underlying fundamental growth, as well as growth contribution from the SEP period. And as it relates to the core of your question on performance, I'd asked you to think about the underlying -- what we're seeing the underlying performance of that book of business is similar to the trends and impact that Brian articulated before. So, we see an uptick in utilization within that book of business, more approximating from a non-COVID standpoint, baseline activity with some additional utilization on the COVID side of the equation. And lastly, our early look at the SEP, special enrollment period, additional lives, those lives are performing similar to other special enrollment period lives we've observed before. So, some of the MLR that we're seeing across our broader portfolio is showing through in the individual business, but not up proportion in either way from the overall behavior of that book. Sure. So, Justin, crosswalk again. First from prior dialogue, as you recall, we would have talked about base earnings, capital deployment, and a recovery of COVID headwind as contributor to our 2022 expectations for ourselves. And that remains, the base performance, the capital deployment and recovery of COVID headwind. As Brian articulated with the COVID headwind, that opportunity is a little greater now for 2022 than it was a quarter of ago from that perspective. The net new item is what Brian walked through, which are the non-reoccurring items. And he gave you approximate order of magnitude. So, again, to repeat to the specific part of your question, we believe today, if you take the at least $20.20 that we will deliver for this year, our growth rate will be at least 10%. We believe if you take the -- at least $20.20 and adjusted for those non-reoccurring items, that we referenced -- that Brian just referenced, the growth rate will approximate 13% or so. So, those are the moving parts relative to our expectations for 2022 on either convention another year for strong, attractive balance performance. No. It includes, Justin, the dollar. So, let's come back -- and previously we would have talked about baseline earnings, capital deployment and the recovery of the headwind. That's what took us to the high-end of the range versus within the range. It currently -- the expectation includes that, but the dollar is somewhat offset by the lack of the non-run-ratable items next year. So, on an all-in basis, we'll grow in the 10% to 13% range, depending on the convention you use, either the $20.20, we will grow at least 10% all-in, or if you look at it, excluding the non-recurring items, that Brian just articulated, about $0.50 we will grow at about 13% all-in. Good morning, Lisa. I'll talk about the growth outlook in the environment and then I'll ask Brian to come back in and talk about the script count, specifically the vaccine. First, we're very pleased with the performance of the Evernorth portfolio. The durable nature of that and an environment of disruption provides some diversification within the portfolio and the service delivery for our clients, health plan clients, corporate clients, government clients remains quite strong. As it relates to the underlying growth rate, our growth in 2021 outstanding for that portfolio and we'll continue to see expected growth for 2022. As we discussed previously, we've known for some time that we have lack of renewal of two health plan clients. So, we knew that, and even with that, we will grow again in 2022 at an attractive rate. We also recognize that given our strong performance, we've been able to maintain appropriate pricing discipline, as we looked at the 2022 environment. So, take it as a whole, an active dynamic year for 2022. We'd expect another strong year of retention, even acknowledging those health plan clients in the mid-90s. And we would expect strong underlying growth of the Evernorth portfolio. Brian, I'll ask you to talk about the vaccine volumes within our scripts for the quarter. Good morning. It's David. Let me provide a little overview and I'll ask Brian to provide some specifics of what we're seeing in terms of some of the specific categories of utilization. You did call out an important category we've unequivocally seen, and I noted in my prepared comments, the mental health or behavioral and substance abuse category is growing. We see more individuals needing and utilizing those services, and appropriately needing and utilizing those services given the environment and our portfolio is really well-positioned to provide that level of support necessary. And we believe that it's not only appropriate required. It will provide some intermediate and long-term benefit to those individuals, obviously to clients, as well as to ourselves on a sustainable basis. Beyond that, we've seen an uptick in -- from prior levels and uptick in both inpatient and outpatient surgeries in the non-COVID category. And as Brian articulated, that categories more broadly approximated baseline levels, and we've assumed that we'll remain at that for the second half of the year. I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color in terms of some of the insights we're seeing in terms of the more detailed utilization patterns. Good morning, Scott. It's David. Let me speak to the headwind and I'll Brian speak to the revenue raise. If I understand your question correctly, you're coming out the portion of the headwind that is non-MCR related. And broadly, we see the impact of the pandemic on employment levels within the commercial population broadly. We had previously called that out as a headwind. We previously called that as a headwind that we believed would return as a favorable tailwind over time. We're taking the posture right now that given the current employment environment, that headwind will more likely persist or set otherwise that's the baseline with which to grow off of. We'll continue to grow no doubt, but that's the baseline to grow off of as we observed the marketplace and the overall employment levels beginning to move forward, but more slowly than anticipated in a variety of sectors. So, view it as disenrollment and/or aggregate employment levels, and the requisite level of changing those employment levels, having and flowing at a slower rate, given the prolonged pandemic. I'll let Brian speak a bit more towards the $4 billion revenue raise. Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. The only item I would add is, as we think about our book of business, approximately two-thirds of our risk business is yet to be priced for 2022. So, as you know, it's not all -- that portfolio of our business is not all one, one or front end loaded from that standpoint. So, we have the opportunity be appropriately responsive as the marketplace changes, but the underlying assumptions that Brian articulated in the medical cost pattern are the most important part of it. Sure. The underlying question comes back to, as Brian broke up -- broke out the portions of it. We essentially are looking at an environment in the second half of the year where the medical cost environment will be slightly above baseline. And the pieces of that are that the non-COVID or the -- call, traditional parts of medical costs approximately baseline in the commercial portfolio and above and beyond that there's some additional load for COVID. So, one would have to believe that either A, the non-COVID costs are going to run above baseline for some reason that they haven't to date when we look at the way we built up the policy for baseline and/or that the additional COVID costs that we're saying are additive to that, will be materially greater, right? So, we acknowledge it's the fluid environment beyond a shadow of a doubt, but we believe that the estimate we've made for the step-up in aggregate for the rest of the year to run slightly above baseline, is an appropriate assessment based upon the pattern we saw in the end of the first quarter and the way in which the second quarter was evolved and developed and as I noted that we have about two-thirds of the risk business yet to be priced for 2022. Lance, good morning. It's David. Appreciate the forward-looking orientation relative to that. To answer your question, we got a ground back into our portfolio. The three platforms we have, which we feel very positively about, the services based platform within Evernorth, the U.S. Medical platform, both Commercial and Government, and then our International platform. We see attractive growth opportunities organically and inorganically in all three as we look to the future. Specifically, you start -- your real thoughtful question in terms of kind of apportionment five years out. We don't have a rigid target five years out that we want X percent in category A or Y percent in category Z. But however, we do see an environment where the services portion of our portfolio will continue to grow at an accelerated rate. We see the right to win, the ability to create value and our strategic position there for the multiple client segments we're able to serve there as being quite attractive, and you should expect this to continue to grow our pharmacy, our care, our benefits and our intelligence capability to be able to bring to bear against that. Secondly, we've continued to call out U.S. Government as an attractive growth segment and that will transpire both organically and inorganically, as opportunities present themselves. And thirdly, we continue to see targeted opportunities in our International portfolio as attractive growth opportunities. On a final note, you articulated examples of home care, otherwise, et cetera, I won't call out any one precise example. But I'll step back and remind you, as we've talked about it, we see what we call alternative sites of care. So, virtual -- longitudinal virtual, polychronic, home care, coordinated home care as attractive additional growth opportunities within our service portfolio, and we continue to extend ourselves and expand ourselves within that space. So, multiple strategic alternatives. Second, strong platforms to build off of. Third, the capital flexibility to be able to grow in multiple attractive markets that you appropriately called out. Thanks. Sure, Ricky. Good morning. The short answer is we see expansion opportunities in both the U.S. Medical side of the equation, as well as in the Evernorth services side. So, more specifically, within the U.S. Medical portfolio organically, we see and are continuing to deliver and pursue additional growth opportunities for both our Medicare Advantage portfolio in existing geographies as well as, as we've discussed before, our continued expansion of those geographies and leveraging our broader product portfolio and platform, as well as in our exchange portfolio as we continue to expand our individual exchange portfolio, which we view as more government business versus not. On the services side, you referenced pharmacy unequivocally, but expanded beyond pharmacy to care and benefit management services, as well as intelligent services. For example, as we look to continue to serve our expanding portfolio of health plan clients, they have diverse portfolios that they serve, commercial obviously, Medicare, Medicaid, exchange and otherwise. That's an important part of our growth chassis as we go forward with dedicated resources. And then ultimately, direct to government contractor relationships as well. So, we see attractive growth opportunities in the government space, both off of the health plan side of the business in the Cigna medical portfolio, as well as in the services side of the business through Evernorth. Sure. Good morning, John. It's David. I'll start relative to your question. And I appreciate the tone, but candidly, I don't feel beaten up. These are dynamic and challenging times. And we're proud of the fact that our portfolio, our diverse portfolio can perform in this environment and importantly, deliver for our clients, our customers and patients, while we deliver our responsibilities from a shareholder perspective. But I appreciate the tone of your question. Now, specifically, as you go back in time, when we brought this portfolio together in terms of the companies, we viewed obviously that we had an opportunity to bring in a leading PBM portfolio of services, but it was broader than that. Secondly, we viewed, as we talk about now, that pharmacological innovation was a big part of the future of healthcare. And the acceleration of innovation is what we're seeing today through a whole variety of things, gene therapy, specialty, medications evolving, biosimilars, et cetera. And hence, if you're going to be helping individuals with their overall healthcare needs, being a leader in pharmacy services is mission-critical. We also saw the opportunity to expand that portfolio through a broader services platform, which we did through Evernorth, and then continue to feed that broader services platform for health plan clients, for corporate clients, for our government clients, et cetera. And as we've noted -- both Brian and I have noted, we're very pleased with the performance within the portfolio and the service we're delivering. And importantly, we continue to invest in that portfolio at an accelerating rate relative to expanding products, services, capabilities, as well as our reach. Now as it relates to the profit model, the primary mechanisms would articulate for you to think about is back to the time you referenced, we acknowledge that the financing models were going to change, and we didn't resist that. We offer choice. We offer choice in terms of how purchasers or clients want to finance their offering. And we've evolved, for example, with a higher percentage of pass-through arrangements for clients in the PBM services from well less than 50% to 50% to well greater than 50% over three cycles. And we've been able to evolve our service based capabilities and our value creation capabilities for the benefit of clients. Secondly, we continue to press for more aligned relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers on the clinical outcomes, not just the consumptions. We know that broadly in the industry is value based programs, but think about them as aligned programs. And then lastly, as the biosimilars start to evolve at a more rapid rate, the positioning of our company to have the clinical depth, the coordination of clinical services, the manufacturer relationships and importantly, the medical physician relationships are mission-critical. And as I use the Remicade example, all those come to bear, because it's a patient-by-patient decision made with a practicing physician relative to the choices and alternatives. So, again, I appreciate your question. We're pleased with the performance, but maybe even more importantly than that underlying your question, we're delighted with the strategic position that the platform gives us right now to continue to drive growth and create value going forward. Dave, good morning. So, again, it's early for the detailed 2022 guidance, but taking the spirit of your question, it ultimately is going to come down to two things. Rate and pace of evolution of the cost environment -- medical cost environment, and rate and pace of our investment portfolio decisions within the organization positioning us for the future. We have a track record of sustained investment in the organization for long-term growth. We have -- as Brian articulated earlier, we have multiple growth and profit levers, and we'll seek to make trade-offs within that and ensure that we seek to deliver an attractive, sustainable result. So, I think those are the two major points I'd ask you to think about. I talked about the growth rate in framework of at least. So, we weren't providing guidance to pencil a number rather how we're thinking about the growth platforms and trajectory. And there's nothing in our underlying business portfolio today. I'll leave you with, there's nothing in our underlying business portfolio today that suggests that the organic underlying growth of our earnings will be demonstrably different unless we determine we're going to make a trade-off in terms of rate and pace of investment within the portfolio or there's an exogenous impact for the industry on the cost side of the equation. We're just trying to frame the at least growth rates off of what we know now mid-year. Thank you, David. Sure. I'll be brief. I want to thank everybody for joining our call. And I just want to reinforce two points. First, I'm appreciative and proud of our more than 70,000 coworkers and their dedication to working to change our customers' lives for the better every day. They continue to rise to the challenges in the moment by helping our clients, our customers, our patients, working with our partners and in our communities to drive positive change. And second, we continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our business and our well-positioned three portfolios, and the strength of our strategic framework, given our results and our outlook. With that, I ask you to have a good day, and we look forward to our future conversations. Thank you."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter the queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ms. Alexis Jones. Please go ahead, Ms. Jones.\nAlexis Jones: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I am Alexis Jones, Lead Principal for Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2021 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2021. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders' net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2021 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $1.1 million or $0.29 per share related to debt extinguishment costs incurred during the period, as well as after tax special item charge of $22 million or $0.06 per for integration and transaction related cost. We also recorded an after tax special benefit of $21 million or $0.06 per share related to charges associated with litigation matters. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues and our discussion of financial results. As previously noted, as a result of the sale of the group disability and life business, in our first quarter earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, corporate and other operations combines the results previously reported as corporate and the segment previously reported as group disability and others. In our security filings, the segment previously reported as group disability and others is now reported as other operation. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2021 outlook, we will do so on a basis that excludes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2021 dividend. And excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today, such as our recently announced planned divestiture of the Texas Medicaid business, which we expect to close in the second half of 2021. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. But today's we meet our environment remains highly dynamic with COVID-19 continues to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing landscape has only reinforced the tremendous responsibility we have to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve. This remains the primary focus that drives our 70,000 co-workers each and every day. And it's the reason we work to continue to deliver for our customers, clients, patients, partners and our communities, all while delivering strong financial results for you, our shareholders. During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $41 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.73 per share. We also deployed significant capital to our investors through share repurchase and the payment of a meaningful quarterly dividend, reinforcing the strength of our capital like framework. Building on our conversation from several weeks ago at our Investor Day, today, I'm going to talk more about how we are continuing to navigate through the current environment to balance and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, our ability to consistently deliver strong results by executing on a growth framework and the competence we have in achieving our increased outlook by delivering differentiated and sustained growth for the long term. Then Brian will share more details about our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. And after that, we'll take your questions. Since we last met at our Investor Day in March, the macro landscape remains fluid. In the U.S. proposed legislation as well as regulation and executive actions to expand extend and further support both public and private programs. Globally, social and political tensions remain high as COVID-19 with its multiple variants continue to take a toll on a number of countries, such as India, where cases have again dramatically spiked. All these forces are shaping healthcare and influencing the political and economic landscape around the world. At Cigna, we are navigating through this environment by continue to innovate for and support our stakeholders with COVID-19 services, while also executing other strategies to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple For U.S. commercial customers, we're ensuring they get the preventative care they need, including mammographies, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screenings, and childhood immunizations, which today are consistent with pre pandemic levels, reflecting the continued strength of our clinical programs, and proven engagement capabilities. Within Evernorth, for those customers served by Express Scripts home delivery, we've delivered further improvements in medication adherence for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. At the same time, we're also supporting the mental wellbeing of our customers. We're doing this through our own best-in-class capabilities where for example, we engage with oncology patients with comorbidities by spending an average of $2,000 on their behavioral health care, we can save an average of $20,000 in avoidable costs. And we can innovate and leverage our strategic partnerships, including, for example, with Ginger, through Cigna ventures, which provides industry leading on demand 24x7 behavioral health coach and further extending our behavioral health access for the benefit of our customers. We're also leveraging data in actionable intelligence to understand the most common long term complications of COVID-19 infection, then building predictive models to determine who is at greatest risk of becoming a COVID law hauler, so we can quickly provide targeted case management and behavioral health services, as well as other resources to help our customers regain their health. For our clients, we're serving as a trusted partner. by supplying additional physical and behavioral health assistance to aid in the recovery for employees who are infected by COVID-19. We're helping employers build their own communities of immunity by assisting them in launching vaccination clinics. And we're collecting our data and analytics help employers determine when and how it is safe for employees to return to work. For provider partners, we're working to guide people to the most effective sites of care and further closing gaps in care with our clinical teams and our virtual capabilities. For coworkers, we're supporting them in this highly disruptive environment by for example, providing $200 incentive for co-workers who choose to become vaccinated for COVID-19 and continuing to offer expanded leave capabilities with our emergency time off program to provide flexibility necessitated by the current conditions. And finally, for our communities, we're taking steps to address social determinants of health. For example, we all know the alarming statistics on the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on communities of color. As part of our safe initiative, we brought additional underground resources to target communities by launching COVID-19 awareness campaigns, distributing PP&E kits, dispatching our health improvement mobile resources to help you administer free flu shots and provide healthy meal, as well as other support. Similarly, we're leaning in to fight breast cancer with disparities, for example, well, amongst black women remain startling, tough to address this disparity gap, we again went directly into communities. Starting in Tennessee, for example, where we collaborated with local partners to offer mobile mammography vans at churches, and at other local neighborhood locations. At Cigna, balancing the needs of our stakeholders is deeply rooted in our corporate purpose. We constantly challenge ourselves by asking the basic question, what more could we do to help us stay focused on delivering each and every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients, patients and our partners. Against this backdrop, the strength of our foundation propels us forward and guides our growth. As we share with you at our Investor Day, through our three growth platforms Evernorth, U.S. Medical and International Markets, we are well positioned to leverage the three trends we see shaping healthcare into the future, specifically, pharmacological innovations, the rising demand for coordinated mental and physical health services, and the changing preferences as it relates to access to care models. And through a proven framework, we're able to drive attractive sustained growth by delivering differentiated value within our portfolio of integrated, coordinated endpoint solutions, continuing to work to partner and innovate, and working to expand our addressable markets. As a result, we're off to a strong start in 2021, with strong fundamental execution, and the strategic and capital flexibility to further our momentum into the future. During the first quarter Evernorth continue to build on its differentiated and steady performance it had delivered throughout the pandemic, by evolving the healthcare experience for our customers and clients through continuous innovation, and by building investing, and strengthening our strategic partnerships. For example, in January, we further expanded our partnership with Prime Therapeutics by leveraging our home delivery and Accredo Specialty Pharmacy to drive greater value and delivering our promise to make healthcare more affordable. We're also advancing our strategic capabilities with our MDLIVE acquisition which closed last month. This acquisition will expand Evernorth's cares ability to further broaden access, lower cost of care, and strategically positioned us to grow in the rapidly changing access to care environment. At the same time, Evernorth pharmacy is also driving affordability improvement. One example is our patient assurance program, which caps the cost of prescriptions for patients with diabetes. During the quarter the number of patients in this program increased by 64%. And the value of patients delivered from this program is on track to more than double what we achieved last year. Turning to our U.S. medical platform, we see bright spots and growth in our U.S. commercial portfolio. For example, we continue to take share in the Select segment, which includes employers with 51 to 500 employees. As clients continue to value our integrated, align, self funded, medical, pharmacy behavioral and stop-loss programs. And more broadly, we're driving value by bringing differentiated offerings to market fueled by innovations and advancements we are accessing from our Evernorth capabilities, particularly in areas of pharmacy services, and behavioral health. Through our willingness to strategically partner with innovative companies like Oscar, we're also well positioned to take advantage of market growth opportunities in the small employer market, a market we view is currently being underserved. As a result, we expect to see an uptick in growth in our U.S. Commercial platform during the residual part of this year. Additionally, one important impact of the pandemic is that businesses have expanded access to support services for the employees, backing is a trusted source of information and providing an extended range of benefits to support whole person health. As more and more employers recognize the critical link between mental and physical health. In the wake of COVID-19, more employers are also recognizing the connection between healthy workers, higher productivity and a growing economy. In fact, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that in the U.S., we benefited by $1.5 trillion of value by having employers play a major role in health care. This reinforces the critical role, our U.S. healthcare business plays as an important partner to employers in providing access to quality, affordable care for the benefit of their employees. Turning to U.S. government business, we're driving strong year-over-year customer growth by continuing to expand our addressable markets. The number of Medicare Advantage customers increased by 11% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategy, as well as our sustained strong star performance. And the number of customers in our individual and family plan business grew by 17% year over year, driven by our geographic expansion, and the introduction of new plans that provide expanded coverage for maintenance drugs, to further improve affordability for customers with certain chronic conditions. In our International Markets business, we're focused on actively supporting our co workers, customers and partners around the world who continue to be impacted by COVID-19. For example, in India, our foundation is providing financial support through UNICEF to meet the critical needs on the ground, including additional rapid testing capabilities and expanded access to vaccines. And we're providing matching gifts from the Cigna foundation to our co-workers who donate to charities in India. Staying true to our mission is not only the right thing to do, it reinforced to our clients, our customers and our patients, our commitment to make a difference in the moments that matter most. Our purpose driven orientation, together with our strategic flexibility created by our service based model and recapitalize framework that generates significant cash flow from operations, as well as our track record of strong financial performance, where we delivered a 15% adjusted EPS compounded growth rate over the last decade, all give us confidence we will continue to sustainably grow in both the short term and the long term in this dynamic environment. And now taking into account the strength of our first quarter results, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be at least $20.20 in 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long term targets of average annual adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continue to play an attractive dividend while delivering cumulative operating cash flow growth of $50 billion through 2025. Now to briefly summarize, we delivered strong first quarter results by executing our growth framework, while harnessing our capital strength to deploy meaningful capital for the benefit of our shareholders, reinvesting in our business, and leveraging our strategic flexibility to continue to innovate and adapt, all of which sets us up for sustained long term success. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow as we focus our efforts to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple each and every day. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss their updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue of $41 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.73. Results in the first quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. The favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non-recurring operating expenses. Our results reflect our ability to deliver a dynamic, rapidly evolving environment, including navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding our segments, our first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2021, adjusted revenues grew to $30.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.2 billion. Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by effective execution of supply chain initiatives, continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy, and organic growth of our services with deepening partnerships, all while continuing to invest for ongoing growth. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $393 million during the quarter, a 9% increase over first quarter 2020. Overall, Evernorth continued as positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to U.S. medical, we entered the year expecting to see the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment cost pressure in the U.S. medical segment in the first half of 2021, particularly in the first quarter. As we progress throughout the first quarter we saw COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations declined more rapidly than we originally anticipated. Additionally, as COVID-19 cases decelerated, we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, throughout all of this, we continue to see key components of preventive care, utilize the pre pandemic levels for U.S. commercial customer's taken as a whole and excluding prior year medical cost developments, our first quarter medical care ratio was in line with our expectations. With that as context, I'll now comment specifically on first quarter financial results for the U.S. medical segments. First quarter adjusted revenues were $10.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $987 million. Our first quarter U.S. medical earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by favorable net investment income, and prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Excluding these onetime factors, our us medical earnings were in line with our expectations. Turning to membership we ended the quarter with 16.7 million total medical customers, an increase of 30,000 customers sequentially. As expected, U.S. commercial customer volume declined sequentially due to disenrollment throughout the first quarter, partially offset by new sales in the Select segment. And our U.S. government businesses performed well throughout the annual open enrollment periods. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. medical segment reflect strong fundamentals. In our international markets business, first quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $262 million, reflecting business growth, favorable net investment income and foreign currency movements offset by higher claims costs during the period. I would also note that a refinements to the accounting for acquisition costs lead to a one-time favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2020 that did not recur in the current period. Corporate and other operations reflect a first quarter adjusted loss of $330 million. These results reflect lower interest expense due to lower levels of outstanding debt offset by the absence of contributions from the group disability and life business, which was invested on December 31, 2020. Overall, as a result of strong execution and a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results across our businesses. Now looking forward to our outlook for full year 2021. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our growth platforms. And we expect to make continued meaningful investments in our businesses that are responsive to the forces changing healthcare, positioning us for continued long term growth. Taken as a whole, we are raising our prior guidance for full year 2021. We now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $166 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability and life business. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Within our outlook, we continue to expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share, primarily within our U.S. medical business. And we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.65 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of at least 5%. This outlook reflects ongoing investments in our Evernorth portfolio, including investments in care solutions and MDLIVE as we continue to see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market. For U.S. medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses, as we expect to drive organic customer growth and deepening of customer relationships. We expect direct COVID-19 related testing and treatment to decline throughout the balance of the year, and also anticipate more normalized non-COVID utilization. And with the strength of the U.S. medical first quarter results, we will further accelerate strategic investments to support future growth, thus leaving our full year earnings outlook for U.S. medical unchanged. Regarding total medical customers, we now expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. This includes organic growth throughout the remainder of the year in our commercial business, led by the middle market and select segments partially offset by disenrollment in national accounts. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%. And we expect continue growth in our individual business. Turning to medical costs, we continue to expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs, and more normalized non-COVID utilization, and the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021. All while we continue to deliver strong clinical quality and overall affordability for our clients and customers. We also expect continued growth and strong margins in international markets. All-in for full year 2021, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $7 billion, or at least $20.20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth, while navigating the impacts associated with COVID-19. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation. For 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. During the quarter, we met our previously stated share repurchase expectations and year to date as of May 6, 2021, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $3.2 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 346 million to 348 million shares. We ended first quarter 2021 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.9%, in line with our long term target of approximately 40%. We had $2.5 billion of cash available to parents at the end of the quarter. And on April 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on June 23 to shareholders of record as of June 8. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. These favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical costs development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Our strong results give us confidence in our increased outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and co workers. As such, we now expect 2021 full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.20 per share, and have continued confidence in our long term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Finally, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to allow sufficient time for questions from those remaining in the queue. One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from Mr. Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead with your question, sir.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe it's just done on the PBM. The segment grew pre-tax income 13% year-over-year. And I think this is the quarter where you're actually lapping some benefits from COVID pull forward last year. So just wanted to see if there's anything you'd call out further within the PBM in the quarter? And then relatedly, if I look at the guidance from this point forward, it does seem to imply for the remaining three quarters kind of mid single digit growth, income growth within the PBM. So curious if you have line-of-sight into what might cause a deceleration from the strong performance in the first quarter? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Bob. It's Brian. So thanks for the question. And yes, we're really pleased with the strong start to the year in Evernorth, which as I mentioned in my comments, gives us the confidence to increase the full year guidance to at least $5.65 billion of operating income. Quarter-to-quarter there will be some level of variability in the segments. I would encourage you not to overreact to the singular quarter that we had here. But certainly pleased with 13% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth. I would remind you that our Prime Therapeutics partnership launched April 1, 2020. So the base period last year and the first quarter did not have contributions from Prime Therapeutics. So that was a bit of a benefit to this quarter that will not recur to the same degree for the balance of the year. So to your point on the operating income growth appearing to slow to some degree later in the year. That's one contribution that you should -- that they should keep in mind. Additionally, we continue to invest aggressively in Evernorth to expand and diversify the suite of solutions in that portfolio. So, as you think about Care Solutions, Benefits Management insights, we will make a continued organic and on a targeted basis in organic investments to continue to expand that portfolio, which will increase SG&A in to some degree temper the income growth for the balance of the year. David, anything you want to add to that?\nDavid Cordani: Just highlighting the fact that in support of that, for example, our Evernorth Benefits business performed very strongly in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, that was a partial contributor to the year-over-year increase as Brian articulated. And we remain committed to continue to invest in the businesses, all while meeting now our increased earnings outlook for the full year.\nRobert Jones: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Jones. Our next question comes from Mr. Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. The SG&A on the U.S. Medical side that was higher. And I think you mentioned non-recurring operating expenses. So just hoping to give a little bit more details on what that exactly was and if you're willing to quantify the Evernorth? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Ralph. It's Brian. So maybe let me unpack the U.S. Medical non-recurring items a little bit. This might speak to the core of your question a little bit. As I mentioned in my comments, overall, our U.S. medical earnings in the quarter were above our expectations. But when you remove the effect of the three non-recurring items, we were in line with our expectations. So there's a three non recurring items that I cited, we had some favorability in the quarter and net investment income. We had some favorability in the quarter and prior year medical cost development, and that was offset by non-recurring operating expenses. And so, to the core of your question, the non-recurring operating expenses, you can think of as litigation-oriented matters associated with operations from several years ago. So these are not related to current time periods. These are unrelated to Anthem. These are matters from several years ago, but they're related to operations. And as a result of that, we chose to book them through SG&A as opposed to considering them as a special item below the line or anything like that. They were appropriate in our eyes to book through SG&A above the line. And in order of magnitude, you can think of that as approximately offsetting the favorable benefit that we had from net investment income in the quarter within U.S. medical. But those are truly non-recurring items since they're related to periods from several years ago and those matters should now be closed.\nRalph Giacobbe: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Giacobbe. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I want to squeeze in a couple quick questions. First, in terms of medical cost expectations through the year, you give us an update on COVID, but wanted to get an idea of what you're thinking into the back half of the year in terms of -- in terms of utilization pick up, post the vaccine. What you built in versus kind of typical trend. And then, you mentioned, you divested -- plan to divest -- to sell that Texas Medicaid business. Just wanted to see if there's any background there in terms of what drove you to kind of the divest that? And then, kind of updated thoughts on your kind of Medicaid strategy going forward to be helpful? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Hey, Justin. Good morning. It's David. Let me just frame the medical costs for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction more broadly. First, from a medical cost standpoint, big picture. We're pleased with the start to the year. Big picture broadly speaking, we're pleased to start to the year. And I just want to underscore a couple of components. One, our organization works tirelessly to try to drive elevated utilization of certain services like preventative care services. And importantly, we saw in the first quarter, the use of preventative care services like mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screenings to be at an approximate level of pre-pandemic levels. That's a tremendous result of offsetting what might have been a dampening to utilization. The national data we see more broadly is that utilization of those preventative care services is at a more dampened rate, but ours is an elevated or more consistent rate from that standpoint, which is quite important. Secondly, I would just remind you that and I'll tie this back in our Medicaid comment a little later, is that we have a de minimis amount of Medicaid within our portfolio. And our national data suggests to our services businesses, through Evernorth services business that in the first quarter Medicaid medical costs were a bit more dampened year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. That's not an effect on our portfolio. But we can see that in the services that we're providing. And I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color forward looking on the year, then I'll come back and address Medicaid.\nBrian Evanko: Yes. Good morning, Justin. So, just a few other comments on the quarter and the balance of the year. Overall, as I mentioned in my comments, the U.S. Medical MCR was in line with our expectations for the first quarter, when you exclude the benefit of PYD [ph], or prior development. When you include the benefit of prior year development, we're actually a little bit favorable on the first quarter. And that was at an elevated level, as we expected, when we stepped into the year. For the balance of the year, we expect that deceleration in COVID-19, testing and treatment costs, we expect an uptick in non-COVID related utilization in quarters two through four, with those factors roughly offsetting one another. And so, when we constructed our full year outlook of an 81% to 82% medical care ratio, we stress tested a variety of scenarios about -- associate with those two levers and are quite confident in our ability to achieve the full year 81% to 82% medical care ratio for U.S. medical. David, maybe on the Texas Medicaid and our broader Medicaid strategy, over to you sure.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Justin. We chose to divest of that single site Medicaid operation we had. So number one, it was -- we have one of one. So it was one off within our portfolio that has a de minimis impact on our P&L at the enterprise level. So putting that aside, we determined it was best for that business to be served by an expert or specialist. And we're pleased to effectuate and seek to close a successful transition to Molina. We think that's beneficial to the customers being served than our co-workers in that business. Looking forward, we continue to see Medicaid and government services first and foremost as an attractive growth opportunity within our Evernorth service portfolio. Whether it's Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits, Evernorth Intelligence, the opportunity to bring expanded services largely through health plans today in support of Medicaid will be a growing organic part of our portfolio. Over time, we see opportunities that will manifest themselves state-by-state on state specific service relationships against Evernorth. And then finally, as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, within our M&A priority, we continue to have an expansion of our U.S. government programs as an M&A priority. So we'll be opportunistic from that standpoint, if we see the ability to further strengthen any of our capabilities looking forward. But that divestiture was again, it was a one-off de minimis impact and we deemed that was best in the hands of a specialist. Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, David, I would ask a little bit more color about the MDLIVE acquisition? And how you guys are thinking about care delivery partnerships? And I'd love a little bit of commentary maybe on how the digital formulary is progressing. And if you could maybe talk about if that's going to have meaningful revenue contribution that's in the Evernorth segment?\nDavid Cordani: So thanks for the question, George. So specific to MDLIVE, first important to reference the fact that we had a multiyear relationship with MVLIVE both partnering to continue the services, but also through our very successful multiyear Cigna Ventures organization. So, we start from a learned shared experience and even deeper collaboration during the COVID environment. Specific to the asset and the direction, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we see rapid expansion of what we call alternative side of care to be one of the three major trends as we look forward over the next five to 10 years. This is an important part of those building blocks, and it's an important part of our Evernorth care portfolio of capabilities. We see it as much greater than telemed or even basic virtual care triaging. We see the ability to obviously expand virtual care, primary care, behavioral care. We see the ability to expand that further in terms of longitudinal chronic care programs, polychronic, and ultimately complex care programs and capabilities. So it provides us an accelerant to our strategic direction with a known partner that will now be part of the overall Cigna portfolio. And we're excited. Because net-net, it drives, improved service, improved access, improved affordability with strong clinical outcomes for the benefit of our consumers. So truly an aggregate win-win in the portfolio. Specific to the digital formulary that innovation continues to be somewhat unique in the marketplace. Our clients really appreciate the approach relative to the digital formulary, helping to essentially curate and apply externally validated expertise to the vast array of digital alternatives that exists in the ecosystem to help, to provide employers more informed decisions for those that may have the greatest outcome and impact for the benefit of the customer. So, I view that as a part of our consultative approach in terms of providing support, and a part of our approach to -- in this case partner and curate additional services on a go forward basis. Taking in the whole, we see, again, our Evernorth care capabilities as an exciting part of the broader economic growth capabilities, and we see the ability to do that in a complimentary nature with our proven value based care relationships within our Cigna, our portfolio as well. Hope that helps, George.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our next question comes from a Mr. A.J. Rice. Your line is open sir, with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I'm going to just ask about the selling season, both for Medical and for Evernorth on the PBM side. I know last year, there was some discussion about potentially people being delayed, different people had different views as to how much of that activity actually happened. I wondered what you've seen in terms of RFP activity on both sides of the business, anything to discuss in terms of new and innovative ways that Cigna is going to market in those two sides of your business? And any discussion about early wins, losses?\nDavid Cordani: A.J. Good morning, it's David. So relative to the selling season, looking to 2022, your question goes at the commercial side, as well as the services side of the business. First, on the commercial side of the portfolio, at this stage of the year, we're typically looking at the national accounts environment. And remind you that we define national accounts in -- for our U.S. commercial portfolio a little bit more narrowly than some in the market. So it's commercial employers, 5,000 or more employees who are multi-state in nature. As we look to 2022, right now, we see an environment where the RFP volume, so the opportunity to pursue new business is up somewhat. I think order of magnitude 10%. And we see the portion of our book of business that's out to bid is being up marginally less than that 10% number. So that's a little bit of framing. We have some early traction, some early wins, that exists in our portfolio. And as we sit here at this stage of the environment, we're optimistic that we'll have a very good commercial outlook in aggregate for our portfolio as we look to 2020. I'll bridge with a trend comment and then I'll come to the Evernorthportfolio. Clearly affordability remains a top decision criteria for commercial employers,. There's no doubt about that. We spent ample time on that at our Investor Day, and it remains a top strategic imperative. Further, beyond that is the flexibility necessary, and then the innovation required to truly integrate or coordinate mental and physical health programs, and then expand and coordinate access to care in a less fragmented way through alternative site of care framework, et cetera. So we see the trends being well lined up to our direction. As relates to within Evernorth and specific to your question within pharmacy services. As you recall, we have now multiple years of very attractive growth under our belts as a combined organization. And we're pleased with that. As we look to 2022, we have an environment where to date our employer renewal process is manifesting itself quite strongly. And our health plan renewal process is manifesting itself rather strongly beyond the two known losses that we previously discussed, relative to the health plan business. Taken as a whole, we'd expect the retention in that business as we sit here right now to be a bit less than our recent couple of years, which have been historic highs in the upper 90s, we'll expect it to be more in the mid 90s as a consistent rate. And then taken as a whole, we will expect to see both revenue and earnings growth in our Evernorth portfolio in 2022. So, both pointing in a positive direction would be the summary I would leave you with.\nA.J. Rice: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks. The way that you were framing the drop-off and COVID utilization, and then I guess the earlier return in volumes. To me implied that the COVID impact might actually end up being less than what you were forecasting. But you obviously reaffirm that number. So just any thoughts about kind of the puts and takes of COVID is dropping faster than you thought? Can then, do you still feel like about half of that coming back next year is the right way to think about that? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, a few thoughts on your question. I appreciate the framing of it. Broadly in the quarter, as I said earlier, the MCR for U.S. Medical was in line with our expectations when you include the federal benefit from prior year development. Now the components within were a little bit different than we anticipated. So to your point, the COVID-19 testing and treatment burden on our book was a little bit lower than we anticipated for the quarter. However, non COVID utilization was a little bit higher than we anticipated coming into the quarter. So net effect of those two factors led to the U.S. Medical MCR, being back in line with where we expected it to be. As we trend out the balance of the year, we continue to expect that phenomenon to perceive, meaning, deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, and a little bit of an uptick in non COVID related utilization. So to your point, we expect about 50% of the EPS headwind associated with COVID-19, a $1.25 to continue to show up in the U.S. Medical MCR. And bridging over into 2022, we continue to anticipate about half of that $1.25, or a little bit over half of that to return in the form of earnings in our 2022 enterprise portfolio. And as such, we would expect that our long term annual growth rate in EPS of 10% to 13%. We would expect to achieve results that's at or above the high end of that range relative to our updated guidance of at least $20.20 per share.\nKevin Fischbeck: Helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Miss. Lisa Gil with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gil: Thanks very much for taking my question. I just wanted to go back, David, and ask a question around the comments that you made around MDLIVE. Specifically, you talked about expanding primary care and longitudinal care. You talked earlier about your relationship with Ginger around mental health. So, my question here is really twofold. First, where do you see the opportunities with MDLIVE around lowering overall medical costs for Cigna? Second, do you believe that you need to buy or continue to build out something around behavioral health? And then thirdly, can you just give us an idea of how many Cigna Lives actually use MDLIVE today?\nDavid Cordani: Lisa, thanks. Appreciate the ongoing interest in the space for sure. So number one, bigger picture framing, I appreciate that you brought MDLIVE, Ginger together, for example. We don't -- we do not believe that this is a one-and-done type activity. So, we don't believe that a corporation secures itself a virtual care asset. And then this were for the alternative delivery space. This is a fluid environment. It's a dynamic environment, and it\u2019s an environment that has massive promise relative to bringing the expanded access, coordination of services, and improve overall value coming back to the affordability. Our organic capabilities are strong, the MDLIVE asset advances that massively. But as Brian noted in his prior comments, as well, we continue to invest in the space. So I want you to view that we view it as a dynamic and fluid space and we very much like our positioning. Two is, just like in the -- what we'll call it the traditional care delivery space, the coordination of physical and mental health is mission critical. Just because it's in a virtual care environment, doesn't mean that the coordination of the leverage opportunity there is not -- is critical. And in fact, the virtual capabilities allow us to take fragmentation out of the system more aggressively and more comprehensively. To your affordability comment, unequivocally, we see an ability to further improve affordability through alternative site of care and through our virtual capabilities. You may recall from Investor Day, we identified alternative site of care or site of care leverage as a meaningful opportunity to further deflect or improve overall affordability. And an example maybe, we see already in a virtual care delivery, less use of unnecessary or redundant diagnostic services. That's a tangible illustration of a improvement in affordability. Conversely, we see opportunities to even further close gaps in care or increase utilization of the right services, like maintenance medications, through the dynamic, more intimate, ongoing interaction with customers or patients from that standpoint. So my points are threefold. One, continuation of investment here and innovation off of a very strong base. Two, a continued need to use the capabilities to close fragmentation within the system or get more complimentary leverage, most notably between the medical health and the mental health capabilities. And three, unequivocally a contributor to further improved affordability.\nLisa Gil: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Miss. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Here with Eric Percher as well. Can you speak to the progress in both the individual exchanges? I think I heard 17% number as well as the small group markets. I'm specifically interested in membership growth. And when you think you have enough information around medical costs and sort of utilization of new product, et cetera to better understand sort of profit trajectories here, this year?\nDavid Cordani: Hey, Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me just start and frame the growth trajectory. And then ask Brian to will provide a little bit of additional color, relative to our insights on the performance. First, we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the sustained performance starting with the individual exchanges. Just as you recall, we entered the exchanges in the first year, and we've sustained engagement in the exchanges since its inception. We've innovated within the exchanges. We've delivered a proven model. And now we're in an expansion mode relative to additional geographies, in large part with our collaborative accountable care and aligned value based relationships from the healthcare delivery system. And we're pleased with the results, both the base results in individual exchange, as well as thus far our early look at the additional enrollment we're seeing because the expanded SEP. I'll ask Brian just give you a little color relative to that dimension. As relates to the small employer marketplace. As you know, we, Cigna historically have not played in the small employer marketplace. What we've focused above 51 lives or above 100 lives depending on the regulation more broadly. We have continued to view it as an underserved market, a market that has had more traditional or rigidly designed programs, less innovation and less flexibility, and less leverage of more modern specialty and clinical services. And our determination was, it was best to pursue that market in partnership, leveraging our partnership DNA. And we've entered that market successfully with our partnership with Oscar. We're really early in that journey, some positive indicators for sure, we're really in the journey. Our early indicators are positive, though, that has us accelerating our geographies. And in collaboration with Oscar, and again back to in partnership with our healthcare delivery partners. So, Brian, maybe just a little color in terms of what we view the SEP process looking like and the economics within the individual exchange?\nBrian Evanko: Sure. Good morning, Josh. Our individual membership year to-date is a little bit above our expectations for a couple of different reasons. One is, I'm sure you know, we stepped into 80 new counties in 2021. And the enrollment, the annual enrollment period there was a little bit above our expectations. Additionally, the expanded special enrollment period window that President Biden introduced has generated some new lives in our portfolio as of the end of the first quarter. We have no reason to believe at this juncture that those customers will perform meaningfully differently than the balance of our individual exchange portfolio to your point on when will we know for sure. It will take several months, as we understand the risk adjuster profile, and the persistency of those new lives, et cetera. But I also would remind you the individual exchange membership only represents about 5%, 6% of our total U.S. Medical portfolio. So it won't be a significant needle mover relative to the MCR for your outlook for U.S. Medical.\nJoshua Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Question just first, if it be helpful, maybe you could break down just on the $1 billion raise revenue guidance. How you would sort of break that down between each of the three segments? And then also, interested just in sort of what you're seeing in aggregate right now around the debate around inflation, and not just think about medical inflation, but obviously, Cigna has a lot of insights into just general inflation dynamics across all of your businesses. So, interested in terms of what you're seeing in the first quarter as relates to whether you're actually seeing inflation rising and, and how you're thinking about the outlook for that over the course of the year? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Scott, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Brian, just to give you a little color on our really strong sustained revenue performance. And then I'll come back and seek to address your inflation question.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Scott. So really pleased with the Q1 performance on revenue as well as the full year increase in our guidance of at least $166 billion. You should think of the majority of that increase coming from the Evernorth segment. But importantly, we're also seeing strength within U.S. Medical. So we think of most of it from Evernorth and a bit of an uptick in U.S. Medical as well. David, back to you on the inflation question.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Scott, on the inflation question, I'm going to come out with two ways. First, through the core visibility of our business and then more broadly for those we serve. Thus far within our business, we do not see a large trajectory change relative to what I would call cost of goods sold inflationary pressure. There's always some, makes no doubt about it. There is always some. But through ongoing innovation, ongoing productivity, ongoing value based collaboration, broadly speaking, I would not call a large sea [ph] change from that standpoint. Beyond that, in the broader economy, whether we look at it through a U.S. lens or pockets of markets outside the United States, there's clearly a warming up. There's an indisputable warming up of the economy. And there's a clearly warming up of inflationary indicators, but none of which have triggered across a threshold to suggest any one industry safe for some unique outliers, any kind of orange going to red threshold levels of inflation, but the robustness of the economy and some of the underlying cost drivers in some sub sectors are slowly beginning to elevate. And I think have a lot of industry leaders watching to ensure that any movement in curves, any movement in cost curves could be anticipated, either eradicated through pricing actions, like CPG companies that are being intensively discussed, cost pressures in some sub sectors of the technology ecosystem where the chip industry is out of pattern relative to supply and demand from that standpoint. But broadly speaking, I would say again, nothing affecting our space over the immediate term horizon from an inflationary standpoint.\nScott Fidel: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you. Let me ask the question about Medicare Advantage in the outlook. How do you think it's going to work with rates? I know that I'm asking about 2023. And I know that's a light year away. But my question really is Medicare Advantage benefited from the lower expenses in 2020? I'm wondering how you think that's going to roll through the rate calculation. Because right now, CMS has 2020, down 8% per capita, and then increasing about 11% in this year and the next year. And so I guess my question is, do you think that kind of trajectory is likely for medical costs? And then, if you can comment on how you think that might work into the 2023 rate?\nDavid Cordani: Matthew, a pretty complex, Rubik's cube would put on the table. Thoughtful, but nonetheless complex. I think a you -- as I think your question and [Indiscernible] question. If we look at the 2020 to 2021 environment, clearly, the posture of CMS recognize the COVID dislocation, recognize that dislocation, for examples, implication on risk adjusters sought to in their own methodology, seek to provide some offset to that relative to their rate setting environment, as well as their guidance relative to delivery system reimbursement, and set themselves up for what I would say is a pretty fluid and complex environment over the ensuing couple of years ahead. So, I would expect the next couple years cycle to be a little non-traditional from that standpoint, given the need to adjust the various moving parts that result in a net rate setting environment. History would tell us that the result of all of the above, plus or minus a point or two largely gets the program to a balanced sustainable outcome. And looking forward, I would expect that because the Medicare Advantage program continues to deliver outstanding value, as you know, for seniors, hence the tremendous support from a senior standpoint, as well as overall clinical quality and affordability of which through the bonus programs and the reimbursement programs the federal government's budget actually benefits from. So I would expect it to be able to be balanced for that, but a little bit more lumpy than it has been in the past. And I think this year's risk adjuster through ups will be really mission critical in terms of how CMS sees the industry, recapturing a little bit more of the information that they deem necessary to get the risk adjusters and then they'll factor that into the forward looking 2023 rate environment. Stay tuned for more.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay, David. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Miss. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. One for David. You talked about sort of the return of some of the diagnostic procedures did now are in line with for pandemic. Are you clearly, acuity is a big uncertainty for the rest of the year? But now that you starting to have this data as individuals are starting to come back for preventive care testing. Are you seeing any changes in acuity? That's one. And then my second question goes back to M&A and investments, clearly, a very big focus and part of your growth strategy. So what metric do you use when you evaluate a buy versus a partner or a build decision?\nDavid Cordani: Ricky, good morning, It's David. We're going to take both of your questions. And your first question. To be very clear, we have seen consistent, strong utilization of preventative care services. And notably, what I called out is, for example, in the first quarter of 2021, broadly speaking, preventative care services inclusive of mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screening, plus or minus in the commercial portfolio business, approximate pre pandemic levels. We think that's a very good thing. I mean, underscore. It's a very good thing and something that our team has worked tirelessly to try to effectuate elevating those levels. We see that performance against a national dataset that suggests the utilization of those preventative care services are down versus pre pandemic levels 10% to 15% for our book of business they are not. As a predictor then to the future, we see that as a mitigant for an elevation of acuity, all other things remaining equal, because you're consistently identifying an earlier stage through the preventative diagnostics or the preventative services. Equally as important, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are, for example, within our Evernorth portfolio and within our Evernorth Pharmacy portfolio, for those customers being served by our mail order, we've actually seen get even further elevation of medication adherence. That's really important for the chronic population to avoid spikes in acuity moving forward, whether it's for a diabetic, COPD, asthmatic or other patients from that standpoint. So, broadly speaking, we're working tirelessly to get the right clinical quality and services to be consumed and supported with the clinical resources we have to avert spikes and acuity going forward. And therefore we don't expect a large spike in acuity on a look forward basis, given the strong preventative or medication compliance. As it relates to your M&A question, there's not a simple way to answer your question, importantly, though, to frame. We look at all either growth or expansion of capability opportunities through buy-build-ally frameworks. We relentlessly go through a buy-build-ally framework. So for example, today within our Evernorth benefit portfolio, we're organically building out additional post acute care capabilities after evaluating buying, further partnering or insourcing those capabilities. We typically will look at that three, right-to-win, a strategic positioning and an economic framework. So you'll look at it through a variety of frameworks. It's not a simple economic hurdle rate. Your question didn't infer that it was a single measure, but it's not a single economic hurdle rate. It's through a right-to-win size and trajectory of the market, the resources with which to pursue whether it's organic build collaboration through a partnership, or from an acquisitive standpoint. And obviously, certain economic hurdle rates come into play, which we don't discuss probably, those are proprietary, but you would imagine we're quite disciplined in terms of our return to capital thresholds. Ricky, hope that helps?\nRicky Goldwasser: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Miss Goldwasser. Our next question comes from Mr. Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nSteve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So there was a question earlier on inflation. I actually have a question on deflation. Just want to check the box and get your quick thoughts on generic pricing as there's been some mixed signals and the level of generic deflation in the first quarter. I guess I was curious, was there any evidence of accelerated deflation that may have played a role in better cost of goods sold in your mail water operations within Evernorth? And also you mentioned the effective supply chain initiative again this quarter. Just curious what that means for 2021 in particular, whether is that just code for better drug purchasing and procurement this year? Are there other factors within the \"supply chain initiative\" driving better results? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, it's David. So two-point questions. First, there's no doubt there are some pockets of generic deflation within the within the pricing environment which is the cost environment. Importantly, they're in line with our expectations. So it's not a deviant or driver of deviation for us in any way shape or form in terms of our broad portfolio. But unequivocally there are some pockets of deflation there in line with our expectations. As relates to the supply chain activity, I would ask you just to continue to think about supply chain initiatives as being an inherent strength within the overall portfolio through a variety of lenses, whether it's collaboration on the medical side of the equation, the traditional supply chain activity, the value-based supply chain activity, et cetera. And we have a continuous drive to improve value, albeit, to partner as we go through the process and as we get into some more of the complex dimensions of the higher costs, drugs and medications, we think there's further opportunity through the supply chain activity around value based care relationships, aligned incentive relationships more specifically with the manufacturers and with ourselves on a go forward basis. So I wouldn't call out any unique driver. More importantly, it's a continuous improvement part of our portfolio, and it's an underlying strength of our portfolio. And lastly, our sustained growth supports that in a very positive way.\nSteve Valiquette: Got it? Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our last question comes from Mr. David Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.\nDavid Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to come back to the telemedicine topic and David thinking about your capital light strategy relative to providers and network. I'm wondering if Evernorth and Cigna has an opportunity to leverage MDLIVE into your collaborative care partnerships or otherwise into partnered networks as opposed to own networks in your case? And then alternatively, do you have an opportunity to use MDLIVE to feed volume or refer volume, catch volume if you so to speak in parts of -- other parts of Evernorth, especially pharmacy mail or delivery, things like that by owning and controlling telemedicine through MDLIVE?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. Appreciate the question. So twofold. The first part of your question, the simple answer is yes. So to be really clear. Again, we see the opportunity, obviously, from a standalone, if you will fulfillment and delivery of the service but also an opportunity in collaboration in alignment as a panel extender for high performing collaborative accountable care relationships. And those conversations are dynamic and underway. To the second part of your question, very thoughtful framework and appreciate it. If we come back and think about first and foremost, our ability to further improve affordability. You may recall at our Investor Day, we talked about four major ways in which we further improve affordability off of our strong overall cost environment today. One, is to further increase the percentage of utilization that takes place in the highest performing clinical settings, be they physicians or facilities. Second, is to work to reduce the cost of drugs further. Third, is to effectively leverage alternative sites of care. For example, the difference between a knee replacement that is inpatient versus outpatient is about a third less than cost. And we see a massive shift at the physical side of care is similar in virtual side of care. And then fourth, the ability to further coordinate the fragmented system specifically in the areas of medical and behavioral. So back to your question. Our evolution of our telemedicine and virtual care capability present opportunities to contribute to a variety of these areas to help to support individual customers or patients accessing higher cost healthcare specialists or delivery system partners, helping to drive further leverage relative to the pharmaceutical equation in terms of medication compliance, or alternative lower cost medications, and the ability to merge or coordinate services be the behavioral and pharmacy behavioral and medical are being in that quarterback position with a customer patient from that standpoint. So we see it as being complimentary to a variety of those initiatives. And we see it being both complimentary to your first question, proprietary driving on our own, and in collaboration is a panel extended for high performing healthcare professional partners. Thanks for the question.\nDavid Windley: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Windley. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: First, thanks for our time today. We really appreciate spending time to discuss our Cigna results and our outlook. I just want to wrap up our call with a few headlines. First and foremost, we delivered strong financial performance during the quarter as we continue to navigate through what is undoubtedly a dynamic environment. And we work to meet and balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, as we act as champions for healthcare that is affordable, predictable and simple. In addition, our strong foundation driven by our growth framework and track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our increased EPS outlook for 2021 of $20.20. As well as positions as well for our ongoing long term average annual revenue growth rate of 68% and our 10% to 13% average annual adjusted EPS growth rate, all while continuing to pay attractive dividend. With that again, we thank you for joining our call and we look forward to our future conversations.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2021 results review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter results, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business, and I'll discuss their updated outlook for the full year. Key consolidated financial highlights for first quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue of $41 billion, adjusted earnings of $1.7 billion after tax and adjusted earnings per share of $4.73. Results in the first quarter reflects strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. The favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non-recurring operating expenses. Our results reflect our ability to deliver a dynamic, rapidly evolving environment, including navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding our segments, our first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2021, adjusted revenues grew to $30.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings grew to $1.2 billion. Evernorth strong results in the quarter were driven by effective execution of supply chain initiatives, continued strong performance in Accredo, our industry leading specialty pharmacy, and organic growth of our services with deepening partnerships, all while continuing to invest for ongoing growth. Our adjusted pharmacy script volume was $393 million during the quarter, a 9% increase over first quarter 2020. Overall, Evernorth continued as positive momentum and delivered another strong quarter financial results. Turning to U.S. medical, we entered the year expecting to see the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment cost pressure in the U.S. medical segment in the first half of 2021, particularly in the first quarter. As we progress throughout the first quarter we saw COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations declined more rapidly than we originally anticipated. Additionally, as COVID-19 cases decelerated, we saw an increase in non-COVID utilization. Importantly, throughout all of this, we continue to see key components of preventive care, utilize the pre pandemic levels for U.S. commercial customer's taken as a whole and excluding prior year medical cost developments, our first quarter medical care ratio was in line with our expectations. With that as context, I'll now comment specifically on first quarter financial results for the U.S. medical segments. First quarter adjusted revenues were $10.4 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $987 million. Our first quarter U.S. medical earnings were slightly ahead of our expectations, primarily driven by favorable net investment income, and prior year medical cost development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Excluding these onetime factors, our us medical earnings were in line with our expectations. Turning to membership we ended the quarter with 16.7 million total medical customers, an increase of 30,000 customers sequentially. As expected, U.S. commercial customer volume declined sequentially due to disenrollment throughout the first quarter, partially offset by new sales in the Select segment. And our U.S. government businesses performed well throughout the annual open enrollment periods. Overall results for Cigna's U.S. medical segment reflect strong fundamentals. In our international markets business, first quarter adjusted revenues were $1.6 billion and adjusted pretax earnings were $262 million, reflecting business growth, favorable net investment income and foreign currency movements offset by higher claims costs during the period. I would also note that a refinements to the accounting for acquisition costs lead to a one-time favorable benefit in the first quarter of 2020 that did not recur in the current period. Corporate and other operations reflect a first quarter adjusted loss of $330 million. These results reflect lower interest expense due to lower levels of outstanding debt offset by the absence of contributions from the group disability and life business, which was invested on December 31, 2020. Overall, as a result of strong execution and a dynamic environment, we continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders and strong financial results across our businesses. Now looking forward to our outlook for full year 2021. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect continued strong execution across our growth platforms. And we expect to make continued meaningful investments in our businesses that are responsive to the forces changing healthcare, positioning us for continued long term growth. Taken as a whole, we are raising our prior guidance for full year 2021. We now expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $166 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability and life business. We now expect full year 2021 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7 billion or at least $20.20 per share. Within our outlook, we continue to expect a full year COVID-19 related headwind of approximately $1.25 per share, primarily within our U.S. medical business. And we continue to project an expense ratio in the range of 7.5% to 8%. I'll now discuss our 2021 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we now expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $5.65 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of at least 5%. This outlook reflects ongoing investments in our Evernorth portfolio, including investments in care solutions and MDLIVE as we continue to see significant opportunity to bring new innovative solutions to market. For U.S. medical, we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted earnings of at least $3.8 billion. This outlook reflects focused execution in our businesses, as we expect to drive organic customer growth and deepening of customer relationships. We expect direct COVID-19 related testing and treatment to decline throughout the balance of the year, and also anticipate more normalized non-COVID utilization. And with the strength of the U.S. medical first quarter results, we will further accelerate strategic investments to support future growth, thus leaving our full year earnings outlook for U.S. medical unchanged. Regarding total medical customers, we now expect 2021 growth of at least 350,000 customers. This includes organic growth throughout the remainder of the year in our commercial business, led by the middle market and select segments partially offset by disenrollment in national accounts. We also expect Medicare Advantage customer growth in our target average annual growth range of 10% to 15%. And we expect continue growth in our individual business. Turning to medical costs, we continue to expect the 2021 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82%, reflecting the impacts in 2021 of elevated medical costs, including the impact of direct COVID-19 related costs, and more normalized non-COVID utilization, and the repeal of the health insurance tax effective for 2021. All while we continue to deliver strong clinical quality and overall affordability for our clients and customers. We also expect continued growth and strong margins in international markets. All-in for full year 2021, we now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $7 billion, or at least $20.20 per share. Overall, these expected results reflect the differentiated value, strength and strategic positioning of our businesses as we deliver growth, while navigating the impacts associated with COVID-19. Now, moving to our 2021 capital management position and outlook, we expect our businesses to continue to drive exceptional cash flow with strong returns on capital, even as we continue reinvesting to support long term growth and innovation. For 2021, we continue to expect at least $7.5 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our well performing businesses. During the quarter, we met our previously stated share repurchase expectations and year to date as of May 6, 2021, we have repurchased 14.4 million shares for $3.2 billion. And we now expect full year 2021 weighted average shares of 346 million to 348 million shares. We ended first quarter 2021 with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 39.9%, in line with our long term target of approximately 40%. We had $2.5 billion of cash available to parents at the end of the quarter. And on April 28, we declared a $1 per share dividend payable on June 23 to shareholders of record as of June 8. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter reflect strong top line growth with contributions across our businesses. And first quarter earnings came in somewhat ahead of our expectations. These favorable first quarter earnings were primarily driven by strong Evernorth performance, favorable net investment income, and favorable prior year medical costs development, partially offset by non recurring operating expenses. Our strong results give us confidence in our increased outlook for full year 2021, all while continuing to support our customers, clients and co workers. As such, we now expect 2021 full year adjusted EPS of at least $20.20 per share, and have continued confidence in our long term growth targets. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning, Bob. It's Brian. So thanks for the question. And yes, we're really pleased with the strong start to the year in Evernorth, which as I mentioned in my comments, gives us the confidence to increase the full year guidance to at least $5.65 billion of operating income. Quarter-to-quarter there will be some level of variability in the segments. I would encourage you not to overreact to the singular quarter that we had here. But certainly pleased with 13% quarter-over-quarter earnings growth. I would remind you that our Prime Therapeutics partnership launched April 1, 2020. So the base period last year and the first quarter did not have contributions from Prime Therapeutics. So that was a bit of a benefit to this quarter that will not recur to the same degree for the balance of the year. So to your point on the operating income growth appearing to slow to some degree later in the year. That's one contribution that you should -- that they should keep in mind. Additionally, we continue to invest aggressively in Evernorth to expand and diversify the suite of solutions in that portfolio. So, as you think about Care Solutions, Benefits Management insights, we will make a continued organic and on a targeted basis in organic investments to continue to expand that portfolio, which will increase SG&A in to some degree temper the income growth for the balance of the year. David, anything you want to add to that? Good morning, Ralph. It's Brian. So maybe let me unpack the U.S. Medical non-recurring items a little bit. This might speak to the core of your question a little bit. As I mentioned in my comments, overall, our U.S. medical earnings in the quarter were above our expectations. But when you remove the effect of the three non-recurring items, we were in line with our expectations. So there's a three non recurring items that I cited, we had some favorability in the quarter and net investment income. We had some favorability in the quarter and prior year medical cost development, and that was offset by non-recurring operating expenses. And so, to the core of your question, the non-recurring operating expenses, you can think of as litigation-oriented matters associated with operations from several years ago. So these are not related to current time periods. These are unrelated to Anthem. These are matters from several years ago, but they're related to operations. And as a result of that, we chose to book them through SG&A as opposed to considering them as a special item below the line or anything like that. They were appropriate in our eyes to book through SG&A above the line. And in order of magnitude, you can think of that as approximately offsetting the favorable benefit that we had from net investment income in the quarter within U.S. medical. But those are truly non-recurring items since they're related to periods from several years ago and those matters should now be closed. Yes. Good morning, Justin. So, just a few other comments on the quarter and the balance of the year. Overall, as I mentioned in my comments, the U.S. Medical MCR was in line with our expectations for the first quarter, when you exclude the benefit of PYD [ph], or prior development. When you include the benefit of prior year development, we're actually a little bit favorable on the first quarter. And that was at an elevated level, as we expected, when we stepped into the year. For the balance of the year, we expect that deceleration in COVID-19, testing and treatment costs, we expect an uptick in non-COVID related utilization in quarters two through four, with those factors roughly offsetting one another. And so, when we constructed our full year outlook of an 81% to 82% medical care ratio, we stress tested a variety of scenarios about -- associate with those two levers and are quite confident in our ability to achieve the full year 81% to 82% medical care ratio for U.S. medical. David, maybe on the Texas Medicaid and our broader Medicaid strategy, over to you sure. Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, a few thoughts on your question. I appreciate the framing of it. Broadly in the quarter, as I said earlier, the MCR for U.S. Medical was in line with our expectations when you include the federal benefit from prior year development. Now the components within were a little bit different than we anticipated. So to your point, the COVID-19 testing and treatment burden on our book was a little bit lower than we anticipated for the quarter. However, non COVID utilization was a little bit higher than we anticipated coming into the quarter. So net effect of those two factors led to the U.S. Medical MCR, being back in line with where we expected it to be. As we trend out the balance of the year, we continue to expect that phenomenon to perceive, meaning, deceleration in COVID-19 testing and treatment costs, and a little bit of an uptick in non COVID related utilization. So to your point, we expect about 50% of the EPS headwind associated with COVID-19, a $1.25 to continue to show up in the U.S. Medical MCR. And bridging over into 2022, we continue to anticipate about half of that $1.25, or a little bit over half of that to return in the form of earnings in our 2022 enterprise portfolio. And as such, we would expect that our long term annual growth rate in EPS of 10% to 13%. We would expect to achieve results that's at or above the high end of that range relative to our updated guidance of at least $20.20 per share. Sure. Good morning, Josh. Our individual membership year to-date is a little bit above our expectations for a couple of different reasons. One is, I'm sure you know, we stepped into 80 new counties in 2021. And the enrollment, the annual enrollment period there was a little bit above our expectations. Additionally, the expanded special enrollment period window that President Biden introduced has generated some new lives in our portfolio as of the end of the first quarter. We have no reason to believe at this juncture that those customers will perform meaningfully differently than the balance of our individual exchange portfolio to your point on when will we know for sure. It will take several months, as we understand the risk adjuster profile, and the persistency of those new lives, et cetera. But I also would remind you the individual exchange membership only represents about 5%, 6% of our total U.S. Medical portfolio. So it won't be a significant needle mover relative to the MCR for your outlook for U.S. Medical. Good morning, Scott. So really pleased with the Q1 performance on revenue as well as the full year increase in our guidance of at least $166 billion. You should think of the majority of that increase coming from the Evernorth segment. But importantly, we're also seeing strength within U.S. Medical. So we think of most of it from Evernorth and a bit of an uptick in U.S. Medical as well. David, back to you on the inflation question."

            "content": "Thanks, Alexis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. But today's we meet our environment remains highly dynamic with COVID-19 continues to affect the world, our industry and our economy. At Cigna, this rapidly changing landscape has only reinforced the tremendous responsibility we have to improve the health, wellbeing and peace of mind of those we serve. This remains the primary focus that drives our 70,000 co-workers each and every day. And it's the reason we work to continue to deliver for our customers, clients, patients, partners and our communities, all while delivering strong financial results for you, our shareholders. During the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $41 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.73 per share. We also deployed significant capital to our investors through share repurchase and the payment of a meaningful quarterly dividend, reinforcing the strength of our capital like framework. Building on our conversation from several weeks ago at our Investor Day, today, I'm going to talk more about how we are continuing to navigate through the current environment to balance and meet the needs of all of our stakeholders, our ability to consistently deliver strong results by executing on a growth framework and the competence we have in achieving our increased outlook by delivering differentiated and sustained growth for the long term. Then Brian will share more details about our first quarter results and our 2021 outlook. And after that, we'll take your questions. Since we last met at our Investor Day in March, the macro landscape remains fluid. In the U.S. proposed legislation as well as regulation and executive actions to expand extend and further support both public and private programs. Globally, social and political tensions remain high as COVID-19 with its multiple variants continue to take a toll on a number of countries, such as India, where cases have again dramatically spiked. All these forces are shaping healthcare and influencing the political and economic landscape around the world. At Cigna, we are navigating through this environment by continue to innovate for and support our stakeholders with COVID-19 services, while also executing other strategies to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple For U.S. commercial customers, we're ensuring they get the preventative care they need, including mammographies, colonoscopies, cervical cancer screenings, and childhood immunizations, which today are consistent with pre pandemic levels, reflecting the continued strength of our clinical programs, and proven engagement capabilities. Within Evernorth, for those customers served by Express Scripts home delivery, we've delivered further improvements in medication adherence for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. At the same time, we're also supporting the mental wellbeing of our customers. We're doing this through our own best-in-class capabilities where for example, we engage with oncology patients with comorbidities by spending an average of $2,000 on their behavioral health care, we can save an average of $20,000 in avoidable costs. And we can innovate and leverage our strategic partnerships, including, for example, with Ginger, through Cigna ventures, which provides industry leading on demand 24x7 behavioral health coach and further extending our behavioral health access for the benefit of our customers. We're also leveraging data in actionable intelligence to understand the most common long term complications of COVID-19 infection, then building predictive models to determine who is at greatest risk of becoming a COVID law hauler, so we can quickly provide targeted case management and behavioral health services, as well as other resources to help our customers regain their health. For our clients, we're serving as a trusted partner. by supplying additional physical and behavioral health assistance to aid in the recovery for employees who are infected by COVID-19. We're helping employers build their own communities of immunity by assisting them in launching vaccination clinics. And we're collecting our data and analytics help employers determine when and how it is safe for employees to return to work. For provider partners, we're working to guide people to the most effective sites of care and further closing gaps in care with our clinical teams and our virtual capabilities. For coworkers, we're supporting them in this highly disruptive environment by for example, providing $200 incentive for co-workers who choose to become vaccinated for COVID-19 and continuing to offer expanded leave capabilities with our emergency time off program to provide flexibility necessitated by the current conditions. And finally, for our communities, we're taking steps to address social determinants of health. For example, we all know the alarming statistics on the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on communities of color. As part of our safe initiative, we brought additional underground resources to target communities by launching COVID-19 awareness campaigns, distributing PP&E kits, dispatching our health improvement mobile resources to help you administer free flu shots and provide healthy meal, as well as other support. Similarly, we're leaning in to fight breast cancer with disparities, for example, well, amongst black women remain startling, tough to address this disparity gap, we again went directly into communities. Starting in Tennessee, for example, where we collaborated with local partners to offer mobile mammography vans at churches, and at other local neighborhood locations. At Cigna, balancing the needs of our stakeholders is deeply rooted in our corporate purpose. We constantly challenge ourselves by asking the basic question, what more could we do to help us stay focused on delivering each and every day for the benefit of our customers, our clients, patients and our partners. Against this backdrop, the strength of our foundation propels us forward and guides our growth. As we share with you at our Investor Day, through our three growth platforms Evernorth, U.S. Medical and International Markets, we are well positioned to leverage the three trends we see shaping healthcare into the future, specifically, pharmacological innovations, the rising demand for coordinated mental and physical health services, and the changing preferences as it relates to access to care models. And through a proven framework, we're able to drive attractive sustained growth by delivering differentiated value within our portfolio of integrated, coordinated endpoint solutions, continuing to work to partner and innovate, and working to expand our addressable markets. As a result, we're off to a strong start in 2021, with strong fundamental execution, and the strategic and capital flexibility to further our momentum into the future. During the first quarter Evernorth continue to build on its differentiated and steady performance it had delivered throughout the pandemic, by evolving the healthcare experience for our customers and clients through continuous innovation, and by building investing, and strengthening our strategic partnerships. For example, in January, we further expanded our partnership with Prime Therapeutics by leveraging our home delivery and Accredo Specialty Pharmacy to drive greater value and delivering our promise to make healthcare more affordable. We're also advancing our strategic capabilities with our MDLIVE acquisition which closed last month. This acquisition will expand Evernorth's cares ability to further broaden access, lower cost of care, and strategically positioned us to grow in the rapidly changing access to care environment. At the same time, Evernorth pharmacy is also driving affordability improvement. One example is our patient assurance program, which caps the cost of prescriptions for patients with diabetes. During the quarter the number of patients in this program increased by 64%. And the value of patients delivered from this program is on track to more than double what we achieved last year. Turning to our U.S. medical platform, we see bright spots and growth in our U.S. commercial portfolio. For example, we continue to take share in the Select segment, which includes employers with 51 to 500 employees. As clients continue to value our integrated, align, self funded, medical, pharmacy behavioral and stop-loss programs. And more broadly, we're driving value by bringing differentiated offerings to market fueled by innovations and advancements we are accessing from our Evernorth capabilities, particularly in areas of pharmacy services, and behavioral health. Through our willingness to strategically partner with innovative companies like Oscar, we're also well positioned to take advantage of market growth opportunities in the small employer market, a market we view is currently being underserved. As a result, we expect to see an uptick in growth in our U.S. Commercial platform during the residual part of this year. Additionally, one important impact of the pandemic is that businesses have expanded access to support services for the employees, backing is a trusted source of information and providing an extended range of benefits to support whole person health. As more and more employers recognize the critical link between mental and physical health. In the wake of COVID-19, more employers are also recognizing the connection between healthy workers, higher productivity and a growing economy. In fact, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that in the U.S., we benefited by $1.5 trillion of value by having employers play a major role in health care. This reinforces the critical role, our U.S. healthcare business plays as an important partner to employers in providing access to quality, affordable care for the benefit of their employees. Turning to U.S. government business, we're driving strong year-over-year customer growth by continuing to expand our addressable markets. The number of Medicare Advantage customers increased by 11% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing execution of our strategy, as well as our sustained strong star performance. And the number of customers in our individual and family plan business grew by 17% year over year, driven by our geographic expansion, and the introduction of new plans that provide expanded coverage for maintenance drugs, to further improve affordability for customers with certain chronic conditions. In our International Markets business, we're focused on actively supporting our co workers, customers and partners around the world who continue to be impacted by COVID-19. For example, in India, our foundation is providing financial support through UNICEF to meet the critical needs on the ground, including additional rapid testing capabilities and expanded access to vaccines. And we're providing matching gifts from the Cigna foundation to our co-workers who donate to charities in India. Staying true to our mission is not only the right thing to do, it reinforced to our clients, our customers and our patients, our commitment to make a difference in the moments that matter most. Our purpose driven orientation, together with our strategic flexibility created by our service based model and recapitalize framework that generates significant cash flow from operations, as well as our track record of strong financial performance, where we delivered a 15% adjusted EPS compounded growth rate over the last decade, all give us confidence we will continue to sustainably grow in both the short term and the long term in this dynamic environment. And now taking into account the strength of our first quarter results, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be at least $20.20 in 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our long term targets of average annual adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% and continue to play an attractive dividend while delivering cumulative operating cash flow growth of $50 billion through 2025. Now to briefly summarize, we delivered strong first quarter results by executing our growth framework, while harnessing our capital strength to deploy meaningful capital for the benefit of our shareholders, reinvesting in our business, and leveraging our strategic flexibility to continue to innovate and adapt, all of which sets us up for sustained long term success. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow as we focus our efforts to make healthcare more affordable, predictable and simple each and every day. Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Just highlighting the fact that in support of that, for example, our Evernorth Benefits business performed very strongly in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, that was a partial contributor to the year-over-year increase as Brian articulated. And we remain committed to continue to invest in the businesses, all while meeting now our increased earnings outlook for the full year. Hey, Justin. Good morning. It's David. Let me just frame the medical costs for a moment and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more about our framework and our expectations for the year. And then I'll come back and address the Medicaid divestiture and our Medicaid direction more broadly. First, from a medical cost standpoint, big picture. We're pleased with the start to the year. Big picture broadly speaking, we're pleased to start to the year. And I just want to underscore a couple of components. One, our organization works tirelessly to try to drive elevated utilization of certain services like preventative care services. And importantly, we saw in the first quarter, the use of preventative care services like mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screenings to be at an approximate level of pre-pandemic levels. That's a tremendous result of offsetting what might have been a dampening to utilization. The national data we see more broadly is that utilization of those preventative care services is at a more dampened rate, but ours is an elevated or more consistent rate from that standpoint, which is quite important. Secondly, I would just remind you that and I'll tie this back in our Medicaid comment a little later, is that we have a de minimis amount of Medicaid within our portfolio. And our national data suggests to our services businesses, through Evernorth services business that in the first quarter Medicaid medical costs were a bit more dampened year-over-year in the first quarter of 2021. That's not an effect on our portfolio. But we can see that in the services that we're providing. And I'll ask Brian to give you a little bit more color forward looking on the year, then I'll come back and address Medicaid. Sure. Justin. We chose to divest of that single site Medicaid operation we had. So number one, it was -- we have one of one. So it was one off within our portfolio that has a de minimis impact on our P&L at the enterprise level. So putting that aside, we determined it was best for that business to be served by an expert or specialist. And we're pleased to effectuate and seek to close a successful transition to Molina. We think that's beneficial to the customers being served than our co-workers in that business. Looking forward, we continue to see Medicaid and government services first and foremost as an attractive growth opportunity within our Evernorth service portfolio. Whether it's Evernorth Pharmacy, Evernorth Care, Evernorth Benefits, Evernorth Intelligence, the opportunity to bring expanded services largely through health plans today in support of Medicaid will be a growing organic part of our portfolio. Over time, we see opportunities that will manifest themselves state-by-state on state specific service relationships against Evernorth. And then finally, as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, within our M&A priority, we continue to have an expansion of our U.S. government programs as an M&A priority. So we'll be opportunistic from that standpoint, if we see the ability to further strengthen any of our capabilities looking forward. But that divestiture was again, it was a one-off de minimis impact and we deemed that was best in the hands of a specialist. Thanks, Justin. So thanks for the question, George. So specific to MDLIVE, first important to reference the fact that we had a multiyear relationship with MVLIVE both partnering to continue the services, but also through our very successful multiyear Cigna Ventures organization. So, we start from a learned shared experience and even deeper collaboration during the COVID environment. Specific to the asset and the direction, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we see rapid expansion of what we call alternative side of care to be one of the three major trends as we look forward over the next five to 10 years. This is an important part of those building blocks, and it's an important part of our Evernorth care portfolio of capabilities. We see it as much greater than telemed or even basic virtual care triaging. We see the ability to obviously expand virtual care, primary care, behavioral care. We see the ability to expand that further in terms of longitudinal chronic care programs, polychronic, and ultimately complex care programs and capabilities. So it provides us an accelerant to our strategic direction with a known partner that will now be part of the overall Cigna portfolio. And we're excited. Because net-net, it drives, improved service, improved access, improved affordability with strong clinical outcomes for the benefit of our consumers. So truly an aggregate win-win in the portfolio. Specific to the digital formulary that innovation continues to be somewhat unique in the marketplace. Our clients really appreciate the approach relative to the digital formulary, helping to essentially curate and apply externally validated expertise to the vast array of digital alternatives that exists in the ecosystem to help, to provide employers more informed decisions for those that may have the greatest outcome and impact for the benefit of the customer. So, I view that as a part of our consultative approach in terms of providing support, and a part of our approach to -- in this case partner and curate additional services on a go forward basis. Taking in the whole, we see, again, our Evernorth care capabilities as an exciting part of the broader economic growth capabilities, and we see the ability to do that in a complimentary nature with our proven value based care relationships within our Cigna, our portfolio as well. Hope that helps, George. A.J. Good morning, it's David. So relative to the selling season, looking to 2022, your question goes at the commercial side, as well as the services side of the business. First, on the commercial side of the portfolio, at this stage of the year, we're typically looking at the national accounts environment. And remind you that we define national accounts in -- for our U.S. commercial portfolio a little bit more narrowly than some in the market. So it's commercial employers, 5,000 or more employees who are multi-state in nature. As we look to 2022, right now, we see an environment where the RFP volume, so the opportunity to pursue new business is up somewhat. I think order of magnitude 10%. And we see the portion of our book of business that's out to bid is being up marginally less than that 10% number. So that's a little bit of framing. We have some early traction, some early wins, that exists in our portfolio. And as we sit here at this stage of the environment, we're optimistic that we'll have a very good commercial outlook in aggregate for our portfolio as we look to 2020. I'll bridge with a trend comment and then I'll come to the Evernorthportfolio. Clearly affordability remains a top decision criteria for commercial employers,. There's no doubt about that. We spent ample time on that at our Investor Day, and it remains a top strategic imperative. Further, beyond that is the flexibility necessary, and then the innovation required to truly integrate or coordinate mental and physical health programs, and then expand and coordinate access to care in a less fragmented way through alternative site of care framework, et cetera. So we see the trends being well lined up to our direction. As relates to within Evernorth and specific to your question within pharmacy services. As you recall, we have now multiple years of very attractive growth under our belts as a combined organization. And we're pleased with that. As we look to 2022, we have an environment where to date our employer renewal process is manifesting itself quite strongly. And our health plan renewal process is manifesting itself rather strongly beyond the two known losses that we previously discussed, relative to the health plan business. Taken as a whole, we'd expect the retention in that business as we sit here right now to be a bit less than our recent couple of years, which have been historic highs in the upper 90s, we'll expect it to be more in the mid 90s as a consistent rate. And then taken as a whole, we will expect to see both revenue and earnings growth in our Evernorth portfolio in 2022. So, both pointing in a positive direction would be the summary I would leave you with. Lisa, thanks. Appreciate the ongoing interest in the space for sure. So number one, bigger picture framing, I appreciate that you brought MDLIVE, Ginger together, for example. We don't -- we do not believe that this is a one-and-done type activity. So, we don't believe that a corporation secures itself a virtual care asset. And then this were for the alternative delivery space. This is a fluid environment. It's a dynamic environment, and it's an environment that has massive promise relative to bringing the expanded access, coordination of services, and improve overall value coming back to the affordability. Our organic capabilities are strong, the MDLIVE asset advances that massively. But as Brian noted in his prior comments, as well, we continue to invest in the space. So I want you to view that we view it as a dynamic and fluid space and we very much like our positioning. Two is, just like in the -- what we'll call it the traditional care delivery space, the coordination of physical and mental health is mission critical. Just because it's in a virtual care environment, doesn't mean that the coordination of the leverage opportunity there is not -- is critical. And in fact, the virtual capabilities allow us to take fragmentation out of the system more aggressively and more comprehensively. To your affordability comment, unequivocally, we see an ability to further improve affordability through alternative site of care and through our virtual capabilities. You may recall from Investor Day, we identified alternative site of care or site of care leverage as a meaningful opportunity to further deflect or improve overall affordability. And an example maybe, we see already in a virtual care delivery, less use of unnecessary or redundant diagnostic services. That's a tangible illustration of a improvement in affordability. Conversely, we see opportunities to even further close gaps in care or increase utilization of the right services, like maintenance medications, through the dynamic, more intimate, ongoing interaction with customers or patients from that standpoint. So my points are threefold. One, continuation of investment here and innovation off of a very strong base. Two, a continued need to use the capabilities to close fragmentation within the system or get more complimentary leverage, most notably between the medical health and the mental health capabilities. And three, unequivocally a contributor to further improved affordability. Hey, Josh, good morning. It's David. Let me just start and frame the growth trajectory. And then ask Brian to will provide a little bit of additional color, relative to our insights on the performance. First, we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the sustained performance starting with the individual exchanges. Just as you recall, we entered the exchanges in the first year, and we've sustained engagement in the exchanges since its inception. We've innovated within the exchanges. We've delivered a proven model. And now we're in an expansion mode relative to additional geographies, in large part with our collaborative accountable care and aligned value based relationships from the healthcare delivery system. And we're pleased with the results, both the base results in individual exchange, as well as thus far our early look at the additional enrollment we're seeing because the expanded SEP. I'll ask Brian just give you a little color relative to that dimension. As relates to the small employer marketplace. As you know, we, Cigna historically have not played in the small employer marketplace. What we've focused above 51 lives or above 100 lives depending on the regulation more broadly. We have continued to view it as an underserved market, a market that has had more traditional or rigidly designed programs, less innovation and less flexibility, and less leverage of more modern specialty and clinical services. And our determination was, it was best to pursue that market in partnership, leveraging our partnership DNA. And we've entered that market successfully with our partnership with Oscar. We're really early in that journey, some positive indicators for sure, we're really in the journey. Our early indicators are positive, though, that has us accelerating our geographies. And in collaboration with Oscar, and again back to in partnership with our healthcare delivery partners. So, Brian, maybe just a little color in terms of what we view the SEP process looking like and the economics within the individual exchange? Scott, good morning. It's David. I'm going to ask Brian, just to give you a little color on our really strong sustained revenue performance. And then I'll come back and seek to address your inflation question. Sure. Scott, on the inflation question, I'm going to come out with two ways. First, through the core visibility of our business and then more broadly for those we serve. Thus far within our business, we do not see a large trajectory change relative to what I would call cost of goods sold inflationary pressure. There's always some, makes no doubt about it. There is always some. But through ongoing innovation, ongoing productivity, ongoing value based collaboration, broadly speaking, I would not call a large sea [ph] change from that standpoint. Beyond that, in the broader economy, whether we look at it through a U.S. lens or pockets of markets outside the United States, there's clearly a warming up. There's an indisputable warming up of the economy. And there's a clearly warming up of inflationary indicators, but none of which have triggered across a threshold to suggest any one industry safe for some unique outliers, any kind of orange going to red threshold levels of inflation, but the robustness of the economy and some of the underlying cost drivers in some sub sectors are slowly beginning to elevate. And I think have a lot of industry leaders watching to ensure that any movement in curves, any movement in cost curves could be anticipated, either eradicated through pricing actions, like CPG companies that are being intensively discussed, cost pressures in some sub sectors of the technology ecosystem where the chip industry is out of pattern relative to supply and demand from that standpoint. But broadly speaking, I would say again, nothing affecting our space over the immediate term horizon from an inflationary standpoint. Matthew, a pretty complex, Rubik's cube would put on the table. Thoughtful, but nonetheless complex. I think a you -- as I think your question and [Indiscernible] question. If we look at the 2020 to 2021 environment, clearly, the posture of CMS recognize the COVID dislocation, recognize that dislocation, for examples, implication on risk adjusters sought to in their own methodology, seek to provide some offset to that relative to their rate setting environment, as well as their guidance relative to delivery system reimbursement, and set themselves up for what I would say is a pretty fluid and complex environment over the ensuing couple of years ahead. So, I would expect the next couple years cycle to be a little non-traditional from that standpoint, given the need to adjust the various moving parts that result in a net rate setting environment. History would tell us that the result of all of the above, plus or minus a point or two largely gets the program to a balanced sustainable outcome. And looking forward, I would expect that because the Medicare Advantage program continues to deliver outstanding value, as you know, for seniors, hence the tremendous support from a senior standpoint, as well as overall clinical quality and affordability of which through the bonus programs and the reimbursement programs the federal government's budget actually benefits from. So I would expect it to be able to be balanced for that, but a little bit more lumpy than it has been in the past. And I think this year's risk adjuster through ups will be really mission critical in terms of how CMS sees the industry, recapturing a little bit more of the information that they deem necessary to get the risk adjusters and then they'll factor that into the forward looking 2023 rate environment. Stay tuned for more. Ricky, good morning, It's David. We're going to take both of your questions. And your first question. To be very clear, we have seen consistent, strong utilization of preventative care services. And notably, what I called out is, for example, in the first quarter of 2021, broadly speaking, preventative care services inclusive of mammographies, colonoscopies, childhood immunizations, cervical cancer screening, plus or minus in the commercial portfolio business, approximate pre pandemic levels. We think that's a very good thing. I mean, underscore. It's a very good thing and something that our team has worked tirelessly to try to effectuate elevating those levels. We see that performance against a national dataset that suggests the utilization of those preventative care services are down versus pre pandemic levels 10% to 15% for our book of business they are not. As a predictor then to the future, we see that as a mitigant for an elevation of acuity, all other things remaining equal, because you're consistently identifying an earlier stage through the preventative diagnostics or the preventative services. Equally as important, as I noted in my prepared remarks, are, for example, within our Evernorth portfolio and within our Evernorth Pharmacy portfolio, for those customers being served by our mail order, we've actually seen get even further elevation of medication adherence. That's really important for the chronic population to avoid spikes in acuity moving forward, whether it's for a diabetic, COPD, asthmatic or other patients from that standpoint. So, broadly speaking, we're working tirelessly to get the right clinical quality and services to be consumed and supported with the clinical resources we have to avert spikes and acuity going forward. And therefore we don't expect a large spike in acuity on a look forward basis, given the strong preventative or medication compliance. As it relates to your M&A question, there's not a simple way to answer your question, importantly, though, to frame. We look at all either growth or expansion of capability opportunities through buy-build-ally frameworks. We relentlessly go through a buy-build-ally framework. So for example, today within our Evernorth benefit portfolio, we're organically building out additional post acute care capabilities after evaluating buying, further partnering or insourcing those capabilities. We typically will look at that three, right-to-win, a strategic positioning and an economic framework. So you'll look at it through a variety of frameworks. It's not a simple economic hurdle rate. Your question didn't infer that it was a single measure, but it's not a single economic hurdle rate. It's through a right-to-win size and trajectory of the market, the resources with which to pursue whether it's organic build collaboration through a partnership, or from an acquisitive standpoint. And obviously, certain economic hurdle rates come into play, which we don't discuss probably, those are proprietary, but you would imagine we're quite disciplined in terms of our return to capital thresholds. Ricky, hope that helps? Good morning, it's David. So two-point questions. First, there's no doubt there are some pockets of generic deflation within the within the pricing environment which is the cost environment. Importantly, they're in line with our expectations. So it's not a deviant or driver of deviation for us in any way shape or form in terms of our broad portfolio. But unequivocally there are some pockets of deflation there in line with our expectations. As relates to the supply chain activity, I would ask you just to continue to think about supply chain initiatives as being an inherent strength within the overall portfolio through a variety of lenses, whether it's collaboration on the medical side of the equation, the traditional supply chain activity, the value-based supply chain activity, et cetera. And we have a continuous drive to improve value, albeit, to partner as we go through the process and as we get into some more of the complex dimensions of the higher costs, drugs and medications, we think there's further opportunity through the supply chain activity around value based care relationships, aligned incentive relationships more specifically with the manufacturers and with ourselves on a go forward basis. So I wouldn't call out any unique driver. More importantly, it's a continuous improvement part of our portfolio, and it's an underlying strength of our portfolio. And lastly, our sustained growth supports that in a very positive way. Good morning. Appreciate the question. So twofold. The first part of your question, the simple answer is yes. So to be really clear. Again, we see the opportunity, obviously, from a standalone, if you will fulfillment and delivery of the service but also an opportunity in collaboration in alignment as a panel extender for high performing collaborative accountable care relationships. And those conversations are dynamic and underway. To the second part of your question, very thoughtful framework and appreciate it. If we come back and think about first and foremost, our ability to further improve affordability. You may recall at our Investor Day, we talked about four major ways in which we further improve affordability off of our strong overall cost environment today. One, is to further increase the percentage of utilization that takes place in the highest performing clinical settings, be they physicians or facilities. Second, is to work to reduce the cost of drugs further. Third, is to effectively leverage alternative sites of care. For example, the difference between a knee replacement that is inpatient versus outpatient is about a third less than cost. And we see a massive shift at the physical side of care is similar in virtual side of care. And then fourth, the ability to further coordinate the fragmented system specifically in the areas of medical and behavioral. So back to your question. Our evolution of our telemedicine and virtual care capability present opportunities to contribute to a variety of these areas to help to support individual customers or patients accessing higher cost healthcare specialists or delivery system partners, helping to drive further leverage relative to the pharmaceutical equation in terms of medication compliance, or alternative lower cost medications, and the ability to merge or coordinate services be the behavioral and pharmacy behavioral and medical are being in that quarterback position with a customer patient from that standpoint. So we see it as being complimentary to a variety of those initiatives. And we see it being both complimentary to your first question, proprietary driving on our own, and in collaboration is a panel extended for high performing healthcare professional partners. Thanks for the question. First, thanks for our time today. We really appreciate spending time to discuss our Cigna results and our outlook. I just want to wrap up our call with a few headlines. First and foremost, we delivered strong financial performance during the quarter as we continue to navigate through what is undoubtedly a dynamic environment. And we work to meet and balance the needs of all of our stakeholders, as we act as champions for healthcare that is affordable, predictable and simple. In addition, our strong foundation driven by our growth framework and track record of success gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our increased EPS outlook for 2021 of $20.20. As well as positions as well for our ongoing long term average annual revenue growth rate of 68% and our 10% to 13% average annual adjusted EPS growth rate, all while continuing to pay attractive dividend. With that again, we thank you for joining our call and we look forward to our future conversations."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded.  We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as our financial outlook for 2023. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in our cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $17 million or $0.06 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $56 million or $0.18 per share for costs associated with the sale of businesses. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani : Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. 2022 was a pivotal year of performance and growth for our company. Evernorth further expanded its health service reach and impact, and Cigna Healthcare demonstrated tremendous resilience in the dynamic market. Together, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and earnings outlook and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. This provides us with momentum as we begin 2023 and we expect another year of customer and earnings growth as we innovate and expand our broad portfolio of services and capabilities. Today, I'll provide perspective about our key drivers for our 2022 performance and how we're positioned for sustained growth going forward. Then Brian will walk through additional details about our 2022 financial results and discuss our '23 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. So let's jump in. As we reflect on our performance for 2022, I'm proud of what the company and Cigna team delivered overall. We grew full year revenues to approximately $181 billion. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $23.27 reflecting a 14% rate of growth. We returned $9 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, and we sharpened the health service focus of our international business through the divestiture of our life accident and supplemental benefits businesses across seven markets. This performance demonstrates how well our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are strategically positioned for sustained attractive growth.  In 2022, Evernorth delivered strong top and bottom line growth and also won, renewed and expanded several large multiyear client relationships for 2023 and beyond. The depth of Evernorth's capabilities and expertise is highly valued by our clients and partners and enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire portfolio of businesses. Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform also had a strong year, delivering customer growth along with differentiated medical cost performance for the benefit of our customers and clients. Our U.S. Commercial business had a standout performance achieving outsized customer growth while maintaining pricing discipline and driving margin improvement. This reflects our ability of our Commercial team to work consultatively to help employers of all sizes manage affordability, all while we support healthy, highly engaged employees for the benefit of their businesses. Overall, we're pleased with the strength of our 2022 performance across our enterprise. As we look to 2023, we continue to deliver and capture meaningful value in multiple ways. First, we expect sustained growth through our foundational businesses, Pharmacy Benefit Services, U.S. Commercial and International Health. These are mature scaled businesses that have established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental agencies. The value proposition for these businesses continues to resonate very well in the marketplace.  In Pharmacy Benefit Services, we expect continued contributions in 2023 through the strength of our unique solutions and partnership orientation. With the strong selling season across our employer, health plan and governmental agency portfolio, we will continue delivering greater affordability to more customers and patients. Additionally, we are investing meaningfully to put in place the teams and resources to make prescriptions more accessible and affordable for approximately 20 million Centene customers starting in 2024. In the U.S. Commercial business, we also had a strong 2023 selling season across all our market segments and across all funding types, self-funded risk and shared return arrangements. As a result, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth.  And in International Health, we expect continued revenue and earnings contributions through our leadership in meeting the health and wellbeing needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile. Second, we expect outsized growth from our accelerated businesses, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and U.S. government. These businesses have differentiated capabilities and platforms addressing accelerated secular growth trends. With Accredo, we were able to lower cost for patients and plans while preserving choice and flexibility for those who could benefit from new drugs. This includes our work to increase the availability of biosimilars. We've seen a handful of these lower-cost alternatives for biologic drugs launched in the past few years and understand the exceptional value they deliver for the benefit of clients and customers. 2023 will mark the start of a growing market opportunity for biosimilars, a trend that we expect to continue ramping up in 2024 and beyond. This includes HUMIRA, a treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions and one of the top-selling drugs globally over the past decade. Now there's a biosimilar alternative that we've co-preferred on a national preferred formulary creating significant savings opportunities for clients and customers. We will continue our leadership in advocating for greater availability of biosimilars, which over time, we expect to drive even more savings and benefit for patients and clients. In Evernorth Care Services, we are continuing to enhance and expand our portfolio of capabilities in care management and care delivery. Last year, MDLIVE virtual patient visits grew meaningfully, including a substantial increase in primary care visits. Demand and satisfaction with virtual care is rising and we will continue expanding our MDLIVE platform to provide even more of these options for the benefit of our customers. Evernorth Care Services is also accelerating our value-based care capabilities through our recently announced partnership with VillageMD. Our wrapping Evernorth health service capabilities with VillageMD's network of physicians, we will help guide more patients to high-quality care experiences at lower overall total costs. We expect this partnership to begin rolling out over the course of this year. In the U.S. government, another accelerated business, we expect strong growth in 2023 as we expand services and our geographic presence across a large and growing addressable market. This includes Medicare Advantage, where we will introduce enhanced services and benefits, and we nearly doubled the size of our provider network over the last two years as we expand into new geographies. Additionally, as we have demonstrated continued consistent commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, in a dynamic environment, our Individual & Family Plan business, we will see outsized customer growth in 2023. The third growth driver for us in 2023 and beyond is enterprise leverage. This is where our businesses work together to create or capture more value than anyone could achieve on their own. Here, think about our ability to look across our enterprise and client relationships to broaden and deepen them by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities. A great example is a new large service-based relationship for Cigna Healthcare where we were able to expand our support for a long-served Evernorth client. Additionally, the depth of clinical expertise success in advancing innovation and breadth of solutions within Evernorth, all combined to help further improve Cigna Healthcare's value proposition. For example, in 2022, by harnessing Evernorth's capabilities and programs, Cigna Healthcare delivered exceptional affordability, a key reason it continues to be competitively attractive option for employers of all sizes. This ability to deliver meaningful value is what makes Evernorth a partner of choice to a wide range of health plans, large employers and other clients. Another way we generate enterprise leverage is with our longitudinal portfolio data, which enables us to accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. This is specifically how we developed our Pathwell programs where we're able to integrate Cigna Healthcare's high-performing provider networks and benefits management with Evernorth's analytical and clinical expertise as well as personalized digital support. This equips Pathwell to lower cost while connecting patients with the right care, anticipating their future needs and helping them recover more quickly. Pathwell\u2019s focus in 2023 includes musculoskeletal conditions and patients who take injectable or infusible biologic drugs. Early feedback here has been very positive, and we expect to support millions of patients throughout these programs with better experience, clinical quality, costs, resulting in improved overall value. These examples illustrate just some of the impact we've already achieved with our cross-enterprise leverage, and we'll continue acting on additional opportunities in the years ahead to expand relationships, accelerate innovation for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. Now I'll briefly summarize. 2022 was a strong year of performance and growth for our company. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, and our durable growth framework, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners as we look to the future. We are delivering on our commitments to our shareholders with our 2022 adjusted EPS of $23.27 and returning $9 billion in share repurchase and dividends. And we are also responding to evolving needs of those we serve in the coming years in the Healthcare environment of accelerated change. We have a differentiated innovation pipeline that will allow us to build on our momentum and create value, continue to advance our growth strategy. We are confident 2023 will be another year of strong performance for our company as we expect to deliver customer and earnings growth. Our EPS outlook of at least $24.60 and the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend reinforced our commitment to sustained impact and growth for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko : Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2023. We're very pleased with our strong performance in 2022, reflecting focused execution and growth across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, with each segment achieving pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line or above our long-term targets. This positions us well for continued growth in 2023.  Looking at full year 2022 specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of approximately $181 billion, and adjusted earnings of $7.3 billion after tax or $23.27 per share, reflecting 14% growth from 2021. This is above the high end of our 10% to 13% long-term average adjusted EPS growth target. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2022 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, as our innovation, market-leading clinical capabilities and proven track record of delivering for clients and customers continue to resonate in the market. Turning specifically to fourth quarter results for Evernorth, revenues grew to $36.2 billion, while pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 6% over fourth quarter 2021 to $1.7 billion. Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, Evernorth's strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by continued expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our specialty pharmacy as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continued to make meaningful strategic investments, which serve to strengthen our client relationships, expand our services portfolio and advance our digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers and expanding our partnerships and relationships, all while achieving strong revenue and pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our recently announced collaboration with Centene that begins in 2024 as well as other large multiyear contracts we renewed for 2023 further demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and proven partnership orientation in the market, providing long-term opportunities to grow while driving lower costs for our clients. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. As we entered 2022, we shared with all of you our goals of both growing our customer base and expanding margins. I'm pleased to report we ended the year accomplishing both of these goals, as we grew our medical customer base by 5% or 923,000 lives to 18 million total customers, while improving full year pre-tax adjusted margins to 9%, a year-over-year improvement of 90 basis points. Fourth quarter 2022 performance contributed to full year results with adjusted revenues of $11.1 billion, pre-tax adjusted earnings of $500 million and a medical care ratio of 84%. Despite an elevated flu and RSV season, our medical care ratio was slightly better than our expectations, particularly within our stop-loss products. Our medical care ratio for full year 2022 of 81.7% improved 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Both full year and fourth quarter results benefited from pricing discipline and affordability initiatives, including our clinical programs. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered for our customers, clients and partners, all while driving a strong year of customer growth and margin expansion with full year pre-tax adjusted earnings growth of 13%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range of 8% to 10%. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $382 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, Cigna's 2022 results were strong, reflecting focused execution for the benefit of our clients and customers. As we turn to 2023, we continue to expect underlying growth in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to make strategic investments to drive future growth. For the full year 2023 outlook, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.33 billion or at least $24.60 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary on our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you this outlook includes a headwind from costs we will incur in 2023 to prepare for serving Centene's customers. This contract starts on January 1, 2024, and we look forward to many years of partnership and collaboration as we drive affordability for their customers.  Additionally, with regards to earnings seasonality, we would expect a different cadence this year when compared to historical patterns, with earnings more back half weighted, in first quarter representing slightly above 20% of the full year EPS. For full year 2023, we project an adjusted SG&A expense ratio of approximately 7.3%. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 21% to 21.5%. I'll now discuss our 2023 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. Tailwinds and headwinds are largely consistent with the points we highlighted on our third quarter earnings call. These include tailwinds from a strong selling season and value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars, building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond. These are partly offset by headwinds from additional costs to support future growth, including implementation costs associated with onboarding Centene prior to receiving revenue, strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses and the expansion of our relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. In consideration of these tailwinds and headwinds, we expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to be weighted more towards the back half of the year, with low single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first half, followed by mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the second half. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.4 billion, representing growth of at least 8% year-over-year. We expect 2023 Cigna Healthcare earnings to be split closer to 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing.  Key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2023 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2023 growth of at least 1.2 million customers, with growth across each of our U.S. Commercial, Medicare Advantage and individual businesses. Within U.S. Commercial, we expect organic customer growth across each of our national, middle market and select market segments. And similar to 2022, the growth will primarily reflect fee-based customers. We expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least high single digits, and we expect growth in our U.S. individual business of at least 300,000 customers, driven by geographic expansion, strong industry growth and the exit of competitors from certain geographies. We expect the 2023 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% in part reflecting an increased mix of government business, which tends to have a higher medical care ratio compared to U.S. Commercial and International Health. Additionally, we would expect the first quarter 2023 medical care ratio to be within the full year guidance range.  As it relates to Corporate and Other Operations, this segment has evolved given the divestiture of a portion of our international business last year that had been a positive earnings contributor in the first half of 2022. As a result, we expect the full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted loss to more closely reflect annualized fourth quarter 2022 results. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. In 2022, we finished the year strong and delivered $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We returned $9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2022. Specific to share buyback, we repurchased 27.4 million shares for $7.6 billion. Additionally, our debt-to-cap ratio finished the year at 40.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points from year-end 2021.  Now, framing our capital outlook for 2023. We expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our enterprise. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures. These investments will include substantial commitments to our accelerated growth platforms of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Care, and U.S. government. We expect to deploy approximately $1.45 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend of $1.23 per share, up 10% from 2022 on a per share basis. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2023, we have repurchased 1.6 million shares for $510 million. And our guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares to be in the range of 296 million to 300 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  And now to recap. Our full year 2022 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2023 outlook reflects continued momentum across our segments as we invest to support long-term attractive growth. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 full year adjusted earnings of at least $24.60 per share. And we continue to expect to deliver 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice : I might ask a little bit more about where you're at in the rollout of the VillageMD value-based contracting arrangements. I know when the deal was signed, contracts had to be signed in the various markets with the VillageMD folks. Have you largely been able to do that? Maybe give us anything you can about how you see that business ramping up in terms of contribution to Evernorth revenue and operating income over time. I assume it will be not particularly material this year, but as you look out over the next few years.\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, A.J., it's David. So first and foremost, stepping back, we're pleased with the relationship and the ability to partner with a proven organization that has a nice growth track record. Two, you think about the work taking place collaboratively in phases, with the first phase of well underway working through and successfully securing approvals and contracts with building momentum, whereby we will put in place with Village, capabilities such that we could enable more targeted access to preferred or higher-performing specialists within the Cigna Healthcare Life portfolio and the direct serve portfolio of our relationships as Phase 1 and expand some of the capabilities to coordinate care, whether it's expansion of virtual capabilities, expansion of behavioral capabilities or otherwise. There's a second phase of work, so the innovation will continue, whereby we work with Village to codify and build some new products that have exclusivity relative to their proven physician leadership and physician-directed programs that have even a more targeted value proposition not just for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare on the benefit side, but offered for the benefit of health plans we serve in a broader sense and for Village. One of the wonderful parts of the way the relationship is built through leveraging the Evernorth capabilities, we'll be building a lot of the shared savings together with Village. And as such, be able to benefit from those shared savings through our Evernorth program.  So to recap, good momentum already, good collaboration already, good progress already. You're right, we don't market as a significant revenue or earnings driver in 2023 for us, but we will see progress in 2023, especially through the second half of the year and a building contributor in 2024, and we look forward to providing you more of an update as we look to 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor : I also wanted to ask about VillageMD. So David, we'll keep you on that track just a little bit longer. My question -- I guess I have a couple of questions about it. One is, I know historically, your inclination was Cigna didn't need to own delivery assets even though your peers are increasingly moving in that direction, and this investment does obviously give you some ownership of a delivery asset. So just wanting to understand how much your thinking has evolved along those lines? And then secondly, I just kind of want to understand a little better long term. Village obviously has this large growth national expansion plan, how do you -- but payer agnostic. So does it really just become a important partner and a part of a preferred primary care network? Or how do we think about the next several years, like what that relationship means to the Cigna Healthcare and to Evernorth?\nDavid Cordani : Sure, Gary. A lot in there. Let me try to address the points, all important points, and I appreciate your question. First and foremost, to be clear, our strategy remains consistent. Our preferred approach on the core medical fulfillment of care is to partner and enable. I'll come back to that. As we've discussed before, there are parts of the healthcare delivery or service fulfillment equation that we seek to own, and we're very clear relative to that. Examples include virtual, behavioral, specialty pharmaceutical fulfillment and select aspects of home care, we deem them to be unique, highly differentiated and an ability to leverage over multiple geographies in an efficient way. Our notion of partnering continues through, we'll call it, core value-based care, where today, about 75% of our MA customers have a value-based care relationship. About 50% of our exchange customers have a value-based care relationship. And about 40% of our commercial employer business has a value-based care relationship. Now to the Village relationship. First and foremost, it's also a clear depiction as we discussed at our Investor Day, that we see the healthcare delivery system community as an addressable market for us. We see it as an addressable market to bring additional services to help to extend their reach, their care coordination, curation of high-performing specialty networks and overall continuity of care, including digital aspects of the care equation. So the Village relationship, we see as an extension of partnering we see that payer agnostic orientation that you articulated as a positive because Evernorth serves a broad portfolio of clients including most of the large health plans in America today in some way, shape or form. And we see the ability to grow collectively and collaboratively with Village as a positive, but through partnering set of relationships. So to reiterate, there are aspects that we'll seek to own. We will continue to use our current process of incentive alignment and care coordination to extend our core value-based care offerings. And now with Evernorth, we will seek to deepen those services with select provider partners for the benefit of the totality of the panel, not just for the Cigna Healthcare lives that go through. However, there may be some unique programs that are designed from a Cigna Healthcare standpoint. So we see this as a great win-win and an additional growth opportunity for Evernorth. Gary, I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : You mentioned some of the headwinds and tailwinds for Evernorth into 2023. And obviously, there's the Centene implementation cost. But you also mentioned some other strategic investments. And can you quantify those? Or what is that exactly? And in the back-end weighting across the segment, is that largely attributable to those associated costs? Or is that a little bit of the HUMIRA benefit has been or changeable comes available midyear?\nBrian Evanko : Erin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the headwinds and tailwinds you're right to call out the strategic investments. So we continue to invest an outsized amount of money in areas such as our Evernorth Care services platform to enable things like VillageMD that David just discussed alongside our specialty pharmacy business, which continues to grow at very attractive rates. And so, that's all been factored in alongside the Centene related implementation costs. But importantly, we have tailwinds that allow us to introduce our guide today with at least 4.5% income growth for the Evernorth segment, inclusive of those pressure points on the spending side. As it relates to the cadence of Evernorth earnings, you should think of the back half weighting that I referenced is primarily driven by the biosimilar ramp effect that I described, but not entirely, there's also some effect of the cadence of operating expense spending over the course of the year that also impacts the timing. But the biosimilar contributions, we do expect to be more back half weighted, which is a key driver of the difference in the cadence.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : I wanted to ask a little bit about the customer growth, that's a pretty strong number there. And so when you think about the enrollment growth, I guess, first on the ACA side, how comfortable are you about the risk profile and the pricing on that type of growth? And then as far as the commercial growth, is there -- I know it's ASOs so it's less risk -- worried about risk there, but just want to understand your thought process around how redeterminations impacted your growth expectations there? Maybe how much of that growth you expect there is in group versus kind of new customer wins?\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, Kevin, it's David. Let me start just frame it a bit more broadly and then ask Brian to peel back your question a little bit. First, we're pleased with the strong performance we delivered in 2022 and now being able to step into 2023 with a very attractive outlook. And it continues to reinforce that our Cigna Healthcare platform, including our Commercial employer portfolio continues to perform very well. I'd just highlight three areas quickly in terms of the underlying drivers or enablers of the continued growth for us. One, especially in the commercial employer portfolio is a consistent intense focus. We have, we are, we will continue to have a consistent intense focus on this segment as we see it as a growth segment. Hence, we focus and innovate for its benefit.  Second is a track record of excellent total cost or total medical costs. That is resulting from very good work from our network management team our clinical programs and the returns they deliver and our growing suite of site of care optimization programs that all contribute to good clinical quality service and overall affordability.  And then finally, what we've talked about before, but maybe it's sometimes forgotten, our orientation around consultation and putting solutions in place. So whether it's an employer of 100 or an employer of 10,000, we take an orientation of consultatively working to put the right solution suite in place for them. I'm going to have Brian peel back the drivers of our outlook, I will put one asterisk on it. We have not factored in an uptake relative to redeterminations as a contributor in our outlook for the year. We recognize that redeterminations present an opportunity for us, not a risk for us because we don't have that business to protect currently. But given it's still uncertain in terms of the rate and pace of state activity to adjudicate their redeterminations, we don't have that factored into this very attractive outlook. Of course, we'll present updates to you as the year unfolds as states go through the redetermination process. I'll ask Brian to unpack the drivers of our membership growth a little further.\nBrian Evanko : Sure, David. Good morning, Kevin. So maybe just a little bit more detail here in terms of how to think about the 1.2 million plus net customer growth. And then I'll hit your question on the ACA exchange profitability as well. So first off, I'd be remiss if I didn't say we're really pleased with another year of strong growth that we expect here in 2023 and following growing almost 1 million net customers or 5% in 2022. And as we mentioned earlier, we expect net growth in 2023 across all of our major U.S. business segments with the individual exchange business expecting at least 300,000 net customer growth. Our MA net growth has started strong. We expect at least a high single-digit percentage growth rate for 2023, in line or better than industry growth rates. And we expect at least 250,000 net new customers generated by core growth across our U.S. Commercial portfolio. So if you take those three components together, they represent about half of our expected full year net growth of 1.2 million plus customers. And then the balance of the 2023 customer growth, you can think of as the net effect of some moving pieces, including the larger client relationship expansion that David mentioned in his prepared remarks. I mean we have good line of sight into this 1.2 million plus to David's point, we are not banking on any meaningful amount of volume for Medicaid redeterminations. As it relates to the morbidity and/or risk pool of the IFP business or individual business that we're adding, our 2023 customer growth outlook reflects a combination of a few things being industry growth our own new market entry as well as competitors exiting certain geographies that we participate in. As you think about where our margin profile stands, in 2022, the margins on this book are below our long-term goal. Our long-term goal is to remind you is 4% to 6%. We took a step forward in '22 from where we were in '21, given that '21 was a depressed margin year. But we're still below our long-term goal. And for purposes of '23, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our 4% to 6% long-term goal in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. Just given the substantial amount of new customers we've added, we thought it was prudent to assume margins will be below our long-term target for this calendar year. But this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help to contribute toward the long-term growth in the Cigna Healthcare segment income\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : I guess you guys get the first crack to comment on the preliminary 2024 MA rates and just interested in your initial observations on those. Obviously, we sell the final rates ahead and whether that influences your thoughts on your 10% to 15% long-term Medicare Advantage enrollment growth target at all, max?\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, Scott. Clearly, the initial or preliminary rate letter came out. But before I comment on that, just stepping back for a moment, it's clear that Medicare Advantage has represented and continues to represent a significant both market opportunity as well as a growth opportunity for the U.S. today serving about 30 million seniors continued growth and seniors reinforce the value, the clinical quality and the service quality they receive by continuing to renew and/or expand relationships in MA. The initial rate letter that came out does have lower or somewhat anemic revenue, we'll await the final rate letter that comes forward relative to that. Having said that, I think it's a little bit early to presuppose what 2024 growth outlook may look like because you compete on a relative basis. Having said that, this will create, if it stays in the range of what the rate letter looks like. It will create some revenue dislocation. So the sophistication of benefit management that's going to be necessary market by market. The leverage of value-based care relationships, which, as I noted earlier, about 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based care relationship will all come into play.  I reinforce the fact that the 10% to 15% is our objective to have 10% to 15% customer growth over time on average. We're stepping into this year with a very good customer growth outlook already that we feel good about. And as a final note, I would remind you that while an attractive long-term growth opportunity for us, today, this represents or MA represents less than 5% of the enterprise portfolio. So any dislocation in 2024, we deem to be manageable with the strong performing portfolio that we have in front of us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Just want to follow up first on the membership guide. Just any color on the pricing of that membership, how much comes in Q1 versus the rest of the year? And then healthcare margins certainly been a lot better there in 2022. Just wondering what ballpark you're expecting to be in 2023 there relative to your long-term guidance?\nDavid Cordani : Justin, a little color relative to pacing and then I'll ask Brian to talk about more to your second question. As Brian noted, we have good visibility into the membership volume. And when you think about the -- outside of the individual exchange business, what we've seen growth across all of our funding types. Still the lion's share of it is ASO including the service-based relationship with a large customer. So in essence, a meaningful portion of that volume will be realized in the first quarter of 2023, and then they'll be puts and takes throughout the course of the year. We'll look forward to providing you updates on. Now individual lines of business will move throughout the course of the year. But by and large, if you think about -- our expectation is that we'll have good performance relative to that on the first quarter of the year and then some puts and takes throughout the course of the year with some additional growth and maybe some additional disenrollment as we factored in some impact in our outlook for a bit of an uptick in disenrollment as we look at the current fragility of the U.S. economy. So good visibility for Q1. I'll ask Brian to talk a bit more around the margin.\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Justin. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare margin profile, we're first off, really pleased to have finished 2022 with the 9% Cigna Healthcare margin, which is 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion which allowed us to return to the low end of our target margin range of 9% to 10%. So this stronger-than-expected 2022 performance certainly increases our confidence in executing against our '23 margin goals. As I noted in my prepared comments earlier, we will see some product mix shift in 2023, specifically with the government lines becoming a slightly larger percent of premium within Cigna Healthcare, and these products tend to carry a lower profit margin profile than the U.S. Commercial and International Health products. So when you consider all of this and our continued investments in our accelerated growth platforms such as MA, we'd expect our 2023 Cigna Healthcare margins to land within our target 9% to 10% range, but at the low end.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : I just wanted to come back to the PBM. David, you made a comment that HUMIRA would be on the formulary and parity with the biosimilar. Just curious as we think about AbbVie potentially increasing the rebates around that product? Is it better for the PBM if it shifts to the biosimilar? Or are contracts now set up in a way that you're going to share in the overall cost savings where it doesn't really matter. And then secondly, when we think about plan design, anything of note when we think about pharmacy benefit for 2023?\nDavid Cordani : Lisa, good morning. So to your first question, the co-preferred position that we have taken on our national preferred formulary is a mechanism to aid the transition, preserve and expand choice with aligned economics back to our clients and for the benefit of our customers and patients. I'd also note that that's our National Preferred Formulary, which is our largest single formulary. We support and administer multiple formularies that are customized for individual clients from that standpoint and avail choice. I'd also suggest that this will be fluid. It will flex over time. Third, as we've demonstrated within our PBM and our broad pharmacy portfolio services, we have the tools to align the incentives whereby when we enable choice and create value. Meaningful portion of that value are passed back to clients, customers and patients and a sustainable portion of the value is retained by us and the current position that we have taken aligns in that way. So it's not -- we have to have a reason of our brand drug versus the biosimilar, we have the mechanisms to afford additional choice, additional flexibility and to align the incentives. As it relates to the second part of your question, I would just give you by way of trend as opposed to an individual benefit design configuration or change, buyers in the space, be they corporate buyers, health plan buyers, et cetera, are seeking to push for more what we talk about internally all the time, coordination of services and continue to challenge point solutions. That plays very well for us. So when you think about an illustration of that, the Pathwell program around biosimilars, the Pathwell programs around biologics, the Pathwell programs around injectables is a way to further coordinate services with precision or a subset of patients and deliver more value from that standpoint, you have to harness data, you have to harness clinical capabilities, you have to harness digital capabilities. You have to harness network and benefit management capabilities. And again, the combined organization is well positioned for that. So I would say more precision in benefit programs on a go-forward basis that bring more targeted coordination, harnessing data and harnessing specific sub-segments. And again, we are well positioned for that and Pathwell is an illustration of that direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin : I want to go back to Village and the partnership there. And I'm just trying to think about how Village and Cigna Healthcare work together and sort of how you have impact on their strategy? And are there targeted growth strategies in markets that may be stronger than, say, your MA book? And then, Dave, I think you said 75% of the Medicare Advantage business is in some sort of value-based care. How much of that is actually full risk or full capitation relationships?\nDavid Cordani : Josh, good morning, good to chat with you this morning. So let me take your second question first. In aggregate, a small proportion is in full cap. As we've discussed before, our preferred approach typically has a shared risk relationship. Some of it is in global cap for sure, but a minority of it is in global cap, a majority of it is in a shared risk, longstanding shared risk program. And then another minority would be an upside only P4P in terms of new relationship pay-for-performance. So if you think about it in terms of a suite of capabilities, our sweet spot and our preferred approach is a shared alignment program, not a global cap program, but we have some global cap. To the first part of your question, you came back to the Village and CHE side of the equation. So I'd ask you to think about, first and foremost, the relationship with Village that was built out and expanded is an Evernorth relationship. That's not to take away from CHE, I'll come to the core of your question in a moment. And that relationship, as I discussed with a previous question, is around helping to broaden and target the reach, broaden the reach and then target with precision around subspecialty and then coordinate services in an even more precise way off of their already highly performing value proposition. Now that will be benefited to Cigna Healthcare, but also other health lands and broadly speaking, Village's patient panel over time.  Now specific to Cigna Healthcare, this relationship presents the opportunity to design certain benefit alternatives or unique product alternatives in collaboration with Village because of our closer relationship. That will evolve over time, and those conversations are manifesting themselves already. And the positive there is that that's building off of an already positive relationship. So back to the main course here is an Evernorth\u2019s relationship and further evolving their already strong performance in terms of reach, precision for the breadth of the panel. Cigna Healthcare will benefit from that. It presents the opportunity in targeted geographies and to bring specific benefit alternatives forward for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare and all that is on the docket relative to co-collaboration right now. That's why we're so excited about the partnership with Village.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Nick on for Steve. I wanted to ask about the in-group trends you're seeing in Commercial, given the number of different data points we're getting on the labor market. I know the last time you guys spoke about it, you said that while you were starting to feel some of the headlines manifest employers were generally still in net hiring mode. I wanted to see if that was still the case and if there was anything to call out between select, middle market and national?\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, Nick, it's David. I'll just give you a little directional indicator here. So throughout 2022, broadly speaking, we saw the kind of net effect of hiring still the lead dimension in terms of playing through. Although as we've talked quarter-to-quarter throughout the course of 2022, we recognized there was a softening in the economy. As we get through the latter part of the year and the end of the year, that pretty much muted down and approximates canceling itself off. So the net hiring versus the net disenrollment moved to a slight negative. As I mentioned in a prior comment, our projection for 2023 assumes a further uptick or a further softening of disenrollment as we look at the economy, we don't -- within our book as we go case by case and relationship by relationship, we don't see large dislocations, but we think it's prudent to plan for some further softening throughout the course of the year, and that's fully factored in to our projection. I wouldn't call out one individual sub-segment. The National Press would say that small employers are continuing to hire in terms of fight to get to full levels of employment. So we can see some indicators relative to that. But broadly speaking, I would suggest you to think about -- we believe we've taken a prudent outlook in our full year membership outlook by further dampening the additional enrollment throughout the course of the year, and we think that's an appropriate approach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : So just back on Evernorth again, within that context of the earnings growth being more back half weighted and faster growth in the back half. Just if you can remind us again how you're thinking about the cadence of recognition of the Centene PBM onboarding costs between the first half versus the second half? I'm wondering if that's still kind of fluid for you guys is how that might flow during the year? Or is that kind of set in stone as far as the weighting of that expense in the first half versus the second half?\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Steve, it's Brian. So as it relates to the Centene related implementation costs in 2023, we do expect there to be an uptick over the course of the year in that spending. So you can think of it as growing from the first quarter through the fourth quarter modestly. So as you think about the total spend. So we've incurred a small fraction of the total we expect to spend over the course of the full year. But importantly, which if you think about that mathematically, it goes against the concept of back half income weighting. The magnitude of that is far outweighed by the other factors that I referenced earlier in terms of the contribution from biosimilars ramping in the back half as well as the other SG&A patterns that will emerge over the course of the year. But you should think of the Centene related costs for the course of the year and a small fraction of that already spent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : I wanted to follow up on the biosimilar ramp and how you're approaching formulary changes this year and going forward. I guess specifically to the negotiations manufacturers. Is that something that we should think about happening once per year on an annual basis does the entry of additional biosimilars give you the opportunity to go back to all manufacturers and negotiate additional savings? And then could you also talk about how you and your clients are thinking about the extent you want to drive patients to the lowest-cost product versus kind of maintaining choice and kind of access to different therapies?\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, Nate, it's David. You should think about, broadly speaking, the formulated decisions are made in the latter part of the calendar year, so deep into Q4 of a given year for the next year with the best insights; two, there's always some fluidity relative to drug launches that manifest themselves throughout the course of the year. In the case of biosimilars, we know there are drug launches expected in the Q3 timeframe of this year, of 2023, that we've fully contemplated and factored in. And we have the ability to flex formularies in the course of the year with individual clients, individual health plans, et cetera, obviously, on a consultative fashion. So view the decisions are largely made in advance of the year. However, you have the flexibility to go back and make adjustments my comments are not specific to your specific question around manufacturer-specific contracts through that lens. To the latter part of your question, by and large, employers, health plans, et cetera, are focused on clinical efficacy and comparative effectiveness. So the fixation relative to first and foremost as it should be clinical efficacy, making sure when there's any alternative that's available in turning the best external validation of the clinical equivalent of the impact of a pharmaceutical is evaluated properly and then comparative effectiveness, looking at the economics and then getting to a total low cost of care or best value equation. And then the employer or health line may make some trade-offs in terms of which levers they want to use to achieve that, but ultimately, it comes down to the best total cost equation once the clinical efficacy hurdle is crossed. And as I mentioned in the prior question, we have the tools, we have the services, we have the flexibility to avail employer by employer, health plan by health plan to be able to get them to the right balance that they want. But ultimately, it's the low total cost equation with the clinical outcomes that are preferred from that standpoint that drive the net conversations and the net decisions by employers and by health plans.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Just wanted to follow up, David, on the comments you made on the VillageMD relationship, which was really helpful to kind of frame that. And what I was trying to understand is from the Evernorth side, it would seem that Evernorth could be a distribution partner wherever Evernorth could be helping Village to enable itself to better manage costs, either through providing MD live or networks or Evernorth PBM services, et cetera. So maybe a little more color on sort of what is the primary role that Evernorth is playing there? And then just secondarily, for the MCO, how important and what is the opportunity for in addition to new product design for you to cross-sell in your ASO block, the VillageMD sort of value-based care source of services?\nDavid Cordani : Good morning, Lance. So I think your framework is quite helpful. If you think about the building blocks you articulated, you laid them out quite nicely. I just would play with the order a little bit. Job one for us with Village is to work in partnership, right? It's not to push a product. It's a work in partnership to avail additional capabilities off their already strong performing platforms to further improve affordability or clinical quality. So let's take an example. Take the opportunity to curate in an individual market or submarket for larger markets, the highest-performing oncology providers for certain tumor types or certain diagnoses. Our longitudinal datasets enable that in a very differentiated way, be able to bring a bit more precision. The net result of that is, therefore, for a Village patient, a higher probability of getting the best possible evidence-based care and coordinated care and therefore, best overall value. Of which then Village benefits from that. The patient obviously benefits from that. And what we've designed is the Evernorth enablement benefits from that.  Point two is you want to distribution. We could bring more access in volume flow through the high-performing opportunities that exist here. There's no doubt around that, and we will seek to do so. And then third, where you came back to, we will absolutely help to enable these capabilities back, which is a subset of your distribution in a way back to our large well-performing portfolio of ASO clients by bringing yet even more precision of care coordination for their benefit. But in this case, we have through the Evernorth services and through the collaboration with Village, the ability to be rewarded in addition to the value we would be creating for their benefit. So there's multiple building blocks here, which is why we're quite excited. At the end of the day, if you put a big circle around it, Lance, it all comes down to how do we harness more data how do we harness more clinical coordination to bring even greater clinical quality and overall affordability, one patient at a time with a platform that is performing well, that is Village and then creating extenders and some care coordination that comes along with it. And through Evernorth, we have both the service mechanism and then the sharing mechanism built that will work in conjunction with Village for.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley : Scott asked the rates questions. It's been a couple of more days since the RADV rule. I thought I'd ask you, David, to provide your thoughts on RADV and navigating through that in addition to a tighter rate environment for next year?\nDavid Cordani : Sure. Good morning, Dave. So relative to RADV and the new information that came out, first and foremost, we deem that risk adjusters are and remain an important tool for the program. And as I noted before, a program that has worked obviously for quite some time for the benefit of seniors and delivering excellent clinical quality, value and service. Additionally, from a Cigna perspective, we remain committed to executing, obviously, this program in a highly compliant fashion.  Now specific to the RADV actions, we're pleased, the CMS concluded that they're not going to extrapolate their actions prior to 2018. We're concerned that we continue to question a couple of decisions. For example, the elimination of the fee-for-service adjuster that we deemed to be foundational to the program. And we await specifics relative to the methodology that is going to be used in some aspects of the extrapolation and work as we have in the past and as we always will, we will work closely with CMS to seek to get further clarity relative to the open items that are here.  So a bit of a fluid environment but we see progress relative to the lack of extrapolation beyond 2018, and we see some open questions for the industry at large that still remain, and we will collaborate with CMS to get more visibility on that over the near term.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani : Thank you. Just to briefly recap, 2022 was a strong year of performance, growth and positive impact that our company brought forward. With Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we demonstrated that we are serving the current needs of our customers, clients and partners, and we expect to deliver another year of customer and earnings growth in 2023. I want to recognize and more importantly, thank more than 70,000 co-workers around the world. It's ultimately their continued dedication and leadership that allows us to make a defining difference in healthcare and their demonstrated commitment to building on the momentum we've delivered to have a larger impact as we look to the future as we strive to improve the health and vitality that of those we're privileged to serve. With that, we thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to our continued conversations as we go forward. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, and I'll provide our outlook for 2023. We're very pleased with our strong performance in 2022, reflecting focused execution and growth across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, with each segment achieving pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line or above our long-term targets. This positions us well for continued growth in 2023.  Looking at full year 2022 specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of approximately $181 billion, and adjusted earnings of $7.3 billion after tax or $23.27 per share, reflecting 14% growth from 2021. This is above the high end of our 10% to 13% long-term average adjusted EPS growth target. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2022 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth, as our innovation, market-leading clinical capabilities and proven track record of delivering for clients and customers continue to resonate in the market. Turning specifically to fourth quarter results for Evernorth, revenues grew to $36.2 billion, while pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 6% over fourth quarter 2021 to $1.7 billion. Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, Evernorth's strong results in the fourth quarter were driven by continued expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our specialty pharmacy as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continued to make meaningful strategic investments, which serve to strengthen our client relationships, expand our services portfolio and advance our digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another strong year, focusing on driving value for clients and customers and expanding our partnerships and relationships, all while achieving strong revenue and pre-tax adjusted earnings growth in line with our long-term growth targets. Our recently announced collaboration with Centene that begins in 2024 as well as other large multiyear contracts we renewed for 2023 further demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and proven partnership orientation in the market, providing long-term opportunities to grow while driving lower costs for our clients. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. As we entered 2022, we shared with all of you our goals of both growing our customer base and expanding margins. I'm pleased to report we ended the year accomplishing both of these goals, as we grew our medical customer base by 5% or 923,000 lives to 18 million total customers, while improving full year pre-tax adjusted margins to 9%, a year-over-year improvement of 90 basis points. Fourth quarter 2022 performance contributed to full year results with adjusted revenues of $11.1 billion, pre-tax adjusted earnings of $500 million and a medical care ratio of 84%. Despite an elevated flu and RSV season, our medical care ratio was slightly better than our expectations, particularly within our stop-loss products. Our medical care ratio for full year 2022 of 81.7% improved 230 basis points compared to the prior year. Both full year and fourth quarter results benefited from pricing discipline and affordability initiatives, including our clinical programs. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered for our customers, clients and partners, all while driving a strong year of customer growth and margin expansion with full year pre-tax adjusted earnings growth of 13%, which is above the high end of our long-term target range of 8% to 10%. Turning to Corporate and Other Operations. The fourth quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $382 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, Cigna's 2022 results were strong, reflecting focused execution for the benefit of our clients and customers. As we turn to 2023, we continue to expect underlying growth in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, while continuing to make strategic investments to drive future growth. For the full year 2023 outlook, we expect consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $187 billion. We expect full year consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $7.33 billion or at least $24.60 per share, consistent with our prior EPS commentary on our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you this outlook includes a headwind from costs we will incur in 2023 to prepare for serving Centene's customers. This contract starts on January 1, 2024, and we look forward to many years of partnership and collaboration as we drive affordability for their customers.  Additionally, with regards to earnings seasonality, we would expect a different cadence this year when compared to historical patterns, with earnings more back half weighted, in first quarter representing slightly above 20% of the full year EPS. For full year 2023, we project an adjusted SG&A expense ratio of approximately 7.3%. And we expect a consolidated adjusted tax rate in the range of 21% to 21.5%. I'll now discuss our 2023 outlook for our segments. For Evernorth, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. Tailwinds and headwinds are largely consistent with the points we highlighted on our third quarter earnings call. These include tailwinds from a strong selling season and value creation from the increased availability of biosimilars, building in the second half of 2023 and ramping in 2024 and beyond. These are partly offset by headwinds from additional costs to support future growth, including implementation costs associated with onboarding Centene prior to receiving revenue, strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses and the expansion of our relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. In consideration of these tailwinds and headwinds, we expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to be weighted more towards the back half of the year, with low single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the first half, followed by mid-to-high single-digit year-over-year earnings growth in the second half. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.4 billion, representing growth of at least 8% year-over-year. We expect 2023 Cigna Healthcare earnings to be split closer to 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. This outlook reflects the strength of our value proposition and focused execution in our business driven by organic customer growth and disciplined pricing.  Key assumptions reflected in our Cigna Healthcare earnings outlook for 2023 include the following: regarding total medical customers, we expect 2023 growth of at least 1.2 million customers, with growth across each of our U.S. Commercial, Medicare Advantage and individual businesses. Within U.S. Commercial, we expect organic customer growth across each of our national, middle market and select market segments. And similar to 2022, the growth will primarily reflect fee-based customers. We expect Medicare Advantage customer growth of at least high single digits, and we expect growth in our U.S. individual business of at least 300,000 customers, driven by geographic expansion, strong industry growth and the exit of competitors from certain geographies. We expect the 2023 medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.5% in part reflecting an increased mix of government business, which tends to have a higher medical care ratio compared to U.S. Commercial and International Health. Additionally, we would expect the first quarter 2023 medical care ratio to be within the full year guidance range.  As it relates to Corporate and Other Operations, this segment has evolved given the divestiture of a portion of our international business last year that had been a positive earnings contributor in the first half of 2022. As a result, we expect the full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted loss to more closely reflect annualized fourth quarter 2022 results. Now moving to our capital management position and outlook. In 2022, we finished the year strong and delivered $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations. We returned $9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends in 2022. Specific to share buyback, we repurchased 27.4 million shares for $7.6 billion. Additionally, our debt-to-cap ratio finished the year at 40.9%, an improvement of 80 basis points from year-end 2021.  Now, framing our capital outlook for 2023. We expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations, reflecting the strong capital efficiency of our enterprise. This positions us well to continue creating value through accretive capital deployment in line with our strategy and priorities. We expect to deploy approximately $1.4 billion to capital expenditures. These investments will include substantial commitments to our accelerated growth platforms of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Care, and U.S. government. We expect to deploy approximately $1.45 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our increased quarterly dividend of $1.23 per share, up 10% from 2022 on a per share basis. Year-to-date, as of February 2, 2023, we have repurchased 1.6 million shares for $510 million. And our guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares to be in the range of 296 million to 300 million shares. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  And now to recap. Our full year 2022 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2023 outlook reflects continued momentum across our segments as we invest to support long-term attractive growth. We are confident in our ability to deliver our 2023 full year adjusted earnings of at least $24.60 per share. And we continue to expect to deliver 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28, consistent with our prior EPS commentary. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Erin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the headwinds and tailwinds you're right to call out the strategic investments. So we continue to invest an outsized amount of money in areas such as our Evernorth Care services platform to enable things like VillageMD that David just discussed alongside our specialty pharmacy business, which continues to grow at very attractive rates. And so, that's all been factored in alongside the Centene related implementation costs. But importantly, we have tailwinds that allow us to introduce our guide today with at least 4.5% income growth for the Evernorth segment, inclusive of those pressure points on the spending side. As it relates to the cadence of Evernorth earnings, you should think of the back half weighting that I referenced is primarily driven by the biosimilar ramp effect that I described, but not entirely, there's also some effect of the cadence of operating expense spending over the course of the year that also impacts the timing. But the biosimilar contributions, we do expect to be more back half weighted, which is a key driver of the difference in the cadence. Sure, David. Good morning, Kevin. So maybe just a little bit more detail here in terms of how to think about the 1.2 million plus net customer growth. And then I'll hit your question on the ACA exchange profitability as well. So first off, I'd be remiss if I didn't say we're really pleased with another year of strong growth that we expect here in 2023 and following growing almost 1 million net customers or 5% in 2022. And as we mentioned earlier, we expect net growth in 2023 across all of our major U.S. business segments with the individual exchange business expecting at least 300,000 net customer growth. Our MA net growth has started strong. We expect at least a high single-digit percentage growth rate for 2023, in line or better than industry growth rates. And we expect at least 250,000 net new customers generated by core growth across our U.S. Commercial portfolio. So if you take those three components together, they represent about half of our expected full year net growth of 1.2 million plus customers. And then the balance of the 2023 customer growth, you can think of as the net effect of some moving pieces, including the larger client relationship expansion that David mentioned in his prepared remarks. I mean we have good line of sight into this 1.2 million plus to David's point, we are not banking on any meaningful amount of volume for Medicaid redeterminations. As it relates to the morbidity and/or risk pool of the IFP business or individual business that we're adding, our 2023 customer growth outlook reflects a combination of a few things being industry growth our own new market entry as well as competitors exiting certain geographies that we participate in. As you think about where our margin profile stands, in 2022, the margins on this book are below our long-term goal. Our long-term goal is to remind you is 4% to 6%. We took a step forward in '22 from where we were in '21, given that '21 was a depressed margin year. But we're still below our long-term goal. And for purposes of '23, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our 4% to 6% long-term goal in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. Just given the substantial amount of new customers we've added, we thought it was prudent to assume margins will be below our long-term target for this calendar year. But this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help to contribute toward the long-term growth in the Cigna Healthcare segment income Good morning, Justin. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare margin profile, we're first off, really pleased to have finished 2022 with the 9% Cigna Healthcare margin, which is 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion which allowed us to return to the low end of our target margin range of 9% to 10%. So this stronger-than-expected 2022 performance certainly increases our confidence in executing against our '23 margin goals. As I noted in my prepared comments earlier, we will see some product mix shift in 2023, specifically with the government lines becoming a slightly larger percent of premium within Cigna Healthcare, and these products tend to carry a lower profit margin profile than the U.S. Commercial and International Health products. So when you consider all of this and our continued investments in our accelerated growth platforms such as MA, we'd expect our 2023 Cigna Healthcare margins to land within our target 9% to 10% range, but at the low end. Good morning, Steve, it's Brian. So as it relates to the Centene related implementation costs in 2023, we do expect there to be an uptick over the course of the year in that spending. So you can think of it as growing from the first quarter through the fourth quarter modestly. So as you think about the total spend. So we've incurred a small fraction of the total we expect to spend over the course of the full year. But importantly, which if you think about that mathematically, it goes against the concept of back half income weighting. The magnitude of that is far outweighed by the other factors that I referenced earlier in terms of the contribution from biosimilars ramping in the back half as well as the other SG&A patterns that will emerge over the course of the year. But you should think of the Centene related costs for the course of the year and a small fraction of that already spent."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. 2022 was a pivotal year of performance and growth for our company. Evernorth further expanded its health service reach and impact, and Cigna Healthcare demonstrated tremendous resilience in the dynamic market. Together, the breadth and complementary nature of our portfolio enabled us to exceed our revenue and earnings outlook and return meaningful capital to our shareholders. This provides us with momentum as we begin 2023 and we expect another year of customer and earnings growth as we innovate and expand our broad portfolio of services and capabilities. Today, I'll provide perspective about our key drivers for our 2022 performance and how we're positioned for sustained growth going forward. Then Brian will walk through additional details about our 2022 financial results and discuss our '23 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. So let's jump in. As we reflect on our performance for 2022, I'm proud of what the company and Cigna team delivered overall. We grew full year revenues to approximately $181 billion. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $23.27 reflecting a 14% rate of growth. We returned $9 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchase and dividends, and we sharpened the health service focus of our international business through the divestiture of our life accident and supplemental benefits businesses across seven markets. This performance demonstrates how well our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms are strategically positioned for sustained attractive growth.  In 2022, Evernorth delivered strong top and bottom line growth and also won, renewed and expanded several large multiyear client relationships for 2023 and beyond. The depth of Evernorth's capabilities and expertise is highly valued by our clients and partners and enables us to deepen existing relationships across our entire portfolio of businesses. Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform also had a strong year, delivering customer growth along with differentiated medical cost performance for the benefit of our customers and clients. Our U.S. Commercial business had a standout performance achieving outsized customer growth while maintaining pricing discipline and driving margin improvement. This reflects our ability of our Commercial team to work consultatively to help employers of all sizes manage affordability, all while we support healthy, highly engaged employees for the benefit of their businesses. Overall, we're pleased with the strength of our 2022 performance across our enterprise. As we look to 2023, we continue to deliver and capture meaningful value in multiple ways. First, we expect sustained growth through our foundational businesses, Pharmacy Benefit Services, U.S. Commercial and International Health. These are mature scaled businesses that have established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental agencies. The value proposition for these businesses continues to resonate very well in the marketplace.  In Pharmacy Benefit Services, we expect continued contributions in 2023 through the strength of our unique solutions and partnership orientation. With the strong selling season across our employer, health plan and governmental agency portfolio, we will continue delivering greater affordability to more customers and patients. Additionally, we are investing meaningfully to put in place the teams and resources to make prescriptions more accessible and affordable for approximately 20 million Centene customers starting in 2024. In the U.S. Commercial business, we also had a strong 2023 selling season across all our market segments and across all funding types, self-funded risk and shared return arrangements. As a result, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth.  And in International Health, we expect continued revenue and earnings contributions through our leadership in meeting the health and wellbeing needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile. Second, we expect outsized growth from our accelerated businesses, Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and U.S. government. These businesses have differentiated capabilities and platforms addressing accelerated secular growth trends. With Accredo, we were able to lower cost for patients and plans while preserving choice and flexibility for those who could benefit from new drugs. This includes our work to increase the availability of biosimilars. We've seen a handful of these lower-cost alternatives for biologic drugs launched in the past few years and understand the exceptional value they deliver for the benefit of clients and customers. 2023 will mark the start of a growing market opportunity for biosimilars, a trend that we expect to continue ramping up in 2024 and beyond. This includes HUMIRA, a treatment for a range of inflammatory conditions and one of the top-selling drugs globally over the past decade. Now there's a biosimilar alternative that we've co-preferred on a national preferred formulary creating significant savings opportunities for clients and customers. We will continue our leadership in advocating for greater availability of biosimilars, which over time, we expect to drive even more savings and benefit for patients and clients. In Evernorth Care Services, we are continuing to enhance and expand our portfolio of capabilities in care management and care delivery. Last year, MDLIVE virtual patient visits grew meaningfully, including a substantial increase in primary care visits. Demand and satisfaction with virtual care is rising and we will continue expanding our MDLIVE platform to provide even more of these options for the benefit of our customers. Evernorth Care Services is also accelerating our value-based care capabilities through our recently announced partnership with VillageMD. Our wrapping Evernorth health service capabilities with VillageMD's network of physicians, we will help guide more patients to high-quality care experiences at lower overall total costs. We expect this partnership to begin rolling out over the course of this year. In the U.S. government, another accelerated business, we expect strong growth in 2023 as we expand services and our geographic presence across a large and growing addressable market. This includes Medicare Advantage, where we will introduce enhanced services and benefits, and we nearly doubled the size of our provider network over the last two years as we expand into new geographies. Additionally, as we have demonstrated continued consistent commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, in a dynamic environment, our Individual & Family Plan business, we will see outsized customer growth in 2023. The third growth driver for us in 2023 and beyond is enterprise leverage. This is where our businesses work together to create or capture more value than anyone could achieve on their own. Here, think about our ability to look across our enterprise and client relationships to broaden and deepen them by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities. A great example is a new large service-based relationship for Cigna Healthcare where we were able to expand our support for a long-served Evernorth client. Additionally, the depth of clinical expertise success in advancing innovation and breadth of solutions within Evernorth, all combined to help further improve Cigna Healthcare's value proposition. For example, in 2022, by harnessing Evernorth's capabilities and programs, Cigna Healthcare delivered exceptional affordability, a key reason it continues to be competitively attractive option for employers of all sizes. This ability to deliver meaningful value is what makes Evernorth a partner of choice to a wide range of health plans, large employers and other clients. Another way we generate enterprise leverage is with our longitudinal portfolio data, which enables us to accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. This is specifically how we developed our Pathwell programs where we're able to integrate Cigna Healthcare's high-performing provider networks and benefits management with Evernorth's analytical and clinical expertise as well as personalized digital support. This equips Pathwell to lower cost while connecting patients with the right care, anticipating their future needs and helping them recover more quickly. Pathwell's focus in 2023 includes musculoskeletal conditions and patients who take injectable or infusible biologic drugs. Early feedback here has been very positive, and we expect to support millions of patients throughout these programs with better experience, clinical quality, costs, resulting in improved overall value. These examples illustrate just some of the impact we've already achieved with our cross-enterprise leverage, and we'll continue acting on additional opportunities in the years ahead to expand relationships, accelerate innovation for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. Now I'll briefly summarize. 2022 was a strong year of performance and growth for our company. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, and our durable growth framework, we are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers, clients and partners as we look to the future. We are delivering on our commitments to our shareholders with our 2022 adjusted EPS of $23.27 and returning $9 billion in share repurchase and dividends. And we are also responding to evolving needs of those we serve in the coming years in the Healthcare environment of accelerated change. We have a differentiated innovation pipeline that will allow us to build on our momentum and create value, continue to advance our growth strategy. We are confident 2023 will be another year of strong performance for our company as we expect to deliver customer and earnings growth. Our EPS outlook of at least $24.60 and the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend reinforced our commitment to sustained impact and growth for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Good morning, A.J., it's David. So first and foremost, stepping back, we're pleased with the relationship and the ability to partner with a proven organization that has a nice growth track record. Two, you think about the work taking place collaboratively in phases, with the first phase of well underway working through and successfully securing approvals and contracts with building momentum, whereby we will put in place with Village, capabilities such that we could enable more targeted access to preferred or higher-performing specialists within the Cigna Healthcare Life portfolio and the direct serve portfolio of our relationships as Phase 1 and expand some of the capabilities to coordinate care, whether it's expansion of virtual capabilities, expansion of behavioral capabilities or otherwise. There's a second phase of work, so the innovation will continue, whereby we work with Village to codify and build some new products that have exclusivity relative to their proven physician leadership and physician-directed programs that have even a more targeted value proposition not just for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare on the benefit side, but offered for the benefit of health plans we serve in a broader sense and for Village. One of the wonderful parts of the way the relationship is built through leveraging the Evernorth capabilities, we'll be building a lot of the shared savings together with Village. And as such, be able to benefit from those shared savings through our Evernorth program.  So to recap, good momentum already, good collaboration already, good progress already. You're right, we don't market as a significant revenue or earnings driver in 2023 for us, but we will see progress in 2023, especially through the second half of the year and a building contributor in 2024, and we look forward to providing you more of an update as we look to 2024. Sure, Gary. A lot in there. Let me try to address the points, all important points, and I appreciate your question. First and foremost, to be clear, our strategy remains consistent. Our preferred approach on the core medical fulfillment of care is to partner and enable. I'll come back to that. As we've discussed before, there are parts of the healthcare delivery or service fulfillment equation that we seek to own, and we're very clear relative to that. Examples include virtual, behavioral, specialty pharmaceutical fulfillment and select aspects of home care, we deem them to be unique, highly differentiated and an ability to leverage over multiple geographies in an efficient way. Our notion of partnering continues through, we'll call it, core value-based care, where today, about 75% of our MA customers have a value-based care relationship. About 50% of our exchange customers have a value-based care relationship. And about 40% of our commercial employer business has a value-based care relationship. Now to the Village relationship. First and foremost, it's also a clear depiction as we discussed at our Investor Day, that we see the healthcare delivery system community as an addressable market for us. We see it as an addressable market to bring additional services to help to extend their reach, their care coordination, curation of high-performing specialty networks and overall continuity of care, including digital aspects of the care equation. So the Village relationship, we see as an extension of partnering we see that payer agnostic orientation that you articulated as a positive because Evernorth serves a broad portfolio of clients including most of the large health plans in America today in some way, shape or form. And we see the ability to grow collectively and collaboratively with Village as a positive, but through partnering set of relationships. So to reiterate, there are aspects that we'll seek to own. We will continue to use our current process of incentive alignment and care coordination to extend our core value-based care offerings. And now with Evernorth, we will seek to deepen those services with select provider partners for the benefit of the totality of the panel, not just for the Cigna Healthcare lives that go through. However, there may be some unique programs that are designed from a Cigna Healthcare standpoint. So we see this as a great win-win and an additional growth opportunity for Evernorth. Gary, I hope that helps. Good morning, Kevin, it's David. Let me start just frame it a bit more broadly and then ask Brian to peel back your question a little bit. First, we're pleased with the strong performance we delivered in 2022 and now being able to step into 2023 with a very attractive outlook. And it continues to reinforce that our Cigna Healthcare platform, including our Commercial employer portfolio continues to perform very well. I'd just highlight three areas quickly in terms of the underlying drivers or enablers of the continued growth for us. One, especially in the commercial employer portfolio is a consistent intense focus. We have, we are, we will continue to have a consistent intense focus on this segment as we see it as a growth segment. Hence, we focus and innovate for its benefit.  Second is a track record of excellent total cost or total medical costs. That is resulting from very good work from our network management team our clinical programs and the returns they deliver and our growing suite of site of care optimization programs that all contribute to good clinical quality service and overall affordability.  And then finally, what we've talked about before, but maybe it's sometimes forgotten, our orientation around consultation and putting solutions in place. So whether it's an employer of 100 or an employer of 10,000, we take an orientation of consultatively working to put the right solution suite in place for them. I'm going to have Brian peel back the drivers of our outlook, I will put one asterisk on it. We have not factored in an uptake relative to redeterminations as a contributor in our outlook for the year. We recognize that redeterminations present an opportunity for us, not a risk for us because we don't have that business to protect currently. But given it's still uncertain in terms of the rate and pace of state activity to adjudicate their redeterminations, we don't have that factored into this very attractive outlook. Of course, we'll present updates to you as the year unfolds as states go through the redetermination process. I'll ask Brian to unpack the drivers of our membership growth a little further. Good morning, Scott. Clearly, the initial or preliminary rate letter came out. But before I comment on that, just stepping back for a moment, it's clear that Medicare Advantage has represented and continues to represent a significant both market opportunity as well as a growth opportunity for the U.S. today serving about 30 million seniors continued growth and seniors reinforce the value, the clinical quality and the service quality they receive by continuing to renew and/or expand relationships in MA. The initial rate letter that came out does have lower or somewhat anemic revenue, we'll await the final rate letter that comes forward relative to that. Having said that, I think it's a little bit early to presuppose what 2024 growth outlook may look like because you compete on a relative basis. Having said that, this will create, if it stays in the range of what the rate letter looks like. It will create some revenue dislocation. So the sophistication of benefit management that's going to be necessary market by market. The leverage of value-based care relationships, which, as I noted earlier, about 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based care relationship will all come into play.  I reinforce the fact that the 10% to 15% is our objective to have 10% to 15% customer growth over time on average. We're stepping into this year with a very good customer growth outlook already that we feel good about. And as a final note, I would remind you that while an attractive long-term growth opportunity for us, today, this represents or MA represents less than 5% of the enterprise portfolio. So any dislocation in 2024, we deem to be manageable with the strong performing portfolio that we have in front of us. Justin, a little color relative to pacing and then I'll ask Brian to talk about more to your second question. As Brian noted, we have good visibility into the membership volume. And when you think about the -- outside of the individual exchange business, what we've seen growth across all of our funding types. Still the lion's share of it is ASO including the service-based relationship with a large customer. So in essence, a meaningful portion of that volume will be realized in the first quarter of 2023, and then they'll be puts and takes throughout the course of the year. We'll look forward to providing you updates on. Now individual lines of business will move throughout the course of the year. But by and large, if you think about -- our expectation is that we'll have good performance relative to that on the first quarter of the year and then some puts and takes throughout the course of the year with some additional growth and maybe some additional disenrollment as we factored in some impact in our outlook for a bit of an uptick in disenrollment as we look at the current fragility of the U.S. economy. So good visibility for Q1. I'll ask Brian to talk a bit more around the margin. Lisa, good morning. So to your first question, the co-preferred position that we have taken on our national preferred formulary is a mechanism to aid the transition, preserve and expand choice with aligned economics back to our clients and for the benefit of our customers and patients. I'd also note that that's our National Preferred Formulary, which is our largest single formulary. We support and administer multiple formularies that are customized for individual clients from that standpoint and avail choice. I'd also suggest that this will be fluid. It will flex over time. Third, as we've demonstrated within our PBM and our broad pharmacy portfolio services, we have the tools to align the incentives whereby when we enable choice and create value. Meaningful portion of that value are passed back to clients, customers and patients and a sustainable portion of the value is retained by us and the current position that we have taken aligns in that way. So it's not -- we have to have a reason of our brand drug versus the biosimilar, we have the mechanisms to afford additional choice, additional flexibility and to align the incentives. As it relates to the second part of your question, I would just give you by way of trend as opposed to an individual benefit design configuration or change, buyers in the space, be they corporate buyers, health plan buyers, et cetera, are seeking to push for more what we talk about internally all the time, coordination of services and continue to challenge point solutions. That plays very well for us. So when you think about an illustration of that, the Pathwell program around biosimilars, the Pathwell programs around biologics, the Pathwell programs around injectables is a way to further coordinate services with precision or a subset of patients and deliver more value from that standpoint, you have to harness data, you have to harness clinical capabilities, you have to harness digital capabilities. You have to harness network and benefit management capabilities. And again, the combined organization is well positioned for that. So I would say more precision in benefit programs on a go-forward basis that bring more targeted coordination, harnessing data and harnessing specific sub-segments. And again, we are well positioned for that and Pathwell is an illustration of that direction. Josh, good morning, good to chat with you this morning. So let me take your second question first. In aggregate, a small proportion is in full cap. As we've discussed before, our preferred approach typically has a shared risk relationship. Some of it is in global cap for sure, but a minority of it is in global cap, a majority of it is in a shared risk, longstanding shared risk program. And then another minority would be an upside only P4P in terms of new relationship pay-for-performance. So if you think about it in terms of a suite of capabilities, our sweet spot and our preferred approach is a shared alignment program, not a global cap program, but we have some global cap. To the first part of your question, you came back to the Village and CHE side of the equation. So I'd ask you to think about, first and foremost, the relationship with Village that was built out and expanded is an Evernorth relationship. That's not to take away from CHE, I'll come to the core of your question in a moment. And that relationship, as I discussed with a previous question, is around helping to broaden and target the reach, broaden the reach and then target with precision around subspecialty and then coordinate services in an even more precise way off of their already highly performing value proposition. Now that will be benefited to Cigna Healthcare, but also other health lands and broadly speaking, Village's patient panel over time.  Now specific to Cigna Healthcare, this relationship presents the opportunity to design certain benefit alternatives or unique product alternatives in collaboration with Village because of our closer relationship. That will evolve over time, and those conversations are manifesting themselves already. And the positive there is that that's building off of an already positive relationship. So back to the main course here is an Evernorth's relationship and further evolving their already strong performance in terms of reach, precision for the breadth of the panel. Cigna Healthcare will benefit from that. It presents the opportunity in targeted geographies and to bring specific benefit alternatives forward for the benefit of Cigna Healthcare and all that is on the docket relative to co-collaboration right now. That's why we're so excited about the partnership with Village. Good morning, Nick, it's David. I'll just give you a little directional indicator here. So throughout 2022, broadly speaking, we saw the kind of net effect of hiring still the lead dimension in terms of playing through. Although as we've talked quarter-to-quarter throughout the course of 2022, we recognized there was a softening in the economy. As we get through the latter part of the year and the end of the year, that pretty much muted down and approximates canceling itself off. So the net hiring versus the net disenrollment moved to a slight negative. As I mentioned in a prior comment, our projection for 2023 assumes a further uptick or a further softening of disenrollment as we look at the economy, we don't -- within our book as we go case by case and relationship by relationship, we don't see large dislocations, but we think it's prudent to plan for some further softening throughout the course of the year, and that's fully factored in to our projection. I wouldn't call out one individual sub-segment. The National Press would say that small employers are continuing to hire in terms of fight to get to full levels of employment. So we can see some indicators relative to that. But broadly speaking, I would suggest you to think about -- we believe we've taken a prudent outlook in our full year membership outlook by further dampening the additional enrollment throughout the course of the year, and we think that's an appropriate approach. Good morning, Nate, it's David. You should think about, broadly speaking, the formulated decisions are made in the latter part of the calendar year, so deep into Q4 of a given year for the next year with the best insights; two, there's always some fluidity relative to drug launches that manifest themselves throughout the course of the year. In the case of biosimilars, we know there are drug launches expected in the Q3 timeframe of this year, of 2023, that we've fully contemplated and factored in. And we have the ability to flex formularies in the course of the year with individual clients, individual health plans, et cetera, obviously, on a consultative fashion. So view the decisions are largely made in advance of the year. However, you have the flexibility to go back and make adjustments my comments are not specific to your specific question around manufacturer-specific contracts through that lens. To the latter part of your question, by and large, employers, health plans, et cetera, are focused on clinical efficacy and comparative effectiveness. So the fixation relative to first and foremost as it should be clinical efficacy, making sure when there's any alternative that's available in turning the best external validation of the clinical equivalent of the impact of a pharmaceutical is evaluated properly and then comparative effectiveness, looking at the economics and then getting to a total low cost of care or best value equation. And then the employer or health line may make some trade-offs in terms of which levers they want to use to achieve that, but ultimately, it comes down to the best total cost equation once the clinical efficacy hurdle is crossed. And as I mentioned in the prior question, we have the tools, we have the services, we have the flexibility to avail employer by employer, health plan by health plan to be able to get them to the right balance that they want. But ultimately, it's the low total cost equation with the clinical outcomes that are preferred from that standpoint that drive the net conversations and the net decisions by employers and by health plans. Good morning, Lance. So I think your framework is quite helpful. If you think about the building blocks you articulated, you laid them out quite nicely. I just would play with the order a little bit. Job one for us with Village is to work in partnership, right? It's not to push a product. It's a work in partnership to avail additional capabilities off their already strong performing platforms to further improve affordability or clinical quality. So let's take an example. Take the opportunity to curate in an individual market or submarket for larger markets, the highest-performing oncology providers for certain tumor types or certain diagnoses. Our longitudinal datasets enable that in a very differentiated way, be able to bring a bit more precision. The net result of that is, therefore, for a Village patient, a higher probability of getting the best possible evidence-based care and coordinated care and therefore, best overall value. Of which then Village benefits from that. The patient obviously benefits from that. And what we've designed is the Evernorth enablement benefits from that.  Point two is you want to distribution. We could bring more access in volume flow through the high-performing opportunities that exist here. There's no doubt around that, and we will seek to do so. And then third, where you came back to, we will absolutely help to enable these capabilities back, which is a subset of your distribution in a way back to our large well-performing portfolio of ASO clients by bringing yet even more precision of care coordination for their benefit. But in this case, we have through the Evernorth services and through the collaboration with Village, the ability to be rewarded in addition to the value we would be creating for their benefit. So there's multiple building blocks here, which is why we're quite excited. At the end of the day, if you put a big circle around it, Lance, it all comes down to how do we harness more data how do we harness more clinical coordination to bring even greater clinical quality and overall affordability, one patient at a time with a platform that is performing well, that is Village and then creating extenders and some care coordination that comes along with it. And through Evernorth, we have both the service mechanism and then the sharing mechanism built that will work in conjunction with Village for. Sure. Good morning, Dave. So relative to RADV and the new information that came out, first and foremost, we deem that risk adjusters are and remain an important tool for the program. And as I noted before, a program that has worked obviously for quite some time for the benefit of seniors and delivering excellent clinical quality, value and service. Additionally, from a Cigna perspective, we remain committed to executing, obviously, this program in a highly compliant fashion.  Now specific to the RADV actions, we're pleased, the CMS concluded that they're not going to extrapolate their actions prior to 2018. We're concerned that we continue to question a couple of decisions. For example, the elimination of the fee-for-service adjuster that we deemed to be foundational to the program. And we await specifics relative to the methodology that is going to be used in some aspects of the extrapolation and work as we have in the past and as we always will, we will work closely with CMS to seek to get further clarity relative to the open items that are here.  So a bit of a fluid environment but we see progress relative to the lack of extrapolation beyond 2018, and we see some open questions for the industry at large that still remain, and we will collaborate with CMS to get more visibility on that over the near term. Thank you. Just to briefly recap, 2022 was a strong year of performance, growth and positive impact that our company brought forward. With Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we demonstrated that we are serving the current needs of our customers, clients and partners, and we expect to deliver another year of customer and earnings growth in 2023. I want to recognize and more importantly, thank more than 70,000 co-workers around the world. It's ultimately their continued dedication and leadership that allows us to make a defining difference in healthcare and their demonstrated commitment to building on the momentum we've delivered to have a larger impact as we look to the future as we strive to improve the health and vitality that of those we're privileged to serve. With that, we thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to our continued conversations as we go forward. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference including the Q&A session is being recorded.  We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's third quarter 2022 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for 2022. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent report filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the third quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $23 million or $0.07 per share for integration and transaction-related costs. We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $1.4 billion or $4.52 per share associated with the sale of our international life accident and supplemental businesses to Chubb. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our team is performing well in a dynamic environment, and we delivered another strong quarter of revenue, earnings and cash flows. I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting key drivers of our results in the third quarter and while we are once again raising our 2022 full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share as well as for growth in medical customers and enterprise revenues. Then I'll address how we continue to expand and enhance our capabilities for the evolving market needs, and I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2023. Brian will share more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll take your questions.  With that, let's get started. During the third quarter, we delivered results that were better than our expectations, including total revenues of $45.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. We continued building out our momentum this year, and we are confident we will deliver on our increased full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10. We also expect to continue advancing our capital deployment strategy, including investing in our business to drive innovation and growth and repurchasing at least $7 billion of our shares this year, all while paying a meaningful dividend. Our performance in the quarter reinforces the impact of our sustained commitment to service and innovation, our progress in retaining clients and expanding relationships with additional services as well as winning new business. Evernorth, our health service platform performed well again with solid top line and bottom line results driven by our market-leading innovation and affordability across our pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy and Evernorth Care Solutions. Cigna Healthcare, our benefits portfolio also was key to continuing our momentum in the quarter. Our U.S. commercial business is having a very good year with solid client retention levels and new business wins, particularly in the middle market and select segments, leading us to once again raise our full year outlook for medical customers. Our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was better than expectations at 80.8% in the third quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our affordability initiatives and targeted pricing actions. Overall, we're very pleased with the third quarter results.  Now I'll take a few minutes to walk through how we are well positioned going forward with Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Within both platforms, we have differentiated businesses and a clear, durable three-part growth framework. First, through our foundational businesses, including our pharmacy benefit services, U.S. commercial and international health businesses. With these mature scale businesses, we established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental entities. Our capital-efficient operating models will further support steady growth as well as strategic and financial flexibility for our company. As we look ahead for these businesses, in 2023, pharmacy benefit services, we're expecting another year of high client retention levels complemented with new business wins. We're also very pleased with our solid start to the selling season for 2024, including our new multiyear agreement for Express Scripts to be the pharmacy benefits and specialty services provider for Centene. Working with Centene, we will make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for approximately 20 million Centene members. The strategic collaboration with Centene builds on Express Scripts' track record as a partner of choice and will present growth opportunities to provide additional Evernorth Health services over time. We continue showing how we have a unique ability to partner across the health care landscape, expanding our reach and impact to more customers and patients, and with this new health plan relationship, we are building on our previous collaborations such as Prime Therapeutics, Oscar and Kaiser Permanente. For U.S. commercial, we are driving strong customer growth with wins throughout 2022, and enabled by our consultative sales approach and our affordability gains, enhancing more competitiveness in more geographies, all while maintaining ongoing pricing discipline. The sales and net growth in our National Accounts segment are solid and outpaced prior year results, and we are confident this momentum carries into 2023. And in international health, we are sharpening our health care focus for targeted growth opportunities in serving individuals, employers seeking healthy and productive employees and governmental entities that value our care management programs. We have momentum this year in customer growth, revenue and earnings and expect to sustain these results and performance throughout 2023. The second way we drive growth is through our Accelerate businesses, which include Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and our U.S. government business. These businesses have outsized opportunities to grow with compelling secular tailwinds and as well as differentiated capabilities that benefit our clients and customers. Looking forward for our Accelerate businesses, we continue to be excited about the value creation opportunities in specialty pharmaceuticals, including biosimilars over the next several years. With our leading capabilities and expertise, we expanded our relationship to be the exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for the Department of Defense starting in 2023. This is further reinforcement to how we fuel sustained long-term growth in Evernorth by improving clinical quality for the benefit of patients and achieving significant savings for our clients.  In Evernorth Care Services, we are advancing our care management and delivery strategies. One area of focus is enhancing virtual care that strengthens relationships between patients and their physicians to better anticipate health issues and intervene earlier. For example, with MDLIVE, we are providing better experiences and improved affordability with personalized care that is more convenient and effective in directing patients to the most appropriate care settings. When a person -- when in-person care is needed, MDLIVE successfully guide patients to urgent care facilities or other alternative sites to care, decreasing avoidable emergency room visits by at least 10%. We intend to further build on this progress by enhancing our virtual primary care offerings for patients with chronic conditions by providing continuous engagement with their physician, remote monitoring with connected devices and real-time interventions between appointments. In U.S. government, we are continuing to make investments, positioning us to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are strengthening this business by building on our high-quality affordable Medicare Advantage benefits we offer with geographic and network expansion as well as further product enhancements. Finally, the third way we drive growth is through a cross-enterprise leverage. Here, we harness capabilities across our company to accelerate innovation and have a greater impact than any individual could have on its own. Our opportunities here are driven in part by a rich longitudinal data and information we have to accelerate the development of new, more effective solutions for our clients and customers. Our Pathwell programs are a good example. With Pathwell Specialty, we're working across the medical and pharmacy benefits to reduce the cost of specialty infusions and injectables. In our Pathwell Bone and Joint program, we harness Evernorth digital navigation and advanced predictive analytical capabilities to reduce unnecessary musculoskeletal surgeries and provide better coordinated care. There is a significant addressable market for these programs as 50% of adults suffer from bone, joint and muscle conditions, and these are major drivers to U.S. healthcare costs. Additionally, we continue to take an enterprise view of our client relationships and successfully broaden and deepen them with our overall suite of capabilities. This has supported a number of attractive wins and a good example is a very large new fee-based relationship for 2023 in our U.S. commercial team that has secured this offering by bringing a solution to a longstanding Express Scripts client. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and our growth framework, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth in 2023. We will provide detailed guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter earnings call.  Having said that, I'll provide a view of some of the tailwinds and headwinds we see for 2023, which are largely consistent with the points we highlighted at our Investor Day in June. With a strong selling season, we anticipate a tailwind of continued growth across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms. We expect additional margin improvement in Cigna Healthcare and with our leading position in the rapidly growing specialty pharmaceuticals market will begin capturing value from biosimilars. Relative to anticipated headwinds, we will make meaningful strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses. We will have additional costs as well as we prepare to support renewed and expanded relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. And a new development since Investor Day is our exciting strategic win with Centene, which will create a one-year headwind as we onboard this new partner. Putting all that together, we anticipate that these tailwinds and headwinds will largely balance themselves off next year with the exception of our Centene headwind, which represents incremental cost for us in 2023. Now I'll briefly summarize. Overall, our strong performance in the quarter and throughout the year shows how we are addressing the most pressing needs of our customers and clients and growing our business. We're investing in innovation to enhance our capabilities for future growth and continue delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're confident we remain on track for our full year 2022 commitments, including our increased adjusted EPS guidance for this year of at least $23.10.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're proud of another strong quarter and are pleased to drive continued momentum from the first half of 2022, with third quarter adjusted earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Looking at the quarter specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.3 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. We are pleased with the continued profitable growth in Evernorth, with our client-centric approach, deep pharmacy expertise and strong track record of service continues to resonate with new and existing clients. One good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Centene that will deliver greater prescription drug affordability and access for their approximately 20 million customers starting in January of 2024. This mutually beneficial partnership will bring significant revenue and will be financially accretive over the course of the multiyear contract term.  Turning to third quarter results for Evernorth. Revenues grew 6% over third quarter 2021 to $35.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued expansion of our Accelerate growth businesses led by our specialty pharmacy, as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments, which serve to deepen our client relationships and expand our services portfolio and digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another quarter of strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Our 2021 results presented an opportunity to expand future margins, and our team has executed extremely well and achieved both strong membership growth and improved profitability here in 2022. Third quarter 2022 performance continued this pattern as adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion and the medical care ratio was 80.8%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations and continues to demonstrate the impact of our affordability initiatives and pricing discipline. The favorable medical costs in the quarter were partially offset by lower net investment income. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 18 million total medical customers, growth of 873,000 customers or 5% year-to-date. We continue to drive strong customer and client growth in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022.  For corporate and other operations, the third quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $299 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included our earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, we delivered strong third quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2022. We have positioned the enterprise for continued strong performance in these dynamic times. As demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results and heightened reinvestment into our business. With that said, we remain mindful of the current economic backdrop and utilization environment heading into the upcoming winter months. In light of these moving pieces, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $179 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers while expanding margins over 2021. We are improving our expected 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.2%. We are raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings to approximately $4.05 billion. And we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to approximately 900,000 customers, which reflects strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Our full year 2022 enterprise SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments into our business.  Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 3, 2022, we expect to have repurchased approximately 22 million shares of common stock for $5.8 billion, including the accelerated share repurchase agreements announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. And during the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow from operations of $3.3 billion. We remain on track for another strong year of cash generation, providing us the fuel and flexibility for ongoing capital deployment opportunities. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, dollar margins and attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Results in the third quarter were above expectations, reflecting strong growth across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins. giving us confidence we will deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10 per share. We remain well positioned and expect another year of customer, revenue and earnings growth in 2023. Relative to 2023, we deem the current consensus EPS to be reasonable when excluding the Centene contract win. Although consistent with our historical approach, our initial guidance would have likely started more prudently. As David mentioned, Centene implementation-related costs introduced a net new headwind for our 2023 financials. That said, we expect the two-year compounded EPS growth rate from 2022 to 2024 to be within our long-term average 10% to 13% annual range, driven by the strong earnings contribution from our broad portfolio as well as 2024 contributions from the Centene contract win, following the implementation cost impact that we will incur in 2023. We look forward to providing you with more detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter call.  And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter : I just wanted to ask you -- and congratulations on the Centene contract win. I wanted to ask specifically, is it too early to have a view on what you're expecting the implementation cost to be in 2023? It sounds like you're kind of suggesting that we should potentially add that back to 2023 to kind of create a jump-off point. Is it too early to think that 2024, we'll see the contract to be financially accretive? Basically, how should we be thinking about that? Is 2024 too early to think about accretion?\nBrian Evanko : Stephen, it's Brian. I appreciate the question very much. So maybe I'll give you a little bit of a flavor for the multiyear view here. So I'd be remiss if I didn't start by saying this is a huge win for the organization and a great validation of the value proposition in the Evernorth segment of our company, and in particular, the Express Scripts team did a great job partnering with our new client here. And we'll be laser-focused on successfully implementing the new client over the course of the next 14 months to ensure a smooth execution of their 20 million customers. And as I mentioned over the lifetime of the contract, the relationship will be accretive to our financials. But you should think of the profit margin percentage being below the book average as is typical for a contract of this size and scale. But in terms of the year-by-year pattern and how to think about that, you should think of 2023 being a headwind, as both David and I said, due to the implementation related costs that are incurred prior to any revenue being received. We're currently sizing that at about $200 million for the 2023 year. Given we're only a week or so into the contract award, we still have a lot of detailed planning to do to refine that. But that's our current best estimate for what 2023 implementation-related costs will look like. For 2024, we are currently expecting to be in a neutral to a small positive contribution standpoint in terms of the income. So you can think of that 2023 headwind essentially unwinding in the 2024 financials. And then for 2025 in the subsequent years, we would expect to be at approximately run rate contribution levels on the relationship.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. \nA.J. Rice : Maybe just to ask, I know last year or coming into '22, you made a comment that you wouldn't be doing any larger deals, and I think you define that as anything north of $10 billion in acquisitions. I wonder as you think about '23 now, a lot's changed over the course of the year. You've been very active on the share repurchase front. What is your current thinking about whether you'd be open to transactions? Any comment about priorities or the pipeline and what that looks like? And then the flip side, of course, is your ongoing share repurchase activity. When you're giving these '23 comments, do you have any sense of where you might size share repurchase activity and all of that?\nDavid Cordani : A.J., it's David. So let me provide a couple of landing points there. First, stepping back relative to our capital priorities, our capital priorities remain consistent, which is, first and foremost, to make sure the ongoing growth of the underlying business continues to be funded properly from a capital standpoint as well as from investments in innovation. Second, to obviously service very attractive dividend; and then third, we selectively pursue all attractive and financially attractive M&A and/or return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchase. Specific to M&A priorities. As we discussed at our Investor Day, you can think about our M&A priorities, largely focused on our Accelerate business and within the Accelerate businesses, a bit more pinpointed within Evernorth Care in our U.S. government business. We may do tuck-ins in other aspects of our portfolio that are highly financially attractive, but the strategic accelerants would be more in the Accelerate business.  To your question relative to earlier this calendar year, we deem 2022 to be a bit unique for ourselves in that as we step into fiscal year 2022, we had the strong operating cash flow that Brian articulated earlier as well as the anticipated inflow from the divestiture of a portion of our international business at Chubb. So those two numbers create well in excess of $10 billion that we had to steward forward. That, coupled with our view of the price of our equity at that point in time led us to create as much clarity as possible for our shareholders in '22 relative to our commitment to share repurchase that we're on track for.  Looking forward, we'll maintain the capital discipline. We will be open to strategic M&A that advances us in the Accelerate businesses.  And then the final note you asked relative to '23, as you have in the past, you just think about we will deploy capital in the way I talked about before, either in a shareholder accretive way to achieve through the shareholder share repurchase and/or through accretive M&A and our contribution to our EPS growth rate in the 3% to 5% range year in, year out from the successful capital deployment that remains intact.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Just a couple of numbers questions. First, the accelerated growth in your stop loss revenue has been impressive this year. Just wanted to get some color on what's driving that? And do you think it continues at, we'll call it, a solid double-digit pace in 2023. And then quickly, your medical cost reserves were down about 5% in the quarter. Just curious if there was anything driving that?\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Justin, it's Brian. On the stop loss, we're really pleased with the strong growth that we've shown this year as you can see, both in terms of the quarter-over-quarter and the year-over-year premium growth with 13% and 12% growth, respectively, on that. Important to keep in mind, there's a few components that drive that. One is we've shown a very strong growth in our fee-based Cigna Healthcare customers this year, and many of those bring with them a stop-loss contracts. So there's some additional units, if you will, of stop-loss that are embedded in the year-over-year growth rate. On top of that, we have had strong firm price increases on our existing client base. And as you noted, now in the double-digit level with the 13% quarter-over-quarter, representing some of the later 2022 renewal dates, seeing strong price increases. And then finally, we have seen a bit of increased penetration on our existing ASO clients as well of the stop-loss products. So a few different factors that drove that strong growth. As we talked about in prior calls, we still have some margin expansion opportunity in our stop-loss book of business as we head into '23. So we would expect another year of strong growth in premiums for the stop-loss product in the 2023 calendar year. On the reserve side, there's really nothing in particular I'd call to your attention there. We continue to employ a consistent methodology to establishing our reserves. There will be some natural variability just between product mix shift and inventory levels changing from quarter-to-quarter. And overall, we feel good about the appropriateness of our reserves, and if you look year-over-year at the reserve levels, they -- all the key metrics that we evaluate screen appropriate and prudent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck : Great. Maybe just a quick fact question and then jump into the other question. But can you help us size the revenue that gets a little bit of difference on how Centene talks about the revenue contribution versus what it looks like CVS was booking from a revenue perspective. So can you help us size from a revenue perspective with the Centene contract and whether you get all of that in '24, whether that ramps up? And then I guess like my main question is just going to be about maybe going back to the M&A point, I just find it very interesting that you've got some competitors who are just out there constantly buying things and adding capabilities and other companies focusing more on share repurchase and selective smaller acquisitions. I guess, -- do you not see this as an arms race. It almost feels to me like a lot of companies are out there building capabilities. Do you feel when you think about M&A that potentially not pursuing M&A will be a disadvantage over the next three to five years if you're not doing deals today?\nDavid Cordani : Kevin, it's David. On your first piece, again, we'll look forward to providing you a lot more detail as we get into 2023 relative to 2024. At a macro level, I think the two data points to think about relative to the size of the relationship. And at today's state, there's about $40 billion relative to spend capacity. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, approximately 20 million customer relationships that will evolve and change over time. And as we provide more detailed guidance going forward, we'll try to separate that versus the revenue contribution. To your strategic question relative to M&A, first and foremost, I think you're framing is quite important. I wouldn't call it an arms race, I would call it stepping back. The marketplace demand for further value creation is and will remain consistently aggressive from that standpoint. Hence, innovation, additional value creation, strong operating execution and then selectively expanding your addressable market demand the strategy we deem to be mission-critical. Two, now stepping back to ourselves, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we're positioned with strong performing foundational businesses and well positioned to accelerate business. Those accelerated businesses are in sectors that have secular tailwinds. And then to the core of your point, how do we fuel additional capability growth. I'd ask you to think about it in a multipronged approach as opposed to M&A yes or no. One is significant targeted ongoing organic investment back into ourselves with new innovations and some of which I talked about today, some of which we profiled at our Investor Day, our new Pathwell programs, our unique longitudinal programs that take into consideration data, navigation support best-in-class clinical engagement with physicians and will increase value by taking costs out of the system through improving clinical quality. So organic investments are number one; two, is smartly and successfully leveraging our ventures capabilities to partner up with organizations to accelerate innovation; and the third is M&A. We remain quite open to M&A. We do not deem it to be a silver bullet. It's a part of the growth support strategy. So organic execution, investments in organic innovation, smart leverage of our ventures capabilities as well as M&A over time. And I would just come back and anchor it. Hence, our track record of strong top line growth, and strong bottom line growth with tremendous cash flow generation over the last decade by playing that recipe through which we will on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : I just really wanted to better understand as we think about the comment on the tailwind for 2023 around biosimilars. As you think about the plan design for '23, are you seeing employers and health plans willing to put the biosimilars on the formulary? I mean how much color and visibility do you have to that tailwind for '23? And is that primarily HUMIRA? Or are we thinking about other biosimilars as well? \nDavid Cordani : Lisa, it's David. First, relative to the category, as you know from prior conversations, we deem the category to be a net positive from a client, patient and customer standpoint as we look forward, '23 and beyond. As it relates to further improvements in affordability. And given the positioning of our Accredo capabilities, a net positive for ourselves. So just grounding on that for starters in terms of the capabilities to bring this to bear Second, 2023 represents the start of another step function, but the start of another step function as it relates to the biosimilars. Third, we will communicate our national formulary conclusions later this quarter, as you very well know, that's one dimension. And then there's client-specific formularies, decisions that are made that are underway.  So to the core of your question, it will vary in 2023 between international formulary as well as client-specific formularies on a go-forward basis. We deem it to be a net positive for the franchise in 2023. As I noted, it will present a tailwind for us in 2023. And that is HUMIRA-specific or the category specific, but others will begin to ramp as we move through 2023 into 2024. So a transitional -- I view '23 as a transitional year for the space with acceleration. Our decisions are about to be communicated and finalized relative to formulary decisions, and they're varied at an employer or health plan level. Our national formulary decisions will be consistent across that subset of our portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : So the $200 million you mentioned for Centene preparation costs, is that pretax or after-tax? And then my real question is the outlook for Medicare Advantage for 2023. I'm curious, I know you've made some investments through this year, and you've talked about opportunities for margin next year, but I'd be curious on the growth front. And if you could just give us some color on how some of the newer county expansions have gone in recent years, that would be helpful. \nBrian Evanko : Josh, it's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, and I think David will comment on the Medicare Advantage component. The $200 million that we quoted is a pretax figure. And again, as we work through the detailed implementation plans in terms of rate and pace. We'll continue to refine that estimate. But you should think of that as a $200 million pretax number for 2023 specifically. David, do you want to talk about Medicare?\nDavid Cordani : Sure. Josh, good morning. So specific to Medicare Advantage, let me take it maybe a little bit in reverse order to your question. Because as you articulate, we've been systematically adding new geographies, net new geographies and adjacent counties over the last several years. and successfully opening those counties in those markets. Second, as you would expect, your early sales in a net new market would tend to have a lower contribution than your sales in mature existing markets. The sheer nature of the operating cost environment and getting those businesses up and running from that standpoint. . Having said that, while we are very early in the 2023 decision-making process cycle as everyday kicks on, early presence reporting are positive as it relates to our current net growth algorithm and both in mature counties and markets as well as some of our new market entries. Looking at 2023, given the continued geographic expansion we've made, network improvement we've made, investment in distribution and marketing support as well as more resources and capabilities to begin to harness some of the commercial agents to Medicare, we expect [2003] to be a year of growth for our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and we look forward to updating you on that as we get through the latter part of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nLindsay Golub : This is Lindsay Golub on for Nate. Congratulations again on the Centene contract win. Could you talk through some of the opportunities for future Evernorth service expansion and just strategic collaboration with Centene?\nDavid Cordani : Lindsay, it's David. Thank you for the acknowledgment. And as Brian noted earlier, we're excited and we're proud to be given the opportunity, and we'll seek to earn that opportunity day in, day out. And as Brian noted, before going to the core of your question, the team is 110% focused on a successful implementation and initiation of the relationship on January 1, 2024, and is heads down relative to that. . As it relates to future opportunities, I want to get ahead of ourselves relative to that, but we've demonstrated over time when we successfully partner and successfully collaborate, we have an opportunity to broaden and deepen relationships. And we enter this relationship with Centene, First and foremost, needing to, wanting to and fully committed to performing on the existing commitment. And then availing Centene as a partner relative to our Evernorth capabilities and our broad service capabilities to co-collaborate and innovate. So we see opportunity over time, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves. We're focused on the present and the present is a significant win for us. I would wrap around it. Our track record demonstrates deepening of relationships and broadening relationships like co-collaboration and co-development, and that's what we will seek to do with Centene after we successfully deliver on this promise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : Wanted to talk -- ask about the ACA exchange market and how you're thinking about the setup for 2023 there. Obviously, some moving pieces on the competitive chessboard that should be favorable for potential enrollment growth. So interested in how you're thinking about enrollment growth for 2023 and then confidence in your pricing set up for 2023, if you do end up adding more membership than expected given some of the competitor exits confidence in also achieving your target margins for that segment as well?\nDavid Cordani : Scott, it's David. So broadly speaking, we have viewed this space as a space where we have an opportunity to grow over time. And as you all know, there's been a little bit of volatility since its inception, and we were -- we entered at inception and remained in the marketplace and continue to systematically grow. We'll grow our geographies as we step into 2023. And -- as it relates to the volume, we would expect to have net customer growth. Our current outlook is to have net customer growth in 2023, and we would expect that there would be a positive margin contribution. As Brian and I both noted, we expect the Cigna Healthcare portfolio in aggregate to have some further margin expansion opportunity. We believe that this subset of our space will have net positive margin contribution going forward. I'm not going to comment in terms of the latter part of your question went back to target margins as we continue to invest in, we know what the underlying book is performing at and what we expected to perform at. We'll make investment decisions in 2023 for 2024. That may dampen a little bit of the margins. Those are discretionary decisions for ongoing growth. But headline is well positioned for '23, expect to have net growth and expect to have good margin performance for the portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor : One quick one for Brian and one for David. Brian, just on investment income in the quarter, looked a little light, even accounting for divested assets, the return looked a little light. So just wondering if there was something there, perhaps a little nonrecurring in terms of potential run rate on investment income. And then for David, I had a couple of clients ask lately about the DOJ intervening in the AMA lawsuit as well as the AMA joining the class action on the multiplan lawsuit. I guess the question really is just the legal profile of the company changed in any material way. I just wanted to give you a chance to comment on those.\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Gary, as it relates to our investment income, within the third quarter, in aggregate, the investment income did slightly trail our expectations, but that shortfall was more than offset by the favorable medical care ratio performance within Cigna Healthcare, which allowed us to outperform both our Cigna Healthcare and Enterprise income outlook. Two things that are important to keep in mind as you reflect on that, and you referenced this in your question. The first one is the Chubb divestiture that was completed on July 1, resulted in a step-down of our investment income, and you can think of that as in the range of $50 million to $60 million per quarter. That's essentially removed starting in the third quarter. So any comparisons to historical periods need to normalize for that factor. The second area is within our alternative asset portfolio, which consists of think of this is private market, non-coupon assets. And this represents a minority of our invested assets, but it's subject to mark-to-market accounting for U.S. GAAP requirements. And given some of the challenges in the public capital markets this year, we had expected some downward mark-to-market adjustments in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and that did transpire. Some of the downward marks were a little bit larger than what we had been projecting. But as I said earlier, strong medical care ratio performance in the quarter allowed us to exceed our overall income and EPS outlook. And as you think about the future and trying to run rate this, if you were to remove the Chubb-related contributions from 2022, the all-in net investment income for '23, you can think of it as approximately similar to the all-in 2022 investment income. So either a tailwind or a headwind as we step into '23 and the investment income one. David, I'll let you comment on the Medicare Advantage.\nDavid Cordani : Thanks, Brian. Gary, your broader framework, Gary, I'd step back and say, we have -- we do and we continue to operate in an active regulated space. Two, I'd point to, as we look at today in the past, we have a strong track record as an organization of being well governed and strong, healthy compliance-related programs. To that point and to the core of your question, I do not deem that the legal exposure, I think, is where you're going after with the profile of the company has changed meaningfully. And in some ways, given the strategic positioning of our franchise being more services-based, I would make the argument that the legal exposure footprint on a relative basis to the space is lighter from that standpoint, given the services-based nature of our portfolio is more intense and heavy. But no doubt, it's an active space has been, is and will continue to be an active space, but we're proud of our governance and compliance functions and capabilities. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nRicky Goldwasser : Yes. So a couple of follow-up questions here. Just to clarify, for 2023, is the EPS starting point that we should use is the $23.10. And then as we think about the Centene headwind of $200 million around 2% of earnings growth, are you assuming that excluding Centene, sort of the core business would have grown at that long-term target of 10% to 13%?\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Ricky, it's Brian. So let me try to clarify some of the comments I made earlier as it relates to our 2023 outlook. So prior to the Centene contract award, the current 2023 consensus EPS estimate we see is reasonable. And so the last I looked this was in the range of $25.30, give or take a few cents. With the recently announced Centene contract, this will create an incremental 2023 headwind that will essentially need to be deducted from that 2023 earnings per share figure that I just referenced. . And then as I mentioned, as is normal, we typically start with our initial guide having some level of prudence in it, particularly since we have an at least EPS convention with the way that we communicate our outlook. So those are the different moving pieces that I would point to as you think about 2023. And then as I said earlier, relative to the two-year 2022 to '24 growth rate, we would expect that to be within our 10% to 13% compounded annual EPS growth rate range.\nRicky Goldwasser : Okay. And then just one quick follow-up question. As we think about the Centene contract, is there any leverage that you gain with the additional scale that you'll see across the rest of the Evernorth book of business. .\nDavid Cordani : It's David. Broadly speaking, a framework of growth always presents opportunity. So I think your basic tenant is positive here. Additionally, our opportunity to further enhance the value we're able to deliver to existing clients especially those with higher government portfolios of business and/or strengthen our value proposition even further relative to winning new clients on a go-forward basis. So I would give you a directional answer, not a yes, no answer, but a directional answer that growth is a net positive, whether it's the ongoing investment back in innovation, the capabilities in subsectors of the space in terms of being much more government intensive within this portfolio or otherwise, I would say, net directional positive. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette : I guess with the increase in membership guidance for '22 and the Commercial risk membership growth year-over-year actually accelerating as the year progresses. Just curious to hear a little more color just on the positive tailwinds there, kind of what's driving the extra commercial risk membership success?\nDavid Cordani : Steven, it's David. Let me talk a little bit more about the selling season, the dynamic in the process. As I noted in my opening, 2022 results for commercial portfolio business. First and foremost, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the MLR performance. We're pleased with the retention. We're pleased with the net growth. Two, in '22, a primary driver of that growth is good performance in our middle market and sustained success in our Select segment. Within our Select segment, we regularly offer ASO or self-funded with stop-loss, shoulder-to-shoulder with derivatives of and specific risk alternatives. And we provide choice, we provide choice declines relative to funding. We've designed our sales process, our underwriting process. And our solutioning process, we're able to put that choice forward. And year in, year out, it ebbs and flows between a different mix between ASO and stop-loss and risk business. We're pleased with the net risk results that underline that. But I think the overall headline is to sustain strong success of the Select segment.  Now more broadly, as you look at the portfolio, our fee-based business continues to grow. -- prior point it back to the meaningful growth in stop-loss. And finally, in my comments pointing toward 2023, we will have a very good national account, January 1. That's largely fee-based business. That's retention, it's expansion and this new business has as well as addition of large, what we would call middle market fee-based relationships going forward. So the underlying net growth is consistent. The quality is there in the MLR and our risk business, you see is really fundamental strength within our Select segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Yes. Congratulations on that Centene win, a great job. Two just cleanup questions. One is in Evernorth, just understanding the driver of fees in the Evernorth segment? And the other is just a comment on utilization. Obviously, MLR was really down this quarter. Just interested in getting any comments on relative to maybe a baseline or kind of pre-COVID levels for commercial, public exchange and Medicare Advantage contrasted with sort of the nonmedical products. Like what's kind of the environment you're operating in, they're seeing right now?\nBrian Evanko : It's Brian. So as it relates to the fees in Evernorth and you can see the strength in this line, if you look at the statistical supplement in terms of fees and other revenue with strong 16% quarter-over-quarter, 21% year-to-date growth. There's a few different components that contribute to this -- so one, this is where our MDLIVE business shows up, and we've continued to see strong growth throughout the year in utilization of our MDLIVE services. Secondly, we have a number of Express Scripts or pharmacy benefit services clients who choose a pure fee-based relationship with us. So we offer a choice relative to how they want to work with us as some of them might want a formulary or a network-only relationship. And so that shows up in this line item. And then also our Evercore business in terms of medical benefit management, some of the post-acute care solutions, et cetera, all roll up into this line item. So all these things in totality are showing nice growth for the Evernorth business. As it relates to your second question, I think that was pointed at Cigna Healthcare more specifically in terms of utilization environment. Third quarter did run favorable to our expectations. Most of that favorability was in the U.S. commercial book of business with our government lines essentially in line with expectations. And within the quarter, both COVID and non-COVID costs in the U.S. commercial book were favorable to our expectations. Non-COVID favorability was predominantly driven by inpatient and emergency room. And on the COVID side of the house, we saw third quarter COVID-related costs running at a very comparable level to what they were in the second quarter, whereas we had assumed a bit of an uptick. So broadly speaking, that's how I would summarize what we saw in the third quarter. All in, our commercial book of business is running just slightly above what a pre-pandemic baseline would have been trended forward to your question there with Medicare a touch below that.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley : I joined late, so I apologize if this has been asked. But as you think about 2023 and kind of Fed pushing to slow labor market and potential recession implications, will you be thinking about recession possibilities as you set your guidance for '23? And how do you think the business is positioned to be resilient against that?\nDavid Cordani : It's David. So I think a really important question and that we didn't spend time on that. So thanks for the opportunity. First, from our point of view, there's little doubt the economy has been confronting some challenges. So recession, non-recession, there's been some challenges. And to date, important grounding, we've seen little direct impact for the demand of our services or the underlying performance for our portfolio, right? Movement in costs here or there. But broadly speaking, we've seen a little direct impact. As we look forward, by and large, we still see an environment where net-net employers are more oriented in terms of maintaining and/or hiring employees seeking to get to full employment. We do see instances where that has slowed. We do see instances where employers are putting freezes. But when you balance the portfolio as a whole right now, there's still a net hiring environment that sits in front of us, not to today. As we look forward, we absolutely play through scenarios that could have further softening of the economy or recessionary impact. At this point, we believe, given the visibility we have into the starting point of 2023 with the net growth we expect to step in the year with, coupled with the strength that we expect in 2022 with, those two points and the various levers we have within our diverse services portfolio and benefits portfolio, we believe we'll be in a position to deliver another strong 2023. Ending with, we acknowledge the fact that the economy is in a bit of a challenged environment in the current state. But all in, we believe our portfolio will be durable and is in a position to perform next year because of the strong start we'll have to the year and the various levers we have to manage in our portfolio.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani : First, let me thank everybody for joining our call today, and I'll just wrap up with a few thoughts. First, our business is performing well. Our new collaboration with Centene is great evidence of the strength of our value proposition and how it continues to resonate in the market. We're growing with high levels of retention and winning new clients. We're performing well in this dynamic environment and our sustained disciplined execution is benefiting those we serve as well as our shareholders. . We are delivering for our shareholders and remain on track for our full year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $23.10, which is elevated from our prior outlook, and we are confident we are well positioned over the long term to continue to deliver on our annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% plus our meaningful dividend. This is all possible because of the breadth of capabilities we have across our organization, our proven commitment to innovation, but most importantly, the dedication of our more than 70,000 coworkers across the globe. I personally appreciate our team and what they do every day for our clients, our partners, our customers and patients and I thank them for the commitment to making a positive impact on people's lives each and every day. We thank you again for your interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our conversation as we go into the latter part of this year. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Third Quarter 2022 Results Review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's third quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're proud of another strong quarter and are pleased to drive continued momentum from the first half of 2022, with third quarter adjusted earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Looking at the quarter specifically, key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.3 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. We are pleased with the continued profitable growth in Evernorth, with our client-centric approach, deep pharmacy expertise and strong track record of service continues to resonate with new and existing clients. One good example of this is our recently announced partnership with Centene that will deliver greater prescription drug affordability and access for their approximately 20 million customers starting in January of 2024. This mutually beneficial partnership will bring significant revenue and will be financially accretive over the course of the multiyear contract term.  Turning to third quarter results for Evernorth. Revenues grew 6% over third quarter 2021 to $35.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.6 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued expansion of our Accelerate growth businesses led by our specialty pharmacy, as well as our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments, which serve to deepen our client relationships and expand our services portfolio and digital capabilities. Overall, Evernorth delivered another quarter of strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Our 2021 results presented an opportunity to expand future margins, and our team has executed extremely well and achieved both strong membership growth and improved profitability here in 2022. Third quarter 2022 performance continued this pattern as adjusted revenues were $11.2 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion and the medical care ratio was 80.8%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations and continues to demonstrate the impact of our affordability initiatives and pricing discipline. The favorable medical costs in the quarter were partially offset by lower net investment income. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 18 million total medical customers, growth of 873,000 customers or 5% year-to-date. We continue to drive strong customer and client growth in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022.  For corporate and other operations, the third quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $299 million. As a reminder, this segment previously included our earnings contributions from the international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses that we divested to Chubb on July 1, 2022. Overall, we delivered strong third quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2022. We have positioned the enterprise for continued strong performance in these dynamic times. As demonstrated by our strong year-to-date results and heightened reinvestment into our business. With that said, we remain mindful of the current economic backdrop and utilization environment heading into the upcoming winter months. In light of these moving pieces, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $179 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are also raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $23.10 per share, representing growth of 13% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers while expanding margins over 2021. We are improving our expected 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.2%. We are raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings to approximately $4.05 billion. And we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to approximately 900,000 customers, which reflects strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Our full year 2022 enterprise SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments into our business.  Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 3, 2022, we expect to have repurchased approximately 22 million shares of common stock for $5.8 billion, including the accelerated share repurchase agreements announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. And during the third quarter, we delivered strong cash flow from operations of $3.3 billion. We remain on track for another strong year of cash generation, providing us the fuel and flexibility for ongoing capital deployment opportunities. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, dollar margins and attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Results in the third quarter were above expectations, reflecting strong growth across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins. giving us confidence we will deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10 per share. We remain well positioned and expect another year of customer, revenue and earnings growth in 2023. Relative to 2023, we deem the current consensus EPS to be reasonable when excluding the Centene contract win. Although consistent with our historical approach, our initial guidance would have likely started more prudently. As David mentioned, Centene implementation-related costs introduced a net new headwind for our 2023 financials. That said, we expect the two-year compounded EPS growth rate from 2022 to 2024 to be within our long-term average 10% to 13% annual range, driven by the strong earnings contribution from our broad portfolio as well as 2024 contributions from the Centene contract win, following the implementation cost impact that we will incur in 2023. We look forward to providing you with more detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter call.  And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Stephen, it's Brian. I appreciate the question very much. So maybe I'll give you a little bit of a flavor for the multiyear view here. So I'd be remiss if I didn't start by saying this is a huge win for the organization and a great validation of the value proposition in the Evernorth segment of our company, and in particular, the Express Scripts team did a great job partnering with our new client here. And we'll be laser-focused on successfully implementing the new client over the course of the next 14 months to ensure a smooth execution of their 20 million customers. And as I mentioned over the lifetime of the contract, the relationship will be accretive to our financials. But you should think of the profit margin percentage being below the book average as is typical for a contract of this size and scale. But in terms of the year-by-year pattern and how to think about that, you should think of 2023 being a headwind, as both David and I said, due to the implementation related costs that are incurred prior to any revenue being received. We're currently sizing that at about $200 million for the 2023 year. Given we're only a week or so into the contract award, we still have a lot of detailed planning to do to refine that. But that's our current best estimate for what 2023 implementation-related costs will look like. For 2024, we are currently expecting to be in a neutral to a small positive contribution standpoint in terms of the income. So you can think of that 2023 headwind essentially unwinding in the 2024 financials. And then for 2025 in the subsequent years, we would expect to be at approximately run rate contribution levels on the relationship. Good morning, Justin, it's Brian. On the stop loss, we're really pleased with the strong growth that we've shown this year as you can see, both in terms of the quarter-over-quarter and the year-over-year premium growth with 13% and 12% growth, respectively, on that. Important to keep in mind, there's a few components that drive that. One is we've shown a very strong growth in our fee-based Cigna Healthcare customers this year, and many of those bring with them a stop-loss contracts. So there's some additional units, if you will, of stop-loss that are embedded in the year-over-year growth rate. On top of that, we have had strong firm price increases on our existing client base. And as you noted, now in the double-digit level with the 13% quarter-over-quarter, representing some of the later 2022 renewal dates, seeing strong price increases. And then finally, we have seen a bit of increased penetration on our existing ASO clients as well of the stop-loss products. So a few different factors that drove that strong growth. As we talked about in prior calls, we still have some margin expansion opportunity in our stop-loss book of business as we head into '23. So we would expect another year of strong growth in premiums for the stop-loss product in the 2023 calendar year. On the reserve side, there's really nothing in particular I'd call to your attention there. We continue to employ a consistent methodology to establishing our reserves. There will be some natural variability just between product mix shift and inventory levels changing from quarter-to-quarter. And overall, we feel good about the appropriateness of our reserves, and if you look year-over-year at the reserve levels, they -- all the key metrics that we evaluate screen appropriate and prudent. Josh, it's Brian. I'll take the first part of your question, and I think David will comment on the Medicare Advantage component. The $200 million that we quoted is a pretax figure. And again, as we work through the detailed implementation plans in terms of rate and pace. We'll continue to refine that estimate. But you should think of that as a $200 million pretax number for 2023 specifically. David, do you want to talk about Medicare? Good morning, Gary, as it relates to our investment income, within the third quarter, in aggregate, the investment income did slightly trail our expectations, but that shortfall was more than offset by the favorable medical care ratio performance within Cigna Healthcare, which allowed us to outperform both our Cigna Healthcare and Enterprise income outlook. Two things that are important to keep in mind as you reflect on that, and you referenced this in your question. The first one is the Chubb divestiture that was completed on July 1, resulted in a step-down of our investment income, and you can think of that as in the range of $50 million to $60 million per quarter. That's essentially removed starting in the third quarter. So any comparisons to historical periods need to normalize for that factor. The second area is within our alternative asset portfolio, which consists of think of this is private market, non-coupon assets. And this represents a minority of our invested assets, but it's subject to mark-to-market accounting for U.S. GAAP requirements. And given some of the challenges in the public capital markets this year, we had expected some downward mark-to-market adjustments in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and that did transpire. Some of the downward marks were a little bit larger than what we had been projecting. But as I said earlier, strong medical care ratio performance in the quarter allowed us to exceed our overall income and EPS outlook. And as you think about the future and trying to run rate this, if you were to remove the Chubb-related contributions from 2022, the all-in net investment income for '23, you can think of it as approximately similar to the all-in 2022 investment income. So either a tailwind or a headwind as we step into '23 and the investment income one. David, I'll let you comment on the Medicare Advantage. Good morning, Ricky, it's Brian. So let me try to clarify some of the comments I made earlier as it relates to our 2023 outlook. So prior to the Centene contract award, the current 2023 consensus EPS estimate we see is reasonable. And so the last I looked this was in the range of $25.30, give or take a few cents. With the recently announced Centene contract, this will create an incremental 2023 headwind that will essentially need to be deducted from that 2023 earnings per share figure that I just referenced. . And then as I mentioned, as is normal, we typically start with our initial guide having some level of prudence in it, particularly since we have an at least EPS convention with the way that we communicate our outlook. So those are the different moving pieces that I would point to as you think about 2023. And then as I said earlier, relative to the two-year 2022 to '24 growth rate, we would expect that to be within our 10% to 13% compounded annual EPS growth rate range. It's Brian. So as it relates to the fees in Evernorth and you can see the strength in this line, if you look at the statistical supplement in terms of fees and other revenue with strong 16% quarter-over-quarter, 21% year-to-date growth. There's a few different components that contribute to this -- so one, this is where our MDLIVE business shows up, and we've continued to see strong growth throughout the year in utilization of our MDLIVE services. Secondly, we have a number of Express Scripts or pharmacy benefit services clients who choose a pure fee-based relationship with us. So we offer a choice relative to how they want to work with us as some of them might want a formulary or a network-only relationship. And so that shows up in this line item. And then also our Evercore business in terms of medical benefit management, some of the post-acute care solutions, et cetera, all roll up into this line item. So all these things in totality are showing nice growth for the Evernorth business. As it relates to your second question, I think that was pointed at Cigna Healthcare more specifically in terms of utilization environment. Third quarter did run favorable to our expectations. Most of that favorability was in the U.S. commercial book of business with our government lines essentially in line with expectations. And within the quarter, both COVID and non-COVID costs in the U.S. commercial book were favorable to our expectations. Non-COVID favorability was predominantly driven by inpatient and emergency room. And on the COVID side of the house, we saw third quarter COVID-related costs running at a very comparable level to what they were in the second quarter, whereas we had assumed a bit of an uptick. So broadly speaking, that's how I would summarize what we saw in the third quarter. All in, our commercial book of business is running just slightly above what a pre-pandemic baseline would have been trended forward to your question there with Medicare a touch below that."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Our team is performing well in a dynamic environment, and we delivered another strong quarter of revenue, earnings and cash flows. I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting key drivers of our results in the third quarter and while we are once again raising our 2022 full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share as well as for growth in medical customers and enterprise revenues. Then I'll address how we continue to expand and enhance our capabilities for the evolving market needs, and I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2023. Brian will share more details about our third quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Then we'll take your questions.  With that, let's get started. During the third quarter, we delivered results that were better than our expectations, including total revenues of $45.3 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.04. We continued building out our momentum this year, and we are confident we will deliver on our increased full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $23.10. We also expect to continue advancing our capital deployment strategy, including investing in our business to drive innovation and growth and repurchasing at least $7 billion of our shares this year, all while paying a meaningful dividend. Our performance in the quarter reinforces the impact of our sustained commitment to service and innovation, our progress in retaining clients and expanding relationships with additional services as well as winning new business. Evernorth, our health service platform performed well again with solid top line and bottom line results driven by our market-leading innovation and affordability across our pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy and Evernorth Care Solutions. Cigna Healthcare, our benefits portfolio also was key to continuing our momentum in the quarter. Our U.S. commercial business is having a very good year with solid client retention levels and new business wins, particularly in the middle market and select segments, leading us to once again raise our full year outlook for medical customers. Our medical care ratio for Cigna Healthcare was better than expectations at 80.8% in the third quarter demonstrating the effectiveness of our affordability initiatives and targeted pricing actions. Overall, we're very pleased with the third quarter results.  Now I'll take a few minutes to walk through how we are well positioned going forward with Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Within both platforms, we have differentiated businesses and a clear, durable three-part growth framework. First, through our foundational businesses, including our pharmacy benefit services, U.S. commercial and international health businesses. With these mature scale businesses, we established core relationships with corporate clients, health plans and governmental entities. Our capital-efficient operating models will further support steady growth as well as strategic and financial flexibility for our company. As we look ahead for these businesses, in 2023, pharmacy benefit services, we're expecting another year of high client retention levels complemented with new business wins. We're also very pleased with our solid start to the selling season for 2024, including our new multiyear agreement for Express Scripts to be the pharmacy benefits and specialty services provider for Centene. Working with Centene, we will make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible for approximately 20 million Centene members. The strategic collaboration with Centene builds on Express Scripts' track record as a partner of choice and will present growth opportunities to provide additional Evernorth Health services over time. We continue showing how we have a unique ability to partner across the health care landscape, expanding our reach and impact to more customers and patients, and with this new health plan relationship, we are building on our previous collaborations such as Prime Therapeutics, Oscar and Kaiser Permanente. For U.S. commercial, we are driving strong customer growth with wins throughout 2022, and enabled by our consultative sales approach and our affordability gains, enhancing more competitiveness in more geographies, all while maintaining ongoing pricing discipline. The sales and net growth in our National Accounts segment are solid and outpaced prior year results, and we are confident this momentum carries into 2023. And in international health, we are sharpening our health care focus for targeted growth opportunities in serving individuals, employers seeking healthy and productive employees and governmental entities that value our care management programs. We have momentum this year in customer growth, revenue and earnings and expect to sustain these results and performance throughout 2023. The second way we drive growth is through our Accelerate businesses, which include Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, Evernorth Care Services and our U.S. government business. These businesses have outsized opportunities to grow with compelling secular tailwinds and as well as differentiated capabilities that benefit our clients and customers. Looking forward for our Accelerate businesses, we continue to be excited about the value creation opportunities in specialty pharmaceuticals, including biosimilars over the next several years. With our leading capabilities and expertise, we expanded our relationship to be the exclusive specialty pharmacy provider for the Department of Defense starting in 2023. This is further reinforcement to how we fuel sustained long-term growth in Evernorth by improving clinical quality for the benefit of patients and achieving significant savings for our clients.  In Evernorth Care Services, we are advancing our care management and delivery strategies. One area of focus is enhancing virtual care that strengthens relationships between patients and their physicians to better anticipate health issues and intervene earlier. For example, with MDLIVE, we are providing better experiences and improved affordability with personalized care that is more convenient and effective in directing patients to the most appropriate care settings. When a person -- when in-person care is needed, MDLIVE successfully guide patients to urgent care facilities or other alternative sites to care, decreasing avoidable emergency room visits by at least 10%. We intend to further build on this progress by enhancing our virtual primary care offerings for patients with chronic conditions by providing continuous engagement with their physician, remote monitoring with connected devices and real-time interventions between appointments. In U.S. government, we are continuing to make investments, positioning us to grow in 2023 and beyond. We are strengthening this business by building on our high-quality affordable Medicare Advantage benefits we offer with geographic and network expansion as well as further product enhancements. Finally, the third way we drive growth is through a cross-enterprise leverage. Here, we harness capabilities across our company to accelerate innovation and have a greater impact than any individual could have on its own. Our opportunities here are driven in part by a rich longitudinal data and information we have to accelerate the development of new, more effective solutions for our clients and customers. Our Pathwell programs are a good example. With Pathwell Specialty, we're working across the medical and pharmacy benefits to reduce the cost of specialty infusions and injectables. In our Pathwell Bone and Joint program, we harness Evernorth digital navigation and advanced predictive analytical capabilities to reduce unnecessary musculoskeletal surgeries and provide better coordinated care. There is a significant addressable market for these programs as 50% of adults suffer from bone, joint and muscle conditions, and these are major drivers to U.S. healthcare costs. Additionally, we continue to take an enterprise view of our client relationships and successfully broaden and deepen them with our overall suite of capabilities. This has supported a number of attractive wins and a good example is a very large new fee-based relationship for 2023 in our U.S. commercial team that has secured this offering by bringing a solution to a longstanding Express Scripts client. With our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and our growth framework, we anticipate driving another year of earnings, customer and revenue growth in 2023. We will provide detailed guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter earnings call.  Having said that, I'll provide a view of some of the tailwinds and headwinds we see for 2023, which are largely consistent with the points we highlighted at our Investor Day in June. With a strong selling season, we anticipate a tailwind of continued growth across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms. We expect additional margin improvement in Cigna Healthcare and with our leading position in the rapidly growing specialty pharmaceuticals market will begin capturing value from biosimilars. Relative to anticipated headwinds, we will make meaningful strategic investments in our accelerated growth businesses. We will have additional costs as well as we prepare to support renewed and expanded relationships with the Department of Defense and Prime Therapeutics. And a new development since Investor Day is our exciting strategic win with Centene, which will create a one-year headwind as we onboard this new partner. Putting all that together, we anticipate that these tailwinds and headwinds will largely balance themselves off next year with the exception of our Centene headwind, which represents incremental cost for us in 2023. Now I'll briefly summarize. Overall, our strong performance in the quarter and throughout the year shows how we are addressing the most pressing needs of our customers and clients and growing our business. We're investing in innovation to enhance our capabilities for future growth and continue delivering for all of our stakeholders. We're confident we remain on track for our full year 2022 commitments, including our increased adjusted EPS guidance for this year of at least $23.10.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. A.J., it's David. So let me provide a couple of landing points there. First, stepping back relative to our capital priorities, our capital priorities remain consistent, which is, first and foremost, to make sure the ongoing growth of the underlying business continues to be funded properly from a capital standpoint as well as from investments in innovation. Second, to obviously service very attractive dividend; and then third, we selectively pursue all attractive and financially attractive M&A and/or return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchase. Specific to M&A priorities. As we discussed at our Investor Day, you can think about our M&A priorities, largely focused on our Accelerate business and within the Accelerate businesses, a bit more pinpointed within Evernorth Care in our U.S. government business. We may do tuck-ins in other aspects of our portfolio that are highly financially attractive, but the strategic accelerants would be more in the Accelerate business.  To your question relative to earlier this calendar year, we deem 2022 to be a bit unique for ourselves in that as we step into fiscal year 2022, we had the strong operating cash flow that Brian articulated earlier as well as the anticipated inflow from the divestiture of a portion of our international business at Chubb. So those two numbers create well in excess of $10 billion that we had to steward forward. That, coupled with our view of the price of our equity at that point in time led us to create as much clarity as possible for our shareholders in '22 relative to our commitment to share repurchase that we're on track for.  Looking forward, we'll maintain the capital discipline. We will be open to strategic M&A that advances us in the Accelerate businesses.  And then the final note you asked relative to '23, as you have in the past, you just think about we will deploy capital in the way I talked about before, either in a shareholder accretive way to achieve through the shareholder share repurchase and/or through accretive M&A and our contribution to our EPS growth rate in the 3% to 5% range year in, year out from the successful capital deployment that remains intact. Kevin, it's David. On your first piece, again, we'll look forward to providing you a lot more detail as we get into 2023 relative to 2024. At a macro level, I think the two data points to think about relative to the size of the relationship. And at today's state, there's about $40 billion relative to spend capacity. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, approximately 20 million customer relationships that will evolve and change over time. And as we provide more detailed guidance going forward, we'll try to separate that versus the revenue contribution. To your strategic question relative to M&A, first and foremost, I think you're framing is quite important. I wouldn't call it an arms race, I would call it stepping back. The marketplace demand for further value creation is and will remain consistently aggressive from that standpoint. Hence, innovation, additional value creation, strong operating execution and then selectively expanding your addressable market demand the strategy we deem to be mission-critical. Two, now stepping back to ourselves, as we discussed in our Investor Day, we're positioned with strong performing foundational businesses and well positioned to accelerate business. Those accelerated businesses are in sectors that have secular tailwinds. And then to the core of your point, how do we fuel additional capability growth. I'd ask you to think about it in a multipronged approach as opposed to M&A yes or no. One is significant targeted ongoing organic investment back into ourselves with new innovations and some of which I talked about today, some of which we profiled at our Investor Day, our new Pathwell programs, our unique longitudinal programs that take into consideration data, navigation support best-in-class clinical engagement with physicians and will increase value by taking costs out of the system through improving clinical quality. So organic investments are number one; two, is smartly and successfully leveraging our ventures capabilities to partner up with organizations to accelerate innovation; and the third is M&A. We remain quite open to M&A. We do not deem it to be a silver bullet. It's a part of the growth support strategy. So organic execution, investments in organic innovation, smart leverage of our ventures capabilities as well as M&A over time. And I would just come back and anchor it. Hence, our track record of strong top line growth, and strong bottom line growth with tremendous cash flow generation over the last decade by playing that recipe through which we will on a go-forward basis. Lisa, it's David. First, relative to the category, as you know from prior conversations, we deem the category to be a net positive from a client, patient and customer standpoint as we look forward, '23 and beyond. As it relates to further improvements in affordability. And given the positioning of our Accredo capabilities, a net positive for ourselves. So just grounding on that for starters in terms of the capabilities to bring this to bear Second, 2023 represents the start of another step function, but the start of another step function as it relates to the biosimilars. Third, we will communicate our national formulary conclusions later this quarter, as you very well know, that's one dimension. And then there's client-specific formularies, decisions that are made that are underway.  So to the core of your question, it will vary in 2023 between international formulary as well as client-specific formularies on a go-forward basis. We deem it to be a net positive for the franchise in 2023. As I noted, it will present a tailwind for us in 2023. And that is HUMIRA-specific or the category specific, but others will begin to ramp as we move through 2023 into 2024. So a transitional -- I view '23 as a transitional year for the space with acceleration. Our decisions are about to be communicated and finalized relative to formulary decisions, and they're varied at an employer or health plan level. Our national formulary decisions will be consistent across that subset of our portfolio. Sure. Josh, good morning. So specific to Medicare Advantage, let me take it maybe a little bit in reverse order to your question. Because as you articulate, we've been systematically adding new geographies, net new geographies and adjacent counties over the last several years. and successfully opening those counties in those markets. Second, as you would expect, your early sales in a net new market would tend to have a lower contribution than your sales in mature existing markets. The sheer nature of the operating cost environment and getting those businesses up and running from that standpoint. . Having said that, while we are very early in the 2023 decision-making process cycle as everyday kicks on, early presence reporting are positive as it relates to our current net growth algorithm and both in mature counties and markets as well as some of our new market entries. Looking at 2023, given the continued geographic expansion we've made, network improvement we've made, investment in distribution and marketing support as well as more resources and capabilities to begin to harness some of the commercial agents to Medicare, we expect [2003] to be a year of growth for our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and we look forward to updating you on that as we get through the latter part of this year. Lindsay, it's David. Thank you for the acknowledgment. And as Brian noted earlier, we're excited and we're proud to be given the opportunity, and we'll seek to earn that opportunity day in, day out. And as Brian noted, before going to the core of your question, the team is 110% focused on a successful implementation and initiation of the relationship on January 1, 2024, and is heads down relative to that. . As it relates to future opportunities, I want to get ahead of ourselves relative to that, but we've demonstrated over time when we successfully partner and successfully collaborate, we have an opportunity to broaden and deepen relationships. And we enter this relationship with Centene, First and foremost, needing to, wanting to and fully committed to performing on the existing commitment. And then availing Centene as a partner relative to our Evernorth capabilities and our broad service capabilities to co-collaborate and innovate. So we see opportunity over time, but we're not getting ahead of ourselves. We're focused on the present and the present is a significant win for us. I would wrap around it. Our track record demonstrates deepening of relationships and broadening relationships like co-collaboration and co-development, and that's what we will seek to do with Centene after we successfully deliver on this promise. Scott, it's David. So broadly speaking, we have viewed this space as a space where we have an opportunity to grow over time. And as you all know, there's been a little bit of volatility since its inception, and we were -- we entered at inception and remained in the marketplace and continue to systematically grow. We'll grow our geographies as we step into 2023. And -- as it relates to the volume, we would expect to have net customer growth. Our current outlook is to have net customer growth in 2023, and we would expect that there would be a positive margin contribution. As Brian and I both noted, we expect the Cigna Healthcare portfolio in aggregate to have some further margin expansion opportunity. We believe that this subset of our space will have net positive margin contribution going forward. I'm not going to comment in terms of the latter part of your question went back to target margins as we continue to invest in, we know what the underlying book is performing at and what we expected to perform at. We'll make investment decisions in 2023 for 2024. That may dampen a little bit of the margins. Those are discretionary decisions for ongoing growth. But headline is well positioned for '23, expect to have net growth and expect to have good margin performance for the portfolio. Thanks, Brian. Gary, your broader framework, Gary, I'd step back and say, we have -- we do and we continue to operate in an active regulated space. Two, I'd point to, as we look at today in the past, we have a strong track record as an organization of being well governed and strong, healthy compliance-related programs. To that point and to the core of your question, I do not deem that the legal exposure, I think, is where you're going after with the profile of the company has changed meaningfully. And in some ways, given the strategic positioning of our franchise being more services-based, I would make the argument that the legal exposure footprint on a relative basis to the space is lighter from that standpoint, given the services-based nature of our portfolio is more intense and heavy. But no doubt, it's an active space has been, is and will continue to be an active space, but we're proud of our governance and compliance functions and capabilities. . It's David. Broadly speaking, a framework of growth always presents opportunity. So I think your basic tenant is positive here. Additionally, our opportunity to further enhance the value we're able to deliver to existing clients especially those with higher government portfolios of business and/or strengthen our value proposition even further relative to winning new clients on a go-forward basis. So I would give you a directional answer, not a yes, no answer, but a directional answer that growth is a net positive, whether it's the ongoing investment back in innovation, the capabilities in subsectors of the space in terms of being much more government intensive within this portfolio or otherwise, I would say, net directional positive. Steven, it's David. Let me talk a little bit more about the selling season, the dynamic in the process. As I noted in my opening, 2022 results for commercial portfolio business. First and foremost, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the MLR performance. We're pleased with the retention. We're pleased with the net growth. Two, in '22, a primary driver of that growth is good performance in our middle market and sustained success in our Select segment. Within our Select segment, we regularly offer ASO or self-funded with stop-loss, shoulder-to-shoulder with derivatives of and specific risk alternatives. And we provide choice, we provide choice declines relative to funding. We've designed our sales process, our underwriting process. And our solutioning process, we're able to put that choice forward. And year in, year out, it ebbs and flows between a different mix between ASO and stop-loss and risk business. We're pleased with the net risk results that underline that. But I think the overall headline is to sustain strong success of the Select segment.  Now more broadly, as you look at the portfolio, our fee-based business continues to grow. -- prior point it back to the meaningful growth in stop-loss. And finally, in my comments pointing toward 2023, we will have a very good national account, January 1. That's largely fee-based business. That's retention, it's expansion and this new business has as well as addition of large, what we would call middle market fee-based relationships going forward. So the underlying net growth is consistent. The quality is there in the MLR and our risk business, you see is really fundamental strength within our Select segment. It's David. So I think a really important question and that we didn't spend time on that. So thanks for the opportunity. First, from our point of view, there's little doubt the economy has been confronting some challenges. So recession, non-recession, there's been some challenges. And to date, important grounding, we've seen little direct impact for the demand of our services or the underlying performance for our portfolio, right? Movement in costs here or there. But broadly speaking, we've seen a little direct impact. As we look forward, by and large, we still see an environment where net-net employers are more oriented in terms of maintaining and/or hiring employees seeking to get to full employment. We do see instances where that has slowed. We do see instances where employers are putting freezes. But when you balance the portfolio as a whole right now, there's still a net hiring environment that sits in front of us, not to today. As we look forward, we absolutely play through scenarios that could have further softening of the economy or recessionary impact. At this point, we believe, given the visibility we have into the starting point of 2023 with the net growth we expect to step in the year with, coupled with the strength that we expect in 2022 with, those two points and the various levers we have within our diverse services portfolio and benefits portfolio, we believe we'll be in a position to deliver another strong 2023. Ending with, we acknowledge the fact that the economy is in a bit of a challenged environment in the current state. But all in, we believe our portfolio will be durable and is in a position to perform next year because of the strong start we'll have to the year and the various levers we have to manage in our portfolio. First, let me thank everybody for joining our call today, and I'll just wrap up with a few thoughts. First, our business is performing well. Our new collaboration with Centene is great evidence of the strength of our value proposition and how it continues to resonate in the market. We're growing with high levels of retention and winning new clients. We're performing well in this dynamic environment and our sustained disciplined execution is benefiting those we serve as well as our shareholders. . We are delivering for our shareholders and remain on track for our full year adjusted EPS outlook of at least $23.10, which is elevated from our prior outlook, and we are confident we are well positioned over the long term to continue to deliver on our annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 13% plus our meaningful dividend. This is all possible because of the breadth of capabilities we have across our organization, our proven commitment to innovation, but most importantly, the dedication of our more than 70,000 coworkers across the globe. I personally appreciate our team and what they do every day for our clients, our partners, our customers and patients and I thank them for the commitment to making a positive impact on people's lives each and every day. We thank you again for your interest in Cigna, and we look forward to continuing our conversation as we go into the latter part of this year. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead, Mr. Giacobbe.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian are going to cover a number of topics, including Cigna's second quarter 2022 financial results as well as an update on our financial outlook for the year. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties and is contained in the cautionary note of today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $26 million or $0.08 per share for integration and transaction-related costs and $17 million or $0.05 per share related to a strategic plan to further leverage the company's ongoing growth to drive operational efficiency. We also recorded an after-tax special item benefit of $20 million or $0.06 per share associated with litigation matters. As described in today\u2019s earnings release, Special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends and excludes the impact of any business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. As a reminder, we completed the sale of our international life accident and supplemental businesses to Chubb on July 1, which is contemplated in our prospective statements. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In the second quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients and partners as we execute on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. And we posted strong results for the quarter and continue to build on our momentum from the first quarter. Now today, I'll briefly discuss our quarterly performance and the key strategic drivers of our growth, then Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for the rest of 2002 as well as our strong capital position. and then we'll take your questions. Let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $45.5 million and adjusted EPS of $6.22 per share. Our differentiated capabilities and innovative approaches are resonating in the market, and we achieved another quarter of strong performance across our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we're pleased with the way our solutions are continuing to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers, governmental agencies, health care delivery systems and medical professionals. Today, more than 180 million individual customers have access to our Evernorth solutions. We're also encouraged by our progress during the selling season for 2023, and we are on track for another year of high client retention levels. In Cigna Healthcare, our disciplined execution is driving a balance of sustained customer growth and continued progress with expanding margins. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 80.7%, which was better than expected and a substantial improvement over the same period last year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a positive impact from the targeted pricing and affordability actions we put in place last year and in early 2022. Overall results during the first half of the year, including the strength of our ongoing performance give us confidence in delivering our increased full year 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.90. Additionally, we recently completed the divestiture of our life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in 6 markets across Asia Pacific to Chubb, and we launched a $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At current levels, we view this as an attractive use of our capital. When combined with our previously completed activity, we remain on track to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. Overall, we delivered a strong first half of 2022, and we are positioned to deliver on our increased outlook for revenue, customer growth and EPS for this year. Our performance is a direct result of our ability to leverage our expertise, capabilities and ongoing commitment to innovation, all focused on the most pressing needs of those we serve. Affordability remains first and foremost, a top need for all of our stakeholders. In response to this, we continue to drive target innovations, including, for example, a new solution launched in June that leverages our capabilities at eviCore to support post-acute care for Cigna Medicare Advantage patients. As the patient prepares for a discharge from a hospital, our team draws upon the extensive evidence-based guidelines as well as analytics we have to work closely with providers and patients. The result is that we're able to determine the most appropriate site of care and services to support a patient's recovery, which improves health outcomes, drives meaningful cost savings and provides better patient experience and satisfaction. We've also launched a number of programs that address the rising costs of vital medications. Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth's patient assurance program is an industry-first innovation capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin. In 2021 alone, we provided more than $42 million of financial relief to approximately 220,000 patients with diabetes. We've continued to broaden the impact of this program by expanding it to other chronic conditions drawing on the strength of our expertise as well as our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Building on the success of this program, last month, our U.S. commercial business introduced Cigna Pathwell Specialty, a new approach to specialty care. Pathwell Specialty leverages our specialty capabilities in Cigna and Evernorth and provides enhanced support to patients for better outcomes while also controlling rising specialty costs. We plan to extend this offering to additional groups of clients later this year. At our Investor Day in June, we talked about how we're able to consistently deliver sustained attractive healthy growth even in challenging economic environments. Our company is built to perform in a variety of market conditions, including economic slowdowns. It starts with our growth framework that positions us to expand our addressable markets and capture value in 3 specific ways. First, foundational growth. to our businesses that are mature, scaled and contribute steady predictable results for our company. These businesses currently contribute about 60% of our annual revenue and include Express Scripts, U.S. commercial and our international health business. Second is accelerated growth for our businesses with differentiated capabilities aided by secular trends creating very attractive addressable markets. These businesses represent about 40% of our company's revenues, and we expect to grow these further with momentum from our specialty pharmacy and care services businesses within Evernorth and our U.S. government business in Cigna Healthcare. And third, cross-enterprise leverage, where businesses work together to create value and capture more value than any one of them could achieve on the road. Putting it all together, this growth framework translates into continued strong top and bottom line contributions from Evernorth. Our health service platform continues to providing industry-leading pharmacy solutions while also building out our Evernorth Care capabilities to address the growing demand for behavioral services, health coaching and care delivery. Evernorth strengthens our ability to support customers and clients with the forces facing and reshaping health care today, including the significant societal shift, bringing widespread and growing recognition of the connection between mental and physical health. This has resulted, for example, in a rising demand for services, and we've continued to expand our traditional network. For example, Evernorth behavioral network has more than doubled in size over the past 5 years. We're also supporting enhanced services by providing virtual care. Recently, we launched Confide Behavioral Health Navigator to improve the way we guide people to the right behavioral care at the right setting at the right time. We also have an extensive and growing portfolio of solutions, supporting both virtual and digital first solutions, including our MDLive platform. For Cigna Healthcare, our growth framework translates into strong performance driven by ongoing customer growth in U.S. commercial as we continue to improve affordability in key geographies, including through advancing our value-based care and site of care service programs. Also accelerating Cigna Healthcare's adoption of Evernorth Solutions, which creates even greater value for our customers and clients and as a driver of attractive sustainable revenue growth for Evernorth. In International Health, following the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits portfolio, we are intensifying our focus on health and health service offerings. And in U.S. government, both for Medicare Advantage and individual family plans, we are delivering strong value for those we serve while we're investing in markets where we see sustained path for growth and a clear right to win over the long term. This balance and diversified approach to growth, together with our substantial capital generation affords us a significant level of strategic and financial flexibility that positions us for sustained, differentiated growth under a variety of scenarios. Now to wrap up. We delivered on our customer client commitments in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive continued attractive healthy growth across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms by leveraging our portfolio of foundational assets, accelerated growth businesses and fueled by the power of our cross-enterprise leverage. We are encouraged by our strong retention outlook for the start of 2023 as well as new business wins for the start of the year. We remain on track for continued delivery of our commitments. And as a result, we are increasing our full year outlook to at least $22.90 per EPS, which represents a growth rate of 12%, which is within our long-term average annual adjusted EPS growth target of 10% to 13%. We\u2019re continuing to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and we expect to deliver at least $7 billion through share repurchase in 2022 as well as continue to pay a meaningful dividend. We also continue to make strategic investments to strengthen our capabilities and broaden our reach in both our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2022 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We have delivered strong customer revenue and earnings growth in the first half of 2022. Continuing our momentum from the first quarter, with second quarter earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% off of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. This updated outlook reflects the strength of our foundational and accelerated growth businesses, coupled with cross enterprise leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.5 billion, After-tax adjusted earnings of $2 billion, representing growth of 10% over second quarter 2021 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.22. These results reflect a better-than-expected medical care ratio in Cigna Healthcare and continued strong performance within our Evernorth portfolio. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 7% over second quarter 2021 to $34.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by the expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our high-performing specialty pharmacy as well as a continued focus on affordability by delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments which serve to deepen our client relationships, develop new solutions and enhanced digital capabilities to expand our services in the Evernorth Care business. Overall, Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.3 billion, Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.7%. The better-than-expected medical care ratio in the quarter, was the primary driver of Cigna Healthcare's earnings results exceeding our expectations. The strength in our MCR was driven by a combination of strong pricing actions taken over the past 12 months, our continued affordability initiatives to lower cost for our clients and lower-than-expected utilization within the quarter. Non-COVID costs in the quarter were better than expectations across most service categories driven by lower levels in inpatient, emergency room care and surgeries and direct COVID costs were also lower than projected. Importantly, leveraging our customer engagement model, we are seeing preventive care utilization in line with pre-pandemic levels, including items such as annual exams, colonoscopies and mammograms. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 725,000 customers or 4% year-to-date. Our select market segment within U.S. commercial has already grown 6% year-to-date and remains on track for high single-digit growth in customers by the end of the year. Total medical customers for the quarter were above our expectations as we've seen continued growth and strong retention in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022. The margin improvement reflects our pricing actions and affordability initiatives taken over the course of the past year. For Corporate and other operations, the second quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $168 million. Overall, we delivered strong second quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong execution driving attractive top and bottom line growth, all while investing in innovation for the future. We are now raising our Evernorth full year adjusted earnings to approximately $6.125 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2022, and we are now updating our 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.5%, an improvement from our prior range. We are also raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to approximately $4.025 billion. And we are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 800,000 customers, which includes strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our foundational U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Turning to enterprise revenue. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $178 billion. Enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our full year 2022 SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 7.1% to 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Taken as a whole, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Our businesses continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive returns on capital. Year-to-date, as of June 30, 2022, we have repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, in July, we received an initial delivery of 10.4 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the accelerated share repurchase we announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. We have also increased our outlook for full year cash flow from operations to at least $8.5 billion, generating a very attractive cash flow yield. And we now expect full year weighted average shares of 312 million to 314 million shares, representing an increase of 1 million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to the sale of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses being completed slightly later than we originally had anticipated. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now we would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the macroeconomic environment, which carries potential risks but also opportunities. We have a strong and resilient enterprise with a diverse service-based framework, spanning broad addressable markets. And our first half results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and strength of our execution in a dynamic environment. We continue to proactively prepare with a variety of actions and tools to respond to evolving economic conditions and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow and deliver strong value to our customers, clients and shareholders. Now to recap. Results in the second quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong fundamentals across our diversified portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results, while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins, giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $22.90. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. So I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate a bit on the strong selling season or new sales that you alluded to along with high retention. Is that covering both the U.S. medical large employer group and also the PBM outlook?\nDavid Cordani: It's David. So yes, is the simple answer. So relative to my comments on the selling season, more specifically focused on the -- both in the Evernorth side of the house, the large employer, a large health plan side of the business. In the commercial side, the national account side of the business. So headline there is on the Evernorth piece of the equation. Another year of strong client retention overall for the portfolio as well as attractive new business wins. I think importantly to underscore as well, we continue to see traction of what we call enterprise leverage. So opportunities to deepen and expand relationships. First, within the traditional Evernorth portfolio, the successful renewal of the DoD also presented the opportunity to win and secure the exclusive specialty services. And then beyond that, we\u2019re broadening and deepening relationships with key health plan clients by leveraging the best of Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. On the commercial national account side, we see 2023, looking up to be a very strong retention year and some really attractive new business adds. So good, good performance on both sides of the equation. As Brian noted in his prepared remarks, also just continued strong performance in the commercial side of the Select segment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: I want to understand how you guys are thinking about the outperformance on the medical cost side as it relates to kind of getting back to target margins. Are you guys viewing the outperformance so far this year is kind of a new sustainable base? Or is this just kind of fluctuations of COVID hasn\u2019t really changed how you thought about moving from 2021 to 2023 pricing and margin expectations?\nBrian Evanko: Kevin, it's Brian. So thanks for the question on the Cigna Healthcare margin trajectory. Just to maybe rewind the clock a little bit. If you look back at 2021, that part of our business generated a margin of 8.1% which was below our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. And when we stepped back and thought about where we stood in '21, we decided to intensify a series of pricing actions as well as affordability actions in the middle part of the year and the last 12 months have resulted in the strong performance that we saw here in the second quarter of 2022. With our increased 2022 outlook, we're now projecting for the profit margin in Cigna Healthcare to run in the high 8%, just south of 9% relative to our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. You should view that as a sustainable place to jump off of. And we would expect, as we step into '23 that we'll be able to deliver within our targeted margin range of 9% to 10% for Cigna Healthcare, but likely at the lower end of that range, given the continued long-term margin opportunities we have in the accelerated growth platforms such as Medicare Advantage. But the stronger-than-expected 2022 performance we\u2019ve seen increases our overall confidence in executing against our margin goals while also reducing a little bit of the year-over-year opportunity for further margin expansion opportunity in comparison to where we stood a quarter ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshRaskin: I just wanted to focus on Medicare Advantage, seeing a little bit of attrition continued this year. And so now with bids submitted. What are some of the action steps directly for 2023 to reverse those losses? Do you think you can grow more in line with the market next year? And specifically, any changes in your network development or thoughts on value-based care and capitation?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, it's David. So our Medicare Advantage business remains a key point of focus for us. And as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, we view it as one of our accelerate platforms. So a platform where we have the opportunity for outsized growth over the long term. We continue to make investments in that business, both in the core aspects of the business as well as in the geographic expansion. Our 2022 results are not indicative of what we would expect to see over the long term. And importantly, in your question, which I think you touched upon insightfully one of the pieces, we did a bit of network reconfiguration to put us in some key markets in a position for longer-term growth, where we had attractive network positions, but not growth outlook from that standpoint. Shifting to '23, we would expect a year of growth to reaccelerate for ourselves in the Medicare Advantage business. As we discussed, that date by in geography growth today, existing geographies beginning to leverage the hard work that was done in 2021 and in '22 in terms of geographic expansion. Targeted and further investments in distribution and marketing as well as beginning to harness more yield out of what we think about in terms of our inside or more captive opportunities. Those are commercial agents that we talked about before, where we\u2019ve had a low conversion rate, our PDP conversions or a med sup conversions. So headline, yes, some network reconfiguration, a lot of that was addressed in this current year, harnessing the benefit of the geographic expansion work that was done and then harnessing some benefits that we would expect to see out of the channels I made reference to. Therefore, we expect 2023 to be a year of growth for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDave Windley: A follow-up to Josh there. Wondered if, David, with those expectations for growth in MA you expect to do that while maintaining margin? Or would you \u2013 to stimulate growth, expect margin to back up in MA at all? And then if you could remind us how your Star scores in MA will progress over the next couple of years and if the disaster relief benefits to the calculation were impactful for Cigna or not?\nDavid Cordani: So as Brian made reference to in the prior answer, I think it was to Kevin's point relative to Cigna Healthcare margins. He referred to the Medicare Advantage margins as being below our target margin. So as we grow the margin in the overall portfolio of business. That business is running at below target margins. We would expect to see margin improvement in 2023, to be very specific off of 2022's results and be able to grow although that portfolio will run below our target margins for a variety of reasons, including our investments in growth initiatives looking forward. But specifically, we expect growth and some margin expansion in that business, yet it will run below our target as we continue to invest in growing that portfolio. As it relates to the second part of your question, and Stars, I think you\u2019re identifying the phenomenon for 2024 first off of the present. We feel really good about our present Star configuration and the strong value that, that reinforces that we provide. To look for 2024 seems to indicate that the industry as a whole will have some Stars dislocation for the reasons you articulated. The disaster release configuration, the prolonged impact of COVID, the data transfer that comes across with that and the changes within the disaster release program. So we would expect to have some adjustment to our Stars consistent with what transpires for the industry at large. And obviously, that will become clear towards the latter part of this year for the industry as a whole as well as for ourselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Michael on for Ricky. I just wanted to get some more comments on your commercial repricing efforts. Clearly, you're doing improved MLR performance year-to-date. Membership growth peers healthy, which suggests stickiness, positive receptivity here from pricing. I'm just curious on your thoughts about where is Cigna in your overall targeted repricing efforts?\nDavid Cordani: Michael, it's David. Let me just briefly start and hand it over to Brian. First, to underscore, we're quite pleased with the results. Our teams are executing quite well. And Brian will come across the pricing, but he underscored in his prepared remarks as well, the affordability. It's 2 dimensions working together. So -- it's getting first and foremost, consultatively the right solutions in place, employer by employer within all of our segments, whether they're select segment employers. What the market knows is middle market employers were national account employers and then it's executing the right affordability initiatives to be able to give -- deliver the right value and then executing from a pricing standpoint. So I want to underscore, it\u2019s both of those pieces coming together to create the sustainability and our attractive underlying both retention and new business growth, coupled with the margins we\u2019re quite pleased with. Brian, I\u2019ll ask you to speak a little bit more towards the pricing dimension.\nBrian Evanko: Sure, David. As it relates to pricing in the commercial book of business, this year's 2022 medical care ratio performance has resulted in a higher margin profile for Cigna Healthcare, and that's driven largely by our commercial employer book of business. So we\u2019ve recaptured a bit more margin in 2022 than we originally anticipated. The good news is that means there\u2019s less correction that\u2019s needed on a prospective basis. So we\u2019ll certainly be pricing to our forward look at cost trend as we head into 2023, but we don\u2019t need a meaningful step change as it relates to the commercial employer margin profile. The one nuance in that is our stop-loss portfolio as we talked about in our fourth quarter results did have some pressure in 2021. That pressure has continued at the level we expected in 2022. So as we step into \u201823, there will be a little bit of a reprice on some of those clients but we were able to get, again, more margin recapture here in \u201822 than we had anticipated in the commercial employer book of business.\nOperator: And this question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\nA.J. Rice: Maybe just following up on talking about the selling season and what you're seeing out there. I guess employers are faced with a lot of cross currents macroeconomic questions. Obviously, their own labor issues, questions about providers wanting relief on their labor challenges and other inflationary costs. How are those playing into the discussions? I wondered what innovative products that are \u2013 wood products are particularly resonating. And also, one of your peers said that they were seeing some people postpone full-blown RFPs just given everything that\u2019s going on and maybe delaying it for a year. Would you characterize the selling activity as is pretty normal? Or are you seeing any of that?\nDavid Cordani: It's David. So I think the dimension to your question first on the second piece, we see a very active pipeline. We've seen an active pipeline. As I noted previously, our retention results have been strong and importantly, underscoring even in 2022, commented relative to 23 start. But in '22, our retention results are strong even with the rate execution that Brian made reference to. So good retention within our portfolio, quite an active pipeline across various aspects of our business. On the first part of your question, it's a really long conversation. Let me boil it down. There's no doubt that the environment remains dynamic, disrupted, challenging from an employer standpoint to be able to attract, retain, have the engagement levels for their coworkers. A couple of phenomenons I would underscore to your point. One, in the prolonged pandemic environment, employers are dealing with, call it, the nomadic lifestyle of more of their employees. So first and foremost, on the commercial side, truly having a seamless commercial network for their employees because the higher percentage of the coworkers are consuming care in various locations as opposed to more traditional or centralized locations geographically. Secondly, seeking to advance as aggressively as possible, behavioral health services and the connection of behavioral health services with physical health services. And I highlighted several of those in my prepared remarks. That remains front and center. Third, on the cost and the affordability side of the equation, open-mindedness even push to more aggressively adopt whether they\u2019re site of care optimization programs. So how do you get better affordability with existing even improve quality by optimizing site of care for an individual patient or bringing more services closer to the individual, both dealing with the nomadic lifestyle as well as site of care, virtual digital-first, closer intimacy. And those are areas that have been high on strategy for us. So you\u2019re correct. There\u2019s a lot of dynamism in the marketplace today, being consultative in terms of putting the right solution suite together, mission-critical, having the services between our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare portfolio mission-critical right now and then being able to optimize that national network, the site of care optimization kind of the multimodal virtual coordinated care is mission-critical right now. A.J., I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: I wanted to talk about the $22.90 this year. You've answered some of the questions in terms of the commercial business specifically. But just in terms of the jump-off point for 2023 earnings, anything we should think about in terms of whether this may or may not be a reasonable starting point versus that 10% to 13% target growth? And then any headwind tailwinds you want us to consider when thinking about that 10% to 13% kind of target digging into next year?\nBrian Evanko: Justin, it's Brian. I'll start and then, David, I think maybe we'll chime in on the headwinds, tailwinds component. At a macro level, you should not think of there being massive amounts of nonrecurring items favorable or unfavorable in the 2022 performance. So you should view the $22.90 is a reasonable jump-off point. As we look back at prior year development, which has been largely in line with prior calendar years, the amount of activity we're seeing in the second quarter, Cigna Healthcare book of business as it relates to fundamental strength is quite high. So meaning there\u2019s not any meaningful things we\u2019d call out that are substantial, and that would be 2022 specific for purposes of doing those adjustments at this point in time. That could change as the year unfolds. But broadly speaking, I jump off to $22.90. David, do you think about with a tailwind, do you want to jump in on that, please?\nDavid Cordani: Sure, Brian. Thanks. And Brian, maybe under your point. Therefore, we seldom talk through about a rebasing framework, Justin. As it relates to headwind tailwinds, we would typically go through that in more detail on the third quarter call and then detailed guidance in the fourth quarter call, but maybe a step back to, as you may recall from Investor Day, we talked about a few of the more macro opportunities for 2023. So first and foremost, think about foundational and fundamental growth across our businesses. As we commented today, we would expect another year of growth for the organization, both on the Cigna Healthcare side of the equation as well as Evernorth side of the equation. Secondly, a topic we have not discussed here, but we discussed previously at Investor Day we would expect to see further contributions from the biosimilar trend, which will begin to accelerate 2023, accelerate further in 2024, but some contribution of the biosimilar trend, of which we are well positioned and configured to deliver value for our clients, customers and patients on as well as benefit for our shareholders. On the headwind side, just to give illustrations, we\u2019ve highlighted set up \u2013 what we call setup costs for very large clients, whether they\u2019re very large client renewals or expansions. There\u2019s a set of costs in a gestation cycle relative to that. And then lastly, the rate and pace of our strategic investments that we choose to make given the rapid changes in the environment may create a little bit more headwind year-over-year, which we would highlight. But net-net, we would expect another positive year for 2023, off of what is shaping up to be a very strong year for 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: Just want to ask a little more about medical loss ratio, which was so favorable. So congrats on that. But just a few different questions, if I could. One, the sequential decline in 2Q is pretty unusual for your books seasonality. I know we have international health care in there now, and I'm just wondering if that contributes to any different view of seasonality sequentially from 1Q, 2Q? Also a year ago, you had highlighted behavioral and substance abuse is putting a lot of pressure on 2Q. I just wondered if that's changed at all? And then also just on stop-loss, you had talked about still believing that would be a pressure all the way through \u201822 with pricing initiatives having more effect in \u201823. So just wondering, are you producing this strong MLR on the lower-than-expected utilization still with stop-loss being a bit of a headwind inside of it?\nBrian Evanko: Gary, it's Brian. I'll do my best to take each of those components of your question. And I appreciated the lead-in that you started with there. We are really pleased with the strength in the medical care ratio in the second quarter. So and it really was a fundamental strength across the portfolio with our U.S. commercial employer book really being the primary driver of the strength. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we saw favorability both in non-COVID and in COVID-related costs in the quarter. So strength in both parts of that portfolio, again, which reflects our affordability initiatives as well as a lesser utilization than we had been forecasting. As it relates to the sequential decline, you should not think of the international health business as a material driver of that. This was really a quarter we had favorable cost experience relative to our prior expectations, as opposed to anything unique or nuanced by adding the international book in there. As it relates to behavioral health, you're right, last year, we saw higher than typical cost trends in our behavioral health book of business, which we actually viewed as a good thing from the standpoint of people getting the care that they needed. That's moderated a bit here in 2022, meaning the cost trends we're seeing on behavioral are lower than they were in 2021. And as a result of that, that's provided a little bit of quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year favorability. And then finally, on your point about stop-loss, as I mentioned on the earlier question that Michael asked, the 2022 stop-loss MCR performance is largely in line with our expectations. So when we reset the 2021 MCR pick at the end of the year, given the pressure we saw, we had said we would not be able to reprice most of the '22 book just given the timing of when that emerged. And so that's our expectation. That's what we're seeing in the actual. So the MCR outlook for '22 and stop off very similar to the MCR outlook for '21, which gives us a repricing opportunity in 2023. So you kind of step back from all of this and the favorability we're seeing in commercial is largely not stop loss related. It's largely related to the non-COVID and the COVID-related cost on first dollar coverages and our fully insured and other risk businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: I just wanted to follow up with a couple of questions around the PBM. So, one. When we think about the selling season, David, you talked about very strong retention. Should I assume that, that's in the very high 90% range? Would be first. Second, as we think about -- you talked about biosimilars, we think about plan design for 2023, are you starting to put biosimilars on the formulary in 2023? We'll see that impact in '23? Or will this really be more of a '24 opportunity? And then just lastly, there\u2019s been some changes on the manufacturing side for 340B. I didn\u2019t hear you call that out as a headwind. I\u2019m just curious if you had any headwinds as it pertains to 340B and the Express Scripts book of business?\nDavid Cordani: Lisa, it's David. You packed a lot in there. So let me try to run through them. First, from a retention standpoint, think about 95-plus. We believe anything in the mid-90s plus is a quite strong result given the diversity of our business for that portfolio. And as I noted on the prior comment, in addition to that, think about us continuing to deepen the relationships we have with broadening of services. As I noted, whether it's adding specialty exclusive or otherwise as well as the enterprise leverages, we have some relationships that are becoming deeper with leveraging Cigna Healthcare capabilities for legacy Evernorth relationships or vice versa. But think retention, 95-plus is something that we view as quite attractive. As it relates to the biosimilars, your specific question on formulary that finalization typically takes place as we approach the fourth quarter. So the dynamism being managed through. And as you know, with your background relative to the space, there's a lot of dynamism relative to that as it relates to choice client by client as well. We think about our national preferred formulary finalization more approaching the fourth quarter versus in the current dynamic and time frame. And specific to the timing of the opportunity, as we discussed previously, I would think about the biosimilar acceleration. While there's some movement, obviously, in 2022, '23 is active year with fixation and focus on HUMIRA and the transition. That will begin to ramp in 2000 and contributions will begin to ramp in 2023, but accelerate much further in '24 and obviously going to '25. Lastly, relative to 340B. As folks know, 340B is a really important program that a lot of health care delivery systems benefit from as they serve disadvantaged and underserved populations to help them get the right level of affordability. There's been some dislocation in that program and some pharmaceutical manufacturers have you lately decided to stop or decrease or create tension for health care delivery systems participation in that. As it relates to Cigna specifically through our Evernorth portfolio, it\u2019s not a material driver of 2022 results, hence, we didn\u2019t call it out. Any change or disruption, and that is not a material driver to 2022 results from that standpoint, although there\u2019s been some activity, and we\u2019ve seen some deceleration in volume as some of the data transfer tension has grown. We\u2019ve seen that a little bit trough in the second quarter, and we see emergence of some improvement or acceleration in those activities in the beginning of the third quarter here as we work with health care delivery systems to try to help them get the data across that pharmaceutical manufacturers are challenging them to deliver. But again, not a material driver for us thus far, Lisa.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: I guess I\u2019d like to ask about sort of potential drug price legislation. That looks like it may actually pass this time in Congress. So I was wondering if you\u2019ve taken a look at it and what the potential impact could be on Evernorth, either positively or negatively from what\u2019s being proposed?\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, it's David. You're correct, there's -- once again, some proposed legislation that's manifesting. And in the builders, there's orientation relative to pharmaceutical pricing. Stepping back, big picture, if you look at the breadth and the shape of our Evernorth portfolio as well as the diversification of services we have, both on the core pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, the innovation we've been able to bring to the market, the clinical programs we have, the significant amount of transparency we have with clients of a variety of choices. There is no item that we see currently in any of the proposed legislation that we view as a unique or a significant dislocation to our business. That doesn't mean there's not an environment of change. But back to managing the portfolio, the breadth of our services, the continued commitment to innovation, the evolution of our clinical programs, the evolution of our financing and funding mechanisms, affording choice to our commercial clients, health plan clients, et cetera, from that standpoint, positions us as we best see well even with the proposed legislation, and we continue to track the emergence of that day to day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: I just wanted to ask a follow-up on some of the MLR commentary from earlier in the call. And I guess, specifically with regards to the outlook for the back half of the year, I guess, does the raise of the MLR outlook kind of embed any favorability in the back half? And I guess, have you seen any indications of any sort of pent-up demand? Or does sort of the macro environment that we\u2019re seemingly in, does that influence your view of how utilization might trend over the balance of the year?\nBrian Evanko: It's Brian. So as it relates to the MLR outlook for the back half of the year, so stepping back again in the second quarter, we saw a very favorable result relative to our prior expectations. And if you recall from our first quarter earnings release, we felt that it was prudent to assume that 2022 medical cost performance would look a lot like 2021 when you look at the all-in combined effect of COVID and non-COVID cost. So the terminology, if you recall, we would use the time would be above baseline. For purposes of the back half of the year, we have assumed that the medical cost performance will be largely consistent with our previous planning assumptions, meaning we have not assumed the second quarter favorability will run rate or extend through the back half of the year. So obviously, if the remaining 2 quarters were to run more in line with what we saw in the second quarter, there will be favorability in the second half of the year results from the standpoint of the MCR and as such, the income outlook. We\u2019re not yet seeing on the second part of your question, any meaningful signs of pent-up demand or acuity building in the book of business. So as I mentioned earlier, when we look at blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies, all of those on a per capita basis are very much in line with where they were in 2019, and we continue to see things like when cancers present the percentage that are metastatic is very consistent with where it was in 2019. And so the favorability we\u2019re seeing in the results, we don\u2019t attribute to a meaningful amount of care not being consumed that needs to be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: Just wanted to follow up quickly on the MLR commentary you provided there. When we think about the upside in the quarter, I guess, any sense you can provide on how much of that was driven by favorable intra-year development versus your current period accruals? And then, as we think about the MLR progression through the balance of the year, I appreciate the commentary that you\u2019re expecting consistent with your prior planning cycle for above baseline utilization. Should we also be thinking about potentially a tailwind from midyear renewals that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see in a typical year? And just remind us how much of your employer book reprices midyear?\nBrian Evanko: Stephen, it's Brian again. So relative to what we saw in the second quarter MCR, as I mentioned earlier, U.S. commercial was the primary driver of the favorability. Our government products largely ran in line with our expectations. And within the commercial employer book of business, we did have some favorability from first quarter reserve development, but that was the minority of the favorability in the experience. The primary driver were second quarter dates of service running favorable to our projections, which, again, is a function of both lower utilization than we expected, but also the affordability initiatives really holding -- or taking hold in the quarter. So we saw a strong site of care optimization in the quarter and other things such as that, helping to contribute to the favorable results in the quarter. As it relates to repricing for the balance of the year, the smaller part of our business, select segment tends to have a more even renewal date schedule as compared to our national accounts business, which tends to be very heavy 1/1. So you should think of on the select segment, about 2/3 of the clients have 1/1 effective dates and the other 1/3 have effective dates later in the year. So there is some opportunity for us to reprice that business that\u2019s been factored into our outlook in terms of the rate actions we have either already secured or intend to secure for the balance of the year. So that\u2019s been factored into the outlook and we\u2019ve been really pleased with the strong execution of our U.S. commercial team. We\u2019re delivering both improved margins and net customer growth in a challenging year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: So within Evernorth, you mentioned the 2Q results were in line with our expectations. And I guess, and with both the top line, the bottom line growth year-over-year in Evernorth slowing a little bit -- really showing some slight deceleration year-over-year versus the growth in 1Q. Just wanted to give a little more color around that as far as what was baked in the expectations. I know last quarter, you talked about how you were continuing to make some meaningful strategic investments in Evernorth the expansion of client relationships. So I guess I\u2019m just curious how those investments may have progressed and impacted the results in the quarter for Evernorth.\nDavid Cordani: Steven, it's David. Just to the macro level, 2 points. One, we remain quite pleased with the overall performance of Evernorth and the sustained performance within Evernorth. Two, to your point, I give you caution in terms of triangulating any one quarterly pattern. You're correct, the rate and pace of the investments we're making. You made a reference relative to the Q-over-Q revenue growth, a little bit of the lumpiness in terms of the way the revenue manifests itself, for example, in Q1 and Q2 of last year. But the overall revenue trajectory and the overall earnings trajectory is quite helpful. Lastly, kind of pivoting down into your investment piece, we continue to make accelerated and growing investments within our accelerate platforms, 2 of those are within Evernorth, specifically the specialty pharmaceutical business through both Accredo and CuraScripts, but heavily targeted towards the Evernorth Care piece. We showcased some of the direction of that at our Investor Day and you should continue to expect to see us continue to ramp relative to that. So if there\u2019s any pattern or outside spending or investments that manifest itself beyond the large client set up costs, it\u2019s really the strategic investments we\u2019re making within our Evernorth care part of the equation today.\nBrian Evanko: Just one add for you, Steven, in terms of the modeling on the revenue side. In 2021, we had relatively steep sequential growth as it relates to the quarterly pattern of Evernorth revenue. A lot of that was driven by the onboarding of specific clients for our specialty programs. associated with the Prime Therapeutics relationship, the 2022 pattern is less steep, which is driving a little bit of the top line deceleration you made reference to. However, we\u2019ll see sequential growth in each quarter this year and we\u2019re on track for a strong year from a top and bottom line standpoint being in the range of our long-term goals for Evernorth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: I wanted to ask about strategic capital allocation. And in particular, as you\u2019re looking at care delivery and value-based care, interested in just updates on the priority of that sort of initiative? And then you look at that as more of an enablement and something that could be cross-sold through Evernorth. Or is that also something that could be a driver for your Medicare Advantage, Cigna Healthcare sorts of businesses?\nDavid Cordani: It's David. Relative to the capital allocation and specifically coming to value-based care. And I want to, for a moment, just parse value-based care and care delivery ownership. As it relates to value-based care, we have a very longstanding commitment to and proven track record relative to value-based care. And for us, for starters, that means aligning incentives, leveraging clinical capabilities and working hand in glove with medical professionals to be able to deliver higher, more sustainable outcomes and value than otherwise can be done through a fee-for-service relationship. So today, we have a variety of programs underway with a little less than 50% of the overall equation in commercial being in a value-based care or reward-based configuration, conversely approaching 75% in Medicare Advantage. As it relates to the contribution of that, we see that as contributing to the great medical cost performance that Brian made reference to several times during the call. Now to your capital allocation and ownership configuration our orientation continues to be our preferred approach is to partner with and enable health care delivery systems for the way I just made reference to. However, in addition to that, if in key geographies, we believe the way in which to deliver the sustained outcome and approaches to own physical delivery of care. We will own, but that will be a geographic configuration for physical ownership. Added to that, in consistent, we seek to own care delivery assets that we believe are highly differentiated over the long term in terms of clinical capabilities as well as leverageable multi-geographic or nationally. What do I mean by that? Specialty pharmaceutical, behavioral health care, virtual care delivery are great examples of that. And Lance, going to the last part of your question, those services were more likely than not be Evernorth care capabilities that are offered to Cigna Healthcare commercial or Medicare Advantage, but also offered to the open broad marketplace from that same point and customized to the needs of large stand-alone employers, integrated delivery systems and health line clients. So you should expect as those programs continue to grow, they will be Evernorth care programs offer to Cigna Healthcare, but also offered broadly speaking, to the broad addressable market we have outside of Cigna Healthcare through Evernorth.\nLance Wilkes: And could you just comment on your CareAllies and Cigna Medical Group capabilities? Are those in Evernorth? And would those be kind of integrated in with these sorts of efforts? Or are those focused on something else?\nDavid Cordani: Yes. It's great and credit to sneak a follow-on there. So take the second part of your piece, Cigna Medical Group is now Evernorth Care. It's an Evernorth Medical Group, it's rebranded as Evernorth, so it's the actions and the words line up from that standpoint. CareAllies remains currently focused intensely on the Cigna Healthcare portion in the Medicare Advantage portion and the value-based care relationships within our Medicare Advantage are currently in support of the MA only. So 2 different postures given the gestation of those programs, but the Cigna Co. Group is fully functioning as part of the Evernorth care platform today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. David, most of my questions have kind of been answered. I guess I would come back to the Evernorth segment and focus on the pharmacy network relationships. I guess I would ask, is there anything worth noting or any pressure points there as your pharmacy partners always seem to be under pressure and are looking for us to generate value? As it relates to pharmacy services or clinical value? So I guess just \u2013 it seems like we\u2019ve had stability in pharmacy network relationships for a while. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything there to talk about.\nDavid Cordani: George, it's David. There's nothing unique I would call out. That doesn't mean it's -- nothing is happening. As you referenced, it's a dynamic environment. But there's nothing unique I would call out, and our team continues to work with our pharmacy partners to make sure we get the right balance of access, accessibility, obviously, servicing clinical quality and affordability for our clients and our patients and customers. But no unique pattern or tension point or formation I would call out.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Mr. Ben Hendrix with RBC Capital Markets.\nBen Hendrix: I was wondering to what degree the MLR favorability ex-prior year development is unique within your commercial insured book? I guess I\u2019m wondering if the drivers of that favorability that you noted are also being realized by your ASO customers to the same degree? And to what extent that\u2019s helping retention?\nBrian Evanko: It's Brian. So as I think I mentioned in a prior question, the prior year development was not material to our results in the quarter. So you should kind of take that off of the list here in terms of considerations -- and the majority of the strength in the quarter in the medical care ratio was in the commercial employer book of business, which, by definition, would be the risk-oriented products. To your point, there is extensibility to our self-funded clients of course, because the same programs that are in place for our risk book are also utilized by many of our ASO and self-funded clients and the affordability initiatives span the entire Cigna Healthcare segment in many instances. David, do you want to pick up on the traction with the marketplace?\nDavid Cordani: Just to reinforce the linkage you created, the favorability, yields, lower medical cost trend and therefore, better affordability for our clients and that is a positive contributor to both retention as well as our ability to get responsible rate increases. It's also importantly not only a contributor to retention, when we're able to validate the value we were able to deliver it puts us in a position to deepen relationships, so to broaden services from that standpoint. But the linkage you created was absolutely correct.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: First, thanks for everybody for joining our call today. And just to reiterate a few pieces, we built good momentum through the first quarter and we carried into the second quarter, and therefore, we're confident in our ability to deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.90 for 2022 as well as our increased revenue and customer growth outlook. Additionally, before I close, I want to just pause and recognize and express my personal appreciation to our more than 70,000 coworkers who demonstrate through their continued focus and dedication and support our ability to deliver for all those we have the privilege to serve for our customers, our clients, our patients, our partners and ultimately, to convert that for you, our shareholders. We look forward to talking to you again soon about how we continue to advance our mission of improving health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve and our continued approach to make health care services and solutions more affordable, predictable and simple. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna's Second Quarter 2022 Results Review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's second quarter 2022 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We have delivered strong customer revenue and earnings growth in the first half of 2022. Continuing our momentum from the first quarter, with second quarter earnings per share exceeding our expectations. With that, we are again increasing our full year adjusted 2022 earnings outlook to at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% off of our reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. This updated outlook reflects the strength of our foundational and accelerated growth businesses, coupled with cross enterprise leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include total revenues of $45.5 billion, After-tax adjusted earnings of $2 billion, representing growth of 10% over second quarter 2021 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.22. These results reflect a better-than-expected medical care ratio in Cigna Healthcare and continued strong performance within our Evernorth portfolio. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 7% over second quarter 2021 to $34.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by the expansion of our accelerated growth businesses, led by our high-performing specialty pharmacy as well as a continued focus on affordability by delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments to both sustain and create new sources of differentiation. These include investments which serve to deepen our client relationships, develop new solutions and enhanced digital capabilities to expand our services in the Evernorth Care business. Overall, Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, consistent with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.3 billion, Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.7%. The better-than-expected medical care ratio in the quarter, was the primary driver of Cigna Healthcare's earnings results exceeding our expectations. The strength in our MCR was driven by a combination of strong pricing actions taken over the past 12 months, our continued affordability initiatives to lower cost for our clients and lower-than-expected utilization within the quarter. Non-COVID costs in the quarter were better than expectations across most service categories driven by lower levels in inpatient, emergency room care and surgeries and direct COVID costs were also lower than projected. Importantly, leveraging our customer engagement model, we are seeing preventive care utilization in line with pre-pandemic levels, including items such as annual exams, colonoscopies and mammograms. Turning to medical customers. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 725,000 customers or 4% year-to-date. Our select market segment within U.S. commercial has already grown 6% year-to-date and remains on track for high single-digit growth in customers by the end of the year. Total medical customers for the quarter were above our expectations as we've seen continued growth and strong retention in our U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Overall, Cigna Healthcare results reflect continued execution against our commitment to increasing both customer relationships and profit margins in 2022. The margin improvement reflects our pricing actions and affordability initiatives taken over the course of the past year. For Corporate and other operations, the second quarter 2022 pre-tax adjusted loss was $168 million. Overall, we delivered strong second quarter financial results that exceeded our expectations, continuing our momentum with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, we are increasing our outlook for full year adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings per share. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong execution driving attractive top and bottom line growth, all while investing in innovation for the future. We are now raising our Evernorth full year adjusted earnings to approximately $6.125 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2022, and we are now updating our 2022 medical care ratio outlook to 81.5% to 82.5%, an improvement from our prior range. We are also raising our expected full year 2022 adjusted earnings outlook to approximately $4.025 billion. And we are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 800,000 customers, which includes strong new business growth and attractive retention levels in our foundational U.S. commercial and international health businesses. Turning to enterprise revenue. We now expect full year 2022 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $178 billion. Enabled by continued growth and deepening of customer and client relationships in both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our full year 2022 SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 7.1% to 7.3%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Taken as a whole, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be at least $22.90 per share, representing growth of 12% over reported full year 2021 adjusted EPS. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. Our businesses continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive returns on capital. Year-to-date, as of June 30, 2022, we have repurchased 9.7 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion. Additionally, in July, we received an initial delivery of 10.4 million shares of our common stock in accordance with the accelerated share repurchase we announced in June. We also continue to expect to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases for the full year 2022. We have also increased our outlook for full year cash flow from operations to at least $8.5 billion, generating a very attractive cash flow yield. And we now expect full year weighted average shares of 312 million to 314 million shares, representing an increase of 1 million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to the sale of our international life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses being completed slightly later than we originally had anticipated. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now we would be remiss if we didn't acknowledge the macroeconomic environment, which carries potential risks but also opportunities. We have a strong and resilient enterprise with a diverse service-based framework, spanning broad addressable markets. And our first half results demonstrate the resiliency of our portfolio and strength of our execution in a dynamic environment. We continue to proactively prepare with a variety of actions and tools to respond to evolving economic conditions and we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow and deliver strong value to our customers, clients and shareholders. Now to recap. Results in the second quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong fundamentals across our diversified portfolio, with particularly strong performance in Cigna Healthcare. Evernorth continues to deliver attractive results, while Cigna Healthcare continues to grow and expand both customer relationships and margins, giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $22.90. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Kevin, it's Brian. So thanks for the question on the Cigna Healthcare margin trajectory. Just to maybe rewind the clock a little bit. If you look back at 2021, that part of our business generated a margin of 8.1% which was below our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. And when we stepped back and thought about where we stood in '21, we decided to intensify a series of pricing actions as well as affordability actions in the middle part of the year and the last 12 months have resulted in the strong performance that we saw here in the second quarter of 2022. With our increased 2022 outlook, we're now projecting for the profit margin in Cigna Healthcare to run in the high 8%, just south of 9% relative to our long-term margin goal of 9% to 10%. You should view that as a sustainable place to jump off of. And we would expect, as we step into '23 that we'll be able to deliver within our targeted margin range of 9% to 10% for Cigna Healthcare, but likely at the lower end of that range, given the continued long-term margin opportunities we have in the accelerated growth platforms such as Medicare Advantage. But the stronger-than-expected 2022 performance we've seen increases our overall confidence in executing against our margin goals while also reducing a little bit of the year-over-year opportunity for further margin expansion opportunity in comparison to where we stood a quarter ago. Sure, David. As it relates to pricing in the commercial book of business, this year's 2022 medical care ratio performance has resulted in a higher margin profile for Cigna Healthcare, and that's driven largely by our commercial employer book of business. So we've recaptured a bit more margin in 2022 than we originally anticipated. The good news is that means there's less correction that's needed on a prospective basis. So we'll certainly be pricing to our forward look at cost trend as we head into 2023, but we don't need a meaningful step change as it relates to the commercial employer margin profile. The one nuance in that is our stop-loss portfolio as we talked about in our fourth quarter results did have some pressure in 2021. That pressure has continued at the level we expected in 2022. So as we step into \u201823, there will be a little bit of a reprice on some of those clients but we were able to get, again, more margin recapture here in \u201822 than we had anticipated in the commercial employer book of business. Justin, it's Brian. I'll start and then, David, I think maybe we'll chime in on the headwinds, tailwinds component. At a macro level, you should not think of there being massive amounts of nonrecurring items favorable or unfavorable in the 2022 performance. So you should view the $22.90 is a reasonable jump-off point. As we look back at prior year development, which has been largely in line with prior calendar years, the amount of activity we're seeing in the second quarter, Cigna Healthcare book of business as it relates to fundamental strength is quite high. So meaning there's not any meaningful things we'd call out that are substantial, and that would be 2022 specific for purposes of doing those adjustments at this point in time. That could change as the year unfolds. But broadly speaking, I jump off to $22.90. David, do you think about with a tailwind, do you want to jump in on that, please? Gary, it's Brian. I'll do my best to take each of those components of your question. And I appreciated the lead-in that you started with there. We are really pleased with the strength in the medical care ratio in the second quarter. So and it really was a fundamental strength across the portfolio with our U.S. commercial employer book really being the primary driver of the strength. And as I mentioned earlier in my comments, we saw favorability both in non-COVID and in COVID-related costs in the quarter. So strength in both parts of that portfolio, again, which reflects our affordability initiatives as well as a lesser utilization than we had been forecasting. As it relates to the sequential decline, you should not think of the international health business as a material driver of that. This was really a quarter we had favorable cost experience relative to our prior expectations, as opposed to anything unique or nuanced by adding the international book in there. As it relates to behavioral health, you're right, last year, we saw higher than typical cost trends in our behavioral health book of business, which we actually viewed as a good thing from the standpoint of people getting the care that they needed. That's moderated a bit here in 2022, meaning the cost trends we're seeing on behavioral are lower than they were in 2021. And as a result of that, that's provided a little bit of quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year favorability. And then finally, on your point about stop-loss, as I mentioned on the earlier question that Michael asked, the 2022 stop-loss MCR performance is largely in line with our expectations. So when we reset the 2021 MCR pick at the end of the year, given the pressure we saw, we had said we would not be able to reprice most of the '22 book just given the timing of when that emerged. And so that's our expectation. That's what we're seeing in the actual. So the MCR outlook for '22 and stop off very similar to the MCR outlook for '21, which gives us a repricing opportunity in 2023. So you kind of step back from all of this and the favorability we're seeing in commercial is largely not stop loss related. It's largely related to the non-COVID and the COVID-related cost on first dollar coverages and our fully insured and other risk businesses. It's Brian. So as it relates to the MLR outlook for the back half of the year, so stepping back again in the second quarter, we saw a very favorable result relative to our prior expectations. And if you recall from our first quarter earnings release, we felt that it was prudent to assume that 2022 medical cost performance would look a lot like 2021 when you look at the all-in combined effect of COVID and non-COVID cost. So the terminology, if you recall, we would use the time would be above baseline. For purposes of the back half of the year, we have assumed that the medical cost performance will be largely consistent with our previous planning assumptions, meaning we have not assumed the second quarter favorability will run rate or extend through the back half of the year. So obviously, if the remaining 2 quarters were to run more in line with what we saw in the second quarter, there will be favorability in the second half of the year results from the standpoint of the MCR and as such, the income outlook. We're not yet seeing on the second part of your question, any meaningful signs of pent-up demand or acuity building in the book of business. So as I mentioned earlier, when we look at blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies, all of those on a per capita basis are very much in line with where they were in 2019, and we continue to see things like when cancers present the percentage that are metastatic is very consistent with where it was in 2019. And so the favorability we're seeing in the results, we don't attribute to a meaningful amount of care not being consumed that needs to be. Stephen, it's Brian again. So relative to what we saw in the second quarter MCR, as I mentioned earlier, U.S. commercial was the primary driver of the favorability. Our government products largely ran in line with our expectations. And within the commercial employer book of business, we did have some favorability from first quarter reserve development, but that was the minority of the favorability in the experience. The primary driver were second quarter dates of service running favorable to our projections, which, again, is a function of both lower utilization than we expected, but also the affordability initiatives really holding -- or taking hold in the quarter. So we saw a strong site of care optimization in the quarter and other things such as that, helping to contribute to the favorable results in the quarter. As it relates to repricing for the balance of the year, the smaller part of our business, select segment tends to have a more even renewal date schedule as compared to our national accounts business, which tends to be very heavy 1/1. So you should think of on the select segment, about 2/3 of the clients have 1/1 effective dates and the other 1/3 have effective dates later in the year. So there is some opportunity for us to reprice that business that's been factored into our outlook in terms of the rate actions we have either already secured or intend to secure for the balance of the year. So that's been factored into the outlook and we've been really pleased with the strong execution of our U.S. commercial team. We're delivering both improved margins and net customer growth in a challenging year. Just one add for you, Steven, in terms of the modeling on the revenue side. In 2021, we had relatively steep sequential growth as it relates to the quarterly pattern of Evernorth revenue. A lot of that was driven by the onboarding of specific clients for our specialty programs. associated with the Prime Therapeutics relationship, the 2022 pattern is less steep, which is driving a little bit of the top line deceleration you made reference to. However, we'll see sequential growth in each quarter this year and we're on track for a strong year from a top and bottom line standpoint being in the range of our long-term goals for Evernorth. It's Brian. So as I think I mentioned in a prior question, the prior year development was not material to our results in the quarter. So you should kind of take that off of the list here in terms of considerations -- and the majority of the strength in the quarter in the medical care ratio was in the commercial employer book of business, which, by definition, would be the risk-oriented products. To your point, there is extensibility to our self-funded clients of course, because the same programs that are in place for our risk book are also utilized by many of our ASO and self-funded clients and the affordability initiatives span the entire Cigna Healthcare segment in many instances. David, do you want to pick up on the traction with the marketplace?"

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. In the second quarter, our company continued delivering differentiated value for our clients, customers, patients and partners as we execute on our mission to improve the health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve. And we posted strong results for the quarter and continue to build on our momentum from the first quarter. Now today, I'll briefly discuss our quarterly performance and the key strategic drivers of our growth, then Brian will review additional details about our financial results during the quarter, our increased outlook for the rest of 2002 as well as our strong capital position. and then we'll take your questions. Let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $45.5 million and adjusted EPS of $6.22 per share. Our differentiated capabilities and innovative approaches are resonating in the market, and we achieved another quarter of strong performance across our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we're pleased with the way our solutions are continuing to gain traction with health plans, large commercial employers, governmental agencies, health care delivery systems and medical professionals. Today, more than 180 million individual customers have access to our Evernorth solutions. We're also encouraged by our progress during the selling season for 2023, and we are on track for another year of high client retention levels. In Cigna Healthcare, our disciplined execution is driving a balance of sustained customer growth and continued progress with expanding margins. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 80.7%, which was better than expected and a substantial improvement over the same period last year. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see a positive impact from the targeted pricing and affordability actions we put in place last year and in early 2022. Overall results during the first half of the year, including the strength of our ongoing performance give us confidence in delivering our increased full year 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.90. Additionally, we recently completed the divestiture of our life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in 6 markets across Asia Pacific to Chubb, and we launched a $3.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. At current levels, we view this as an attractive use of our capital. When combined with our previously completed activity, we remain on track to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. Overall, we delivered a strong first half of 2022, and we are positioned to deliver on our increased outlook for revenue, customer growth and EPS for this year. Our performance is a direct result of our ability to leverage our expertise, capabilities and ongoing commitment to innovation, all focused on the most pressing needs of those we serve. Affordability remains first and foremost, a top need for all of our stakeholders. In response to this, we continue to drive target innovations, including, for example, a new solution launched in June that leverages our capabilities at eviCore to support post-acute care for Cigna Medicare Advantage patients. As the patient prepares for a discharge from a hospital, our team draws upon the extensive evidence-based guidelines as well as analytics we have to work closely with providers and patients. The result is that we're able to determine the most appropriate site of care and services to support a patient's recovery, which improves health outcomes, drives meaningful cost savings and provides better patient experience and satisfaction. We've also launched a number of programs that address the rising costs of vital medications. Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth's patient assurance program is an industry-first innovation capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin. In 2021 alone, we provided more than $42 million of financial relief to approximately 220,000 patients with diabetes. We've continued to broaden the impact of this program by expanding it to other chronic conditions drawing on the strength of our expertise as well as our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Building on the success of this program, last month, our U.S. commercial business introduced Cigna Pathwell Specialty, a new approach to specialty care. Pathwell Specialty leverages our specialty capabilities in Cigna and Evernorth and provides enhanced support to patients for better outcomes while also controlling rising specialty costs. We plan to extend this offering to additional groups of clients later this year. At our Investor Day in June, we talked about how we're able to consistently deliver sustained attractive healthy growth even in challenging economic environments. Our company is built to perform in a variety of market conditions, including economic slowdowns. It starts with our growth framework that positions us to expand our addressable markets and capture value in 3 specific ways. First, foundational growth. to our businesses that are mature, scaled and contribute steady predictable results for our company. These businesses currently contribute about 60% of our annual revenue and include Express Scripts, U.S. commercial and our international health business. Second is accelerated growth for our businesses with differentiated capabilities aided by secular trends creating very attractive addressable markets. These businesses represent about 40% of our company's revenues, and we expect to grow these further with momentum from our specialty pharmacy and care services businesses within Evernorth and our U.S. government business in Cigna Healthcare. And third, cross-enterprise leverage, where businesses work together to create value and capture more value than any one of them could achieve on the road. Putting it all together, this growth framework translates into continued strong top and bottom line contributions from Evernorth. Our health service platform continues to providing industry-leading pharmacy solutions while also building out our Evernorth Care capabilities to address the growing demand for behavioral services, health coaching and care delivery. Evernorth strengthens our ability to support customers and clients with the forces facing and reshaping health care today, including the significant societal shift, bringing widespread and growing recognition of the connection between mental and physical health. This has resulted, for example, in a rising demand for services, and we've continued to expand our traditional network. For example, Evernorth behavioral network has more than doubled in size over the past 5 years. We're also supporting enhanced services by providing virtual care. Recently, we launched Confide Behavioral Health Navigator to improve the way we guide people to the right behavioral care at the right setting at the right time. We also have an extensive and growing portfolio of solutions, supporting both virtual and digital first solutions, including our MDLive platform. For Cigna Healthcare, our growth framework translates into strong performance driven by ongoing customer growth in U.S. commercial as we continue to improve affordability in key geographies, including through advancing our value-based care and site of care service programs. Also accelerating Cigna Healthcare's adoption of Evernorth Solutions, which creates even greater value for our customers and clients and as a driver of attractive sustainable revenue growth for Evernorth. In International Health, following the divestiture of our International Life accident and supplemental benefits portfolio, we are intensifying our focus on health and health service offerings. And in U.S. government, both for Medicare Advantage and individual family plans, we are delivering strong value for those we serve while we're investing in markets where we see sustained path for growth and a clear right to win over the long term. This balance and diversified approach to growth, together with our substantial capital generation affords us a significant level of strategic and financial flexibility that positions us for sustained, differentiated growth under a variety of scenarios. Now to wrap up. We delivered on our customer client commitments in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive continued attractive healthy growth across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms by leveraging our portfolio of foundational assets, accelerated growth businesses and fueled by the power of our cross-enterprise leverage. We are encouraged by our strong retention outlook for the start of 2023 as well as new business wins for the start of the year. We remain on track for continued delivery of our commitments. And as a result, we are increasing our full year outlook to at least $22.90 per EPS, which represents a growth rate of 12%, which is within our long-term average annual adjusted EPS growth target of 10% to 13%. We're continuing to deliver significant value for our shareholders, and we expect to deliver at least $7 billion through share repurchase in 2022 as well as continue to pay a meaningful dividend. We also continue to make strategic investments to strengthen our capabilities and broaden our reach in both our foundational and accelerated growth businesses. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. It's David. So yes, is the simple answer. So relative to my comments on the selling season, more specifically focused on the -- both in the Evernorth side of the house, the large employer, a large health plan side of the business. In the commercial side, the national account side of the business. So headline there is on the Evernorth piece of the equation. Another year of strong client retention overall for the portfolio as well as attractive new business wins. I think importantly to underscore as well, we continue to see traction of what we call enterprise leverage. So opportunities to deepen and expand relationships. First, within the traditional Evernorth portfolio, the successful renewal of the DoD also presented the opportunity to win and secure the exclusive specialty services. And then beyond that, we're broadening and deepening relationships with key health plan clients by leveraging the best of Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. On the commercial national account side, we see 2023, looking up to be a very strong retention year and some really attractive new business adds. So good, good performance on both sides of the equation. As Brian noted in his prepared remarks, also just continued strong performance in the commercial side of the Select segment. Josh, it's David. So our Medicare Advantage business remains a key point of focus for us. And as you recall from our Investor Day conversation, we view it as one of our accelerate platforms. So a platform where we have the opportunity for outsized growth over the long term. We continue to make investments in that business, both in the core aspects of the business as well as in the geographic expansion. Our 2022 results are not indicative of what we would expect to see over the long term. And importantly, in your question, which I think you touched upon insightfully one of the pieces, we did a bit of network reconfiguration to put us in some key markets in a position for longer-term growth, where we had attractive network positions, but not growth outlook from that standpoint. Shifting to '23, we would expect a year of growth to reaccelerate for ourselves in the Medicare Advantage business. As we discussed, that date by in geography growth today, existing geographies beginning to leverage the hard work that was done in 2021 and in '22 in terms of geographic expansion. Targeted and further investments in distribution and marketing as well as beginning to harness more yield out of what we think about in terms of our inside or more captive opportunities. Those are commercial agents that we talked about before, where we've had a low conversion rate, our PDP conversions or a med sup conversions. So headline, yes, some network reconfiguration, a lot of that was addressed in this current year, harnessing the benefit of the geographic expansion work that was done and then harnessing some benefits that we would expect to see out of the channels I made reference to. Therefore, we expect 2023 to be a year of growth for us. So as Brian made reference to in the prior answer, I think it was to Kevin's point relative to Cigna Healthcare margins. He referred to the Medicare Advantage margins as being below our target margin. So as we grow the margin in the overall portfolio of business. That business is running at below target margins. We would expect to see margin improvement in 2023, to be very specific off of 2022's results and be able to grow although that portfolio will run below our target margins for a variety of reasons, including our investments in growth initiatives looking forward. But specifically, we expect growth and some margin expansion in that business, yet it will run below our target as we continue to invest in growing that portfolio. As it relates to the second part of your question, and Stars, I think you're identifying the phenomenon for 2024 first off of the present. We feel really good about our present Star configuration and the strong value that, that reinforces that we provide. To look for 2024 seems to indicate that the industry as a whole will have some Stars dislocation for the reasons you articulated. The disaster release configuration, the prolonged impact of COVID, the data transfer that comes across with that and the changes within the disaster release program. So we would expect to have some adjustment to our Stars consistent with what transpires for the industry at large. And obviously, that will become clear towards the latter part of this year for the industry as a whole as well as for ourselves. Michael, it's David. Let me just briefly start and hand it over to Brian. First, to underscore, we're quite pleased with the results. Our teams are executing quite well. And Brian will come across the pricing, but he underscored in his prepared remarks as well, the affordability. It's 2 dimensions working together. So -- it's getting first and foremost, consultatively the right solutions in place, employer by employer within all of our segments, whether they're select segment employers. What the market knows is middle market employers were national account employers and then it's executing the right affordability initiatives to be able to give -- deliver the right value and then executing from a pricing standpoint. So I want to underscore, it's both of those pieces coming together to create the sustainability and our attractive underlying both retention and new business growth, coupled with the margins we're quite pleased with. Brian, I'll ask you to speak a little bit more towards the pricing dimension. It's David. So I think the dimension to your question first on the second piece, we see a very active pipeline. We've seen an active pipeline. As I noted previously, our retention results have been strong and importantly, underscoring even in 2022, commented relative to 23 start. But in '22, our retention results are strong even with the rate execution that Brian made reference to. So good retention within our portfolio, quite an active pipeline across various aspects of our business. On the first part of your question, it's a really long conversation. Let me boil it down. There's no doubt that the environment remains dynamic, disrupted, challenging from an employer standpoint to be able to attract, retain, have the engagement levels for their coworkers. A couple of phenomenons I would underscore to your point. One, in the prolonged pandemic environment, employers are dealing with, call it, the nomadic lifestyle of more of their employees. So first and foremost, on the commercial side, truly having a seamless commercial network for their employees because the higher percentage of the coworkers are consuming care in various locations as opposed to more traditional or centralized locations geographically. Secondly, seeking to advance as aggressively as possible, behavioral health services and the connection of behavioral health services with physical health services. And I highlighted several of those in my prepared remarks. That remains front and center. Third, on the cost and the affordability side of the equation, open-mindedness even push to more aggressively adopt whether they're site of care optimization programs. So how do you get better affordability with existing even improve quality by optimizing site of care for an individual patient or bringing more services closer to the individual, both dealing with the nomadic lifestyle as well as site of care, virtual digital-first, closer intimacy. And those are areas that have been high on strategy for us. So you're correct. There's a lot of dynamism in the marketplace today, being consultative in terms of putting the right solution suite together, mission-critical, having the services between our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare portfolio mission-critical right now and then being able to optimize that national network, the site of care optimization kind of the multimodal virtual coordinated care is mission-critical right now. A.J., I hope that helps. Sure, Brian. Thanks. And Brian, maybe under your point. Therefore, we seldom talk through about a rebasing framework, Justin. As it relates to headwind tailwinds, we would typically go through that in more detail on the third quarter call and then detailed guidance in the fourth quarter call, but maybe a step back to, as you may recall from Investor Day, we talked about a few of the more macro opportunities for 2023. So first and foremost, think about foundational and fundamental growth across our businesses. As we commented today, we would expect another year of growth for the organization, both on the Cigna Healthcare side of the equation as well as Evernorth side of the equation. Secondly, a topic we have not discussed here, but we discussed previously at Investor Day we would expect to see further contributions from the biosimilar trend, which will begin to accelerate 2023, accelerate further in 2024, but some contribution of the biosimilar trend, of which we are well positioned and configured to deliver value for our clients, customers and patients on as well as benefit for our shareholders. On the headwind side, just to give illustrations, we've highlighted set up \u2013 what we call setup costs for very large clients, whether they're very large client renewals or expansions. There's a set of costs in a gestation cycle relative to that. And then lastly, the rate and pace of our strategic investments that we choose to make given the rapid changes in the environment may create a little bit more headwind year-over-year, which we would highlight. But net-net, we would expect another positive year for 2023, off of what is shaping up to be a very strong year for 2022. Lisa, it's David. You packed a lot in there. So let me try to run through them. First, from a retention standpoint, think about 95-plus. We believe anything in the mid-90s plus is a quite strong result given the diversity of our business for that portfolio. And as I noted on the prior comment, in addition to that, think about us continuing to deepen the relationships we have with broadening of services. As I noted, whether it's adding specialty exclusive or otherwise as well as the enterprise leverages, we have some relationships that are becoming deeper with leveraging Cigna Healthcare capabilities for legacy Evernorth relationships or vice versa. But think retention, 95-plus is something that we view as quite attractive. As it relates to the biosimilars, your specific question on formulary that finalization typically takes place as we approach the fourth quarter. So the dynamism being managed through. And as you know, with your background relative to the space, there's a lot of dynamism relative to that as it relates to choice client by client as well. We think about our national preferred formulary finalization more approaching the fourth quarter versus in the current dynamic and time frame. And specific to the timing of the opportunity, as we discussed previously, I would think about the biosimilar acceleration. While there's some movement, obviously, in 2022, '23 is active year with fixation and focus on HUMIRA and the transition. That will begin to ramp in 2000 and contributions will begin to ramp in 2023, but accelerate much further in '24 and obviously going to '25. Lastly, relative to 340B. As folks know, 340B is a really important program that a lot of health care delivery systems benefit from as they serve disadvantaged and underserved populations to help them get the right level of affordability. There's been some dislocation in that program and some pharmaceutical manufacturers have you lately decided to stop or decrease or create tension for health care delivery systems participation in that. As it relates to Cigna specifically through our Evernorth portfolio, it's not a material driver of 2022 results, hence, we didn't call it out. Any change or disruption, and that is not a material driver to 2022 results from that standpoint, although there's been some activity, and we've seen some deceleration in volume as some of the data transfer tension has grown. We've seen that a little bit trough in the second quarter, and we see emergence of some improvement or acceleration in those activities in the beginning of the third quarter here as we work with health care delivery systems to try to help them get the data across that pharmaceutical manufacturers are challenging them to deliver. But again, not a material driver for us thus far, Lisa. Kevin, it's David. You're correct, there's -- once again, some proposed legislation that's manifesting. And in the builders, there's orientation relative to pharmaceutical pricing. Stepping back, big picture, if you look at the breadth and the shape of our Evernorth portfolio as well as the diversification of services we have, both on the core pharmacy services, specialty pharmacy services, the innovation we've been able to bring to the market, the clinical programs we have, the significant amount of transparency we have with clients of a variety of choices. There is no item that we see currently in any of the proposed legislation that we view as a unique or a significant dislocation to our business. That doesn't mean there's not an environment of change. But back to managing the portfolio, the breadth of our services, the continued commitment to innovation, the evolution of our clinical programs, the evolution of our financing and funding mechanisms, affording choice to our commercial clients, health plan clients, et cetera, from that standpoint, positions us as we best see well even with the proposed legislation, and we continue to track the emergence of that day to day. Steven, it's David. Just to the macro level, 2 points. One, we remain quite pleased with the overall performance of Evernorth and the sustained performance within Evernorth. Two, to your point, I give you caution in terms of triangulating any one quarterly pattern. You're correct, the rate and pace of the investments we're making. You made a reference relative to the Q-over-Q revenue growth, a little bit of the lumpiness in terms of the way the revenue manifests itself, for example, in Q1 and Q2 of last year. But the overall revenue trajectory and the overall earnings trajectory is quite helpful. Lastly, kind of pivoting down into your investment piece, we continue to make accelerated and growing investments within our accelerate platforms, 2 of those are within Evernorth, specifically the specialty pharmaceutical business through both Accredo and CuraScripts, but heavily targeted towards the Evernorth Care piece. We showcased some of the direction of that at our Investor Day and you should continue to expect to see us continue to ramp relative to that. So if there's any pattern or outside spending or investments that manifest itself beyond the large client set up costs, it's really the strategic investments we're making within our Evernorth care part of the equation today. It's David. Relative to the capital allocation and specifically coming to value-based care. And I want to, for a moment, just parse value-based care and care delivery ownership. As it relates to value-based care, we have a very longstanding commitment to and proven track record relative to value-based care. And for us, for starters, that means aligning incentives, leveraging clinical capabilities and working hand in glove with medical professionals to be able to deliver higher, more sustainable outcomes and value than otherwise can be done through a fee-for-service relationship. So today, we have a variety of programs underway with a little less than 50% of the overall equation in commercial being in a value-based care or reward-based configuration, conversely approaching 75% in Medicare Advantage. As it relates to the contribution of that, we see that as contributing to the great medical cost performance that Brian made reference to several times during the call. Now to your capital allocation and ownership configuration our orientation continues to be our preferred approach is to partner with and enable health care delivery systems for the way I just made reference to. However, in addition to that, if in key geographies, we believe the way in which to deliver the sustained outcome and approaches to own physical delivery of care. We will own, but that will be a geographic configuration for physical ownership. Added to that, in consistent, we seek to own care delivery assets that we believe are highly differentiated over the long term in terms of clinical capabilities as well as leverageable multi-geographic or nationally. What do I mean by that? Specialty pharmaceutical, behavioral health care, virtual care delivery are great examples of that. And Lance, going to the last part of your question, those services were more likely than not be Evernorth care capabilities that are offered to Cigna Healthcare commercial or Medicare Advantage, but also offered to the open broad marketplace from that same point and customized to the needs of large stand-alone employers, integrated delivery systems and health line clients. So you should expect as those programs continue to grow, they will be Evernorth care programs offer to Cigna Healthcare, but also offered broadly speaking, to the broad addressable market we have outside of Cigna Healthcare through Evernorth. Yes. It's great and credit to sneak a follow-on there. So take the second part of your piece, Cigna Medical Group is now Evernorth Care. It's an Evernorth Medical Group, it's rebranded as Evernorth, so it's the actions and the words line up from that standpoint. CareAllies remains currently focused intensely on the Cigna Healthcare portion in the Medicare Advantage portion and the value-based care relationships within our Medicare Advantage are currently in support of the MA only. So 2 different postures given the gestation of those programs, but the Cigna Co. Group is fully functioning as part of the Evernorth care platform today. George, it's David. There's nothing unique I would call out. That doesn't mean it's -- nothing is happening. As you referenced, it's a dynamic environment. But there's nothing unique I would call out, and our team continues to work with our pharmacy partners to make sure we get the right balance of access, accessibility, obviously, servicing clinical quality and affordability for our clients and our patients and customers. But no unique pattern or tension point or formation I would call out. Just to reinforce the linkage you created, the favorability, yields, lower medical cost trend and therefore, better affordability for our clients and that is a positive contributor to both retention as well as our ability to get responsible rate increases. It's also importantly not only a contributor to retention, when we're able to validate the value we were able to deliver it puts us in a position to deepen relationships, so to broaden services from that standpoint. But the linkage you created was absolutely correct. First, thanks for everybody for joining our call today. And just to reiterate a few pieces, we built good momentum through the first quarter and we carried into the second quarter, and therefore, we're confident in our ability to deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.90 for 2022 as well as our increased revenue and customer growth outlook. Additionally, before I close, I want to just pause and recognize and express my personal appreciation to our more than 70,000 coworkers who demonstrate through their continued focus and dedication and support our ability to deliver for all those we have the privilege to serve for our customers, our clients, our patients, our partners and ultimately, to convert that for you, our shareholders. We look forward to talking to you again soon about how we continue to advance our mission of improving health, well-being and peace of mind of those we serve and our continued approach to make health care services and solutions more affordable, predictable and simple. Thanks, and have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by for Cigna's First Quarter 2022 Results Review. At this time, all callers are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ralph Giacobbe. Please, go ahead Mr. Giacobbe. \nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, Cigna's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Cigna's Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including Cigna's first quarter 2022 financial results, as well as an update on our financial outlook for the year. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, Cigna uses certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of cigna.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2022 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over to David, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results and disclosures. Regarding our results, in the first, quarter we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $37 million, or $0.12 per share, for integration and transaction-related costs. As described in today's earnings release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2022 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated dividends. Also, our full year 2022 outlook assumes that the pending divestiture of Cigna's International life accident and supplemental benefits businesses will close in the second quarter of 2022, but does not assume any impact from other business combinations or divestitures that may occur after today. Finally, I would like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day on June 3 in New York City, where we look forward to sharing our strategy and opportunities for sustained success and growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to David. \nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're off to a very good start to the year, with the first quarter defined by strong results across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, positive momentum and focused execution, all of which are advancing our strategy and driving growth. We're pleased with our performance overall, specifically, with delivering adjusted EPS above our initial expectations. Today, I'm going to keep my comments relatively brief and focus on some of the key drivers of our performance. Brian will then provide additional details about our financial results and our outlook for 2022 and we'll take your questions. Then on June 3, we'll host our Investor Day, we will provide a deeper level of insights relative to our strategic vision, the growth profile of our businesses and differentiated drivers that will deliver sustained attractive growth. So let's jump in. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and $6.01 of adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our strong results this quarter we are now raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance, underscoring our view that we will achieve another strong year of performance for our company in 2022. We also remain on track to generate $12 billion in deployable capital for the year and directing at least $7 billion to repurchase our shares I want to take a minute to thank our team for all their hard work that led disease outstanding results. Our more than 70000 colleagues in the world are committed to delivering our promise in the market day in day out. And as a result expanding our client customer relationships, all of which enables us to grow and deliver strong results for our shareholders. Now let's take a deeper look at Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and the drivers of their performance. Following an outstanding year of growth in 2021, Evernorth maintained momentum with strong top and bottom line results in the quarter, driven in part by the sustained growth of our Accredo and Scripts specialty pharmacy business which continues to represent one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio  The key driver of this performance is the way in which Evernorth is increasingly resonating with a wide range of buyers including employers, health plans, governmental organizations and health care delivery systems. In an environment, we're getting people the right care and treatment at an affordable price is of paramount importance. I spent meaningful time over the past few months meeting with a number of our clients and partners and they consistently point to the attractive breadth and depth of Evernorth's services and expertise. Our clients rely upon these services and expertise to solve the most pressing health care needs. For some clients, this means tapping into the strength of our pharmacy services. Others that meet me are behavioral health support. With others, the unique specialty pharmacy expertise of the table. More and more our clients are seeking our solutions that leverage our broad high-performing portfolio of capabilities. For example, Evernorth recently launched a new provider consult service for patients with cancer. This service leverages our powerful analytics to identify and connect patients to their oncologists to cancer subspecialty experts and designated National Cancer Institute Centers. And this process enables patients to get access to the latest innovations in research with better health outcomes, lower costs and importantly, keeps the patient's care close to home and their family. This service augments our existing suite of oncology solutions including personalized case management, mental health care, financial support services, pharmacy solutions and collaborative partnerships with oncology providers. Additionally, on the strength of our offerings a couple of weeks ago, we announced a new long-term strategic collaboration between Evernorth and Kaiser Permanente. We're drawing utilities across both Evernorth and our Cigna Healthcare platforms in a way that creates new opportunities for serving a broad range of Kaiser's clients and customers. This builds on our successful relationships for example with Prime Therapeutics and the Department of Defense, both of which were recently renewed for extended track periods. Finally, it's still early in the 2022 selling season but we are continuing to see strong demand for our Evernorth services amongst existing and new clients and additional opportunities to deliver even more value, particularly as we expect more biosimilars to come to market over the coming years and we are seeing strong retention in our Evernorth portfolio of businesses. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered a strong start to the year. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 81.5%, which was better than we had projected. This reflects the disciplined and targeted actions we initiated last year to improve our results including implementing new affordability efforts and pricing actions. In US Commercial, we achieved strong membership growth during the quarter with growth across each of our segments. At a time when employers are trying to navigate a complex economic landscape for their businesses and an emotionally taxing environment for their employees, many are turning to us is the right strategic growth partner to improve presenteeism, productivity and health outcomes. Employers tell us that they value the ability of our US commercial teams to partner with them in developing programs that guide employees to the right care at the right place at the right time, programs supporting them and attracting and retaining talent, through strong employer sponsor benefits programs and services, and programs providing greater predictability in managing financial risk for the companies while optimizing their cash flow during these uncertain times. Our International business also contributed to our growth during the quarter as it achieved higher customer retention and membership growth levels. We also remain on track with the divestiture of our International life, accident and supplemental benefits business in certain countries to jump. With our sharpened focus on health services, we continue to see attractive opportunities for serving multinational employers, governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and the globally mobile population. In our US government business, enrollment was down as expected as we prioritize margin expansion and completed the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. We continue to take actions to position our government business for growth in 2023 and over the long-term. Now to wrap up. Our first quarter results are strong. They underscore the momentum we're building as we serve the evolving needs of our customers and clients as well as continue to drive growth and margin improvement in our company. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.01 and we continue to make strategic investments in our business while paying a meaningful dividend and remaining on path to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. With focused execution we are demonstrating our ability to navigate and lead through this continued dynamic environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. As David noted, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year, as first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations. This performance combined with our continued momentum give us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% off of our reported 2021 EPS. Looking at the first quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights, include adjusted revenue growth of 8% to $44.1 million, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.01. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 10% to $33.6 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, both in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and a continued focus on delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments for the expansion of client relationships, as well as a new solution development and digital capabilities. These investments ensure the continued differentiation of our scaled Evernorth businesses and support the expansion of our Evernorth Care capabilities. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well, with attractive top and bottom line growth, in line with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes our US commercial, US government and retained international health businesses. We ended the year prioritizing margin expansion, having taken targeted pricing and affordability actions during 2021 for impact in 2022. We also expected to drive customer growth in each of our US commercial market segments and we're pleased with how we started the year. For Cigna Healthcare overall, first quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.4 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.5%. The medical care ratio was better than our expectations in the quarter, primarily due to lower COVID testing and treatment costs. In January, COVID incidence was at its highest level throughout the pandemic, but case counts dropped significantly in February and March. Importantly, even during the January Omicron peak, we observed substantially lower severity than earlier in the pandemic and subsequently lower treatment costs. In total, Cigna Healthcare's earnings exceeded our expectations, driven by the favorable medical care ratio, strong specialty contributions and net investment income on our alternative asset portfolio. Net medical customer growth in Cigna Healthcare was also strong, as clients and customers continue to recognize the differentiated value we bring as a partner through our consultative approach and our innovative solutions. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of 4%, or approximately 700,000 customers sequentially. This growth was driven almost entirely by an increase in fee-based customers. Notably, we grew across all of our US commercial market segments and in International health. US government enrollment decreased, as expected, inclusive of the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2022. For Corporate and Other Operations, the first quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $117 million. Across the enterprise, we delivered strong first quarter financial results with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, our strong start gives us the confidence to increase our full year earnings per share outlook, as I will detail in a moment. At Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance with both top and bottom line growth in line with long-term targets, all while continuing to invest in growth and innovation. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers, while expanding margins over 2021. We are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 725,000 customers and reaffirming our 2022 medical care ratio outlook of 82% to 83.5%. For Cigna Healthcare in total, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.95 billion. Taken as a whole, we are raising our EPS guidance and now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% over our reported 2021 earnings per share. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive return capital. In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.12 per share. And year-to-date as of May 5, 2022, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. For full year 2022, we continue to expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations and to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases. We now expect full year weighted average shares of 310 million to 314 million shares, an increase of two million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to our updated expectation for the timing of closing the international divestiture. We now expect this to occur later in the second quarter impacting the timing of our anticipated share repurchase. As a reminder, the financial performance of this business is included within Corporate and Other operations until the divestiture is complete. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver strong top and bottom line growth in line with our expectations, while Cigna Healthcare has had a strong start to the year giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.60. I look forward to continuing to discuss our performance, our strategy and our long-term financial outlook with all of you at our upcoming Investor Day on June 3. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Borsch: I guess I was wondering if you could just talk to the gain on ASO enrollment, and how you saw the national account selling season, so I gather that probably as much from middle market as it is from large employers. Can you just talk to that?\nDavid Cordani : Matthew, good morning, it's David. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased with the start of the year and our full year outlook relative to our commercial portfolio. And the commercial portfolio performed very well across each of the segments National Accounts, Middle Market and our Select segment. And as Brian noted our growth is essentially all ASO self-funded services with our appropriate specialty services are attached to it. I'd highlight a few things. One, strong retention across the block of business. So, we're sought to move forward with some pricing in some of the segments. Two, we've further deepened relationships and we had some wonderful new business adds across the portfolio and notably within the Middle Market. So, headline there is some very good strength across the board from both retention as well as new business adds. And as you noted essentially all self-funded which as you know we really appreciate the self-funded opportunities because we have good alignment, good transparency, and ongoing collaboration with our clients around the program development and the we're able to deliver. \nMatthew Borsch: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Borsch. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on that a little bit. Would just love to get a better sense of how that retention rate for vital business compared to previous years. And then as you look at the growth that you saw I guess would love to hear a little bit about any color you have on the split between in group and new clients? And then, I guess, how you think about the sustainability of that growth given where you are in the process of rebuilding margin in the stop-loss product? Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Sure Stephen, good morning. It's David. So, a couple of dimensions to your question. First broadly speaking the retention rate -- and I would note that we were quite pleased with the retention rate across the portfolio but specifically in the Select segment where we pushed for a little bit further rate execution on the guaranteed cost or risk side of the portfolio even without our retention rate was a bit stronger than we anticipated showing that our product and our portfolio continues to resonate. Secondly, an ice mix of obviously, retention to achieve the growth we have. We have to have new business growth. That's both in existing relationships expanding to new geographies or subsets of portfolios and new business adds. I highlight as we talked in the prior quarter a very nice large win which shows up in our Middle Market portfolio because it's a locally dense relationship that was achieved through an excellent collaboration between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare where we had a large long-standing high-performing Evernorth relationship that we're able to introduce the Cigna Healthcare portfolio to and grow from that standpoint. So, retention a bit stronger I would call out the select segment great work that that team is doing retention is strong across the board and new business adds in each of the segments both in existing relationships and new relationships that we added. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Mr. Lake your line is open, you may ask your question. Please test your mute feature. We'll go on to the next question. The next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on Evernorth. Nice revenue performance in the quarter, it sounds like specialty continues to be a tailwind. I guess for the year, can you maybe talk about where the gains in specialty are coming from? Is that, kind of, continuation of maybe some new exclusive relationships on that side? And then given the revenue strength, we didn't quite see flow through to the bottom line. It looks like expenses might have been a little bit higher there. And David and Brian, I think you mentioned some investments. Are those more one-time, or should we think about that as sort of the run rate for SG&A in that segment? Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. Let me take the first part of your question, and I'll ask Brian to take the second part of your question. As you called out, the specialty performance within Evernorth continues to be quite strong. We're really pleased with the performance of our overall portfolio, and specifically specialty as you know. I'd remind you that, our specialty portfolio, serves multiple segments. Specifically, Accredo Think about that as serving individual direct patient needs on a highly focused basis, including in-home care coordination where appropriate, and Scripts supporting medical professionals by delivering the right drug at the right time for purposes of their services and their needs. I'd also note that, as you would expect, our team is quite excited about and well positioned for the accelerating biosimilar trend that we see in front of us for the coming years. And we're success in the biosimilar space will require not only strong performing specialty capabilities in terms of the breadth of the specialty capabilities, but high coordination on the medical side of the equation, because those decisions as you know are typically made one patient at a time in terms of coordinating the transition of care, where appropriate, unless there's a perfect match from that standpoint. So strength in both the consumer part of our specialty portfolio, as well as the healthcare professional part of our specialty portfolio, and well positioned for evolving biosimilar acceleration as we go forward leveraging our specialty capabilities as well as our medical capabilities. I would not call out any unique drug class changes as a driver of growth, but let me transition to Bryan to expand on that and the second part of your question. \nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Nathan. So in terms of the expense growth in the quarter for Evernorth vis-\u00e0-vis the revenue growth, and how thinking about the full year there. As you noted, the SG&A was up 13% quarter-over-quarter Evernorth, while the revenue was up 10%. You can think of the expense growth is predominantly fueling future growth within Evernorth. So I mentioned earlier, we're making strategic investments to build out our Evernorth Care platform. When you think about Care management, Care coordination Care delivery, alternate sites of Care. We talked to you about virtual care in the past behavioral health in home care. We're making a series of investments there. That won't just be limited to the first quarter. There will be a multi-year investments to continue to diversify our health services portfolio within Evernorth. But for the full year, importantly, our income for Evernorth will be up 5% from where it was in 2021, and our revenue will be up in that same general zone. So you should not think of margin erosion transpiring for the full year even though expenses grew a bit faster than revenue within the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. Good morning. I was interested in the announcement you mentioned around the cancer console service launch. And can you speak to who the targets are for that product? Is that an internal sales process to your existing health plans? And I guess, more importantly, are there other physician enablement services that you think you can add in the future through Evernorth?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, good morning, it's David. First, relative to the space and really appreciate you re-amplifying the oncology opportunity. As we know, the volume of oncology needs in the United States other markets as well but in the United States continues to grow. And we're really pleased with the innovation that is taking place. So we're taking an analytical approach to identify individual patients. So the target market are individual patients that we serve today. So think about that through either Cigna Healthcare and our diversity in healthcare relationships. And increasingly going forward, a service that we'll be able to be offered to our Evernorth health playing clients as an example as a consult to bring that level of precision, identify individual patients who in coordination with their specific oncologists so analytical matching of the patient their oncologist where we determine that by matching them to a center of excellence and bringing the consult precisely back to the patient with their oncologists we could advance quality, affordability and the overall care equation without in many cases needing to have the patient transport themselves to the center of excellence. So it's an example of bringing the Precision two by using the data and the care coordination and our partnerships. So the target audience is individual patients largely through our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, through the rollout that's taking place right now but increasingly as in Evernorth service be able to be offered to our health plan clients and others. And then secondly, if I heard your \u2013 the latter part of your question correctly, think about these types of approaches as indicative and we talk about what Brian made reference to in terms of Evernorth Care, opportunities to again curate and coordinate more of the Care equation, using data and then the breadth of care to bring more services forward. And we'll seek to provide some additional insights relative to at our Investor Day some additional programs that we'll be rolling out in this year not oncologic waste but taking a similar harnessing of data and real-time service delivery. Really appreciate your question.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Sure this is another topic that you're going to be delving into more at Investor Day. But just interested from this point in time, as we look out to 2023, if you could just give us some updates on how you've been looking to refresh the strategy for MA to resume growth in the market for 2023, especially now that we've got the final rates out which clearly looks pretty solid for the industry? \nDavid Cordani: Scott, good morning. You're right we will cover that in June, but let me just profile the broader direction. First and foremost, we continue to see our government segment and specifically within that Medicare Advantage as a very attractive sustained growth opportunity. In 2022, we're in year three of our expansion and growth initiative. And while clearly 2022 was well short of our specific growth algorithm for a variety of reasons including market conditions. Our three-year average growth was just a bit below our low end of our strategic range. Now specific to 2023, we are building our plans and initiatives, specifically to drive attractive growth in 2023. We'll profile a little further. We'll leverage our strong stars positioning, our NPS positioning and our overall medical cost in our targeted MSAs. And I would remind you that we're largely an individual HMO and individual PPO oriented organization. Two, we will demonstrate at Investor Day but we'll \u2013 our plans are building on harnessing now some of the investment we've made in terms of our market expansions over the last couple of years, whereby the early yield traction on market expansion is low in year one. But by the time you get out to year three, we have higher expectations, targeted investments in marketing and distribution. And then importantly, we expect in 2023 to begin to realize more yield off of our commercial agent population and PDP and med sup conversion opportunities that's in front of us. So specifically, our expectations will be and we're building our plans around an attractive growth year for 2023.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclay. Your line is open. You may ask your question. One moment please.\nSteven Valiquette: Yeah. Thanks. Yes. Good morning everybody. So regarding the medical cost trends, is there any further color around the pace of traditional non-COVID utilization trends versus baseline exiting the first quarter and into the second quarter? Also I'm curious, was there any thought to narrowing the top end of the MLR guidance range of 2022, just given the better-than-expected 1Q MLR results? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, I'll try to tackle both of those questions here. In terms of the medical cost performance in the first quarter, as I noted earlier, we saw some favorability come through in the form of COVID costs in particular compared to our expectations in the first quarter. So both testing and treatment came in a bit favorable to what we had been forecasting for the first quarter of the year. And that was true across the commercial book of business in the most pronounced fashion, but in totality for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to non-COVID, the non-COVID costs came in essentially right where we were expecting them to, meaning, if you look at it on a cost trend basis, the cost trends compared to the first quarter of 2021 we're very much in line with our expectations in terms of seeing a normal kind of low-to-mid-single-digit type cost trend on the non-COVID services. We're not really seeing any signs of acuity spikes or pent-up demand, emerge things like blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies are all in line with where they were in 2019, on a per capita basis. And for that matter really were in 2021 as well. So non-COVID shaping up very much in line with what we had been expecting coming into the year. As it relates to the full year outlook for the medical care ratio, you're right we reaffirmed the 82% to the 83.5% range, despite the first quarter coming in a bit favorable. We felt like just being one quarter into the year. This was a prudent thing for us to do and a prudent posture to take given there's three more quarters and respecting that COVID had a lot of twists and turns over the past couple of years. But it would be reasonable to assume the midpoint of our range maybe shading slightly towards the lower half of the range, as you were thinking about where the full year is likely to shake out based on what we've seen so far.\nSteven Valiquette: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: HI everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about the biosimilar opportunity. I know that is out there, but it's a little bit difficult to quantify what it might look like. I guess, can you give us any update on ongoing discussions you're having with the various players? And whether that's provided any clarity? And in your mind, do you think you will get a sense of what the opportunity might be both for Evernorth and I guess, to some degree even with the benefits business?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, A.J., it's David. In some ways it's early -- in other ways, the trend is upon us right? We're seeing the convergence which is a net positive. We think it's a net positive from a -- standpoint relative to the opportunity to further improve affordability. And given our Evernorth model, we have the services with Evernorth and some leverage relative to Cigna Healthcare to really harness this opportunity on a go-forward basis. We don't think there's a single influent point that exists. Maybe that's inferred in your comment. So it's not as though 2023 or 2025 is the single year, we see a ramping of activity. And our teams as you would expect are working class-by-class, drug-by-drug with manufacturers as well as with the programs that we will have in place. And the choices we will be able to offer our clients. I think, very importantly, the consultative nature of the way Evernorth supports our clients will be even more pronounced and more beneficial with the biosimilar trends, as it evolves. As you would expect, given the energy we have relative to our specialty portfolio and its respective traction, this will be an area we\u2019ll seek to amplify a bit more specifically at our Investor Day. But suffice to say, there's not a singular inflection point, 2023 is an important year, with some convergence, but 2024, 2025 begin to ramp and beyond. So we're well positioned relative to that, to improve affordability for our clients and customers and have Evernorth benefit from the value it's creating for our clients, customers and patients.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit more about PBM, when we look at the adjusted claims down 2% year-over-year. A couple of questions. I don't think vaccines were yet material to the prior year. So I just wanted to see if that was mostly just the health plan losses impacting that. It wasn't related to vaccines. And then a few months ago, when you were asked about PBM selling season, obviously, it was very early, it's still early, but you had said you expected at least similar, if not, better retention than 2022, which I think was mid-90s. I just wanted to see if there was any update to that thinking?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Gary. It's David. Let me start and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth framework and why Scripts are, I think, an important example, but given the breadth of Evernorth, no longer the sole example that you should be looking at. Specific to your framing, relative to the current year, broadly speaking, I think, your walk-in faming is right. There was -- we had a little lower retention rate than our historic average and clearly, lower than our phenomenal 2019 and 2020 retention level from that standpoint. Your question, I think, goes to 2023 and as I noted we're positioned to have another strong growth year for 2023 for Evernorth, both on a new business and on a renewal basis. Now specific to PBM, before I transition over to Brian, to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth, we're right at about a 90% visibility. So about 90% of the books already renewed, which is good at this point, in time of the year and we feel quite strong relative to that. And as we sit here right now, specific to the PBM portion of Evernorth, which is what you're asking about, we expect our retention to be higher than 2022\u2019s retention level and revert back to more of the historic norm of 95% or a bit better from that standpoint. But importantly 90% of the book is renewed and we still have some active selling that sits in front of us right now, because the marketplace continues to be pretty fluid in the current environment. Brian?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Gary. Back on the first part of your question in terms of the first quarter 2022 Scripts volumes and such. I think your macro conclusion is right in terms of the Scripts being down 2% is largely a function of the client wins and losses and the net effect of that. The vaccines were pretty flat year-over-year. If you look at the first quarter of 2022 versus first quarter 2021, within 1 million or so Scripts, so that's really not a material driver quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, though, as David, into that, here, as each day passes, the total script count metric becomes less and less important to measuring Evernorth's overall performance. And what do I mean by that is, we have more and more volume coming through our specialty pharmacy, as we have more and more volume coming through our Care platform, you're going to see more earnings and more revenue associated with things that are not directly linked to Scripts. So, as an example, within Specialty, Specialty just crossed over the 35% mark in terms of contribution to overall Evernorth revenue, but it represents less than 1% of our overall prescription volume. So, over 35% of the revenue, less than 1% of the prescriptions. So again, just that metric, I would encourage you to gradually move away from when you're looking at the health of the Evernorth business in totality.\nGary Taylor: Yes. I mean the revenue performance supports it. So, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. David, I just want to follow-up on Evernorth care capabilities? And how you think about MDLIVE sitting into that? And there's been some pressure in the market when we think about behavioral health. And I've heard you talked so many times about whole person health and really thinking about the integration of the two. But -- how do we think about how Ginger fits into that? And how we think about again Evernorth Care capabilities overall when we think about your offerings going into 2023?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, Lisa. Good to chat with you this morning. So, there's a couple of different I think flavors to your question. Let me try to be succinct as I can with them. First, the whole person health or the coordination of care and services remains mission-critical and as we've learned as a society has been amplified in this COVID environment. So first, by way of background, we continue to expand access to behavioral services, whether it's expanding a network in a traditional sense, whether it's expanding behavioral services through virtual care, whether it's being the first have virtual care capabilities, be covered as in-network services through the likes of Ginger. But then, the next step is how do you coordinate point solutions like that and bring them together. And so, let's walk that across MDLIVE. MDLIVE is a great example, and we couldn't be more pleased by having that asset as part of the company to be able to innovate off of, because MDLIVE underscores as a symbol our view and commitment that harnessing technology and data to bring more services on a real time highly personalized basis to a patient or individual, presents one of the biggest opportunities in front of our society for the coming years. And specifically, as you take virtual care and you coordinate medical, behavioral, pharmacy services, et cetera and coordinate those services, patients benefit at a significant level. As we click it down another notch, we've seen some disruption in the marketplace, but I would remind you that our model is not a B2C model dependent upon B2C activation only building off of a triage of it. Or is more B2B and then cultivating the relationship with the customer, whether it's through an employer, a health plan or a health care professional organization and then, end with a fact to underscore our MDLIVE volumes year-over-year Q1 2021 versus Q1 2022, we're up about 29%. So an area where we have significant conviction being able to again coordinate point solutions as opposed to just push point solutions and having it, be highly patient-centric in real time represents a tremendous opportunity and we're pleased with our progress thus far.\nLisa Gill: And I'm sure you're going to answer this at the Analyst Day, David but really, the second part of my question was how do we think about this opportunity in 2023? Do you feel that this is driving a bigger market opportunity for you? I know you talked earlier about the cross-sell of Evernorth with Cigna Health but -- any kind of number of a market opportunity you can put around this?\nDavid Cordani: Yes. So Lisa, I'm sorry, I didn't touch upon that. And you're right we will touch upon that at Investor Day. So, I'll just try to what your appetite by saying, absolutely, we see tremendous opportunity. So, when you think about it, the leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare's portfolio, we already have significant proof points and traction relative to that, and there's more opportunity that Eric and our colleagues will walk through when we're at Investor Day. But importantly those services are not limited to Cigna Healthcare, everything we're building within Evernorth is built with an eye toward, yes Cigna Healthcare as a client to improve quality and affordability and we'll walk through proof points relative to that. But simultaneously to be able to bring it to market to stand-alone employer relationships that minor serves, our health plan clients integrated delivery systems et cetera on a go-forward basis. So we see that addressable market underscoring your point to be quite broad, quite large in terms of what we're building and the ability to improve affordability, personalization and clinical quality, whether it's for Cigna Healthcare or other relationships present a tremendous opportunity and we will amplify that Investor Day.\nLisa Gill: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Austin Gerlach with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. This is Justin Lake. Did I get in this time?\nDavid Cordani: Justin you're live, but you have different names. So you have an alias this morning. It's good to hear your voice.\nJustin Lake: Well, since I can't figure out the mute function I probably should change my name. So look I want to squeeze in two quick questions here just numbers based. One, can you give us a little color on how the rise in interest rates that we're seeing out there could affect you over the next year or two from an earnings perspective? And secondly any help on earnings seasonality in terms of first half, second half would be appreciated? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Justin it's Brian. So in terms of interest rates, the macro conclusion you should draw as you think about Cigna is directionally positive when interest rates move up, but also not terribly material in the grand scheme of things in terms of the direct quantifiable impact. The majority of our balance sheet whether you look at the asset side or the liability side and fixed rate longer-term instruments and those that are shorter term in nature or carry a variable rate. We tend to have on a net basis slightly more exposure on the asset side than the liability side, which creates some favorability in terms of the investment income spread and such. So -- but to mentioning it you shouldn't think of this as terribly material. It's in the call it $20 million to $30 million range annually if you were to look at a 100 basis point move in, in rates order of magnitude. As it relates to the earnings seasonality and I'll talk in EPS terms. Given the strength of the first quarter, you should think of the overall first half of the year is generating about half or roughly half of the full year earnings per share emergence. And then in the back half of the year, we tend to see the fourth quarter as a lower point relative to the third quarter just given the seasonality in the Cigna Healthcare book of business where deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums tend to be met more frequently. So you should think of third quarter being a little bit stronger than the fourth quarter.\nJustin Lake: Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question.\nKevin Caliendo: Hi. I just wanted to get a little bit more information on the Kaiser partnership. How that came about? What does it mean? How meaningful can it be? Where can it go in the future?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning Kevin, it's David. Before we get into the Kaiser opportunity, which I will. I remind you that, we talk about a strategic imperative in the company that we referred to. Our objective as we seek to be the undisputed part of choice. Why do we say that? Because we're guided by a tenant that suggests that if we could identify alignment with potential partners, which I'll come back to Kaiser, we could have the opportunity together to create more value. More reach, more service, more affordability, more clinical quality. So specific to Kaiser that fits into the category and we could not be more excited and pleased with the opportunity to partner up with Kaiser It represents a multiyear strategic relationship where we together can improve access value and affordability.  And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it builds on a successful track record with organizations like Prime Therapeutics where we'll look at a totally different organization with the Department of where we successfully renewed both Prime Therapeutics in the Department of Defense and expanded relationships are recently UPMC et cetera. So it's an orientation, relative to collaborating in a different way and leveraging not only Evernorth's capabilities but in many cases the Cigna Healthcare capabilities. So as it relates to the core of your question in 2022, I would not view it as a major top line or bottom driver given the size and breather Corporation. But as we've proven with other relationships we see it as an opportunity that will have significant and attractive growth over the coming years as we collaborate together and co-innovate together for both top line and bottom line which will be reinforcing of growing in relationships. So I'd ask you to put in the category of a an orientation and a long track record of successful partnerships and we could not be more pleased to partner up with Kaiser and build some shared capabilities and innovation to serve clients and customers with better affordability and reach make clinical quality.\nQ \u2013 Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks so much\nOperator: Thank you Mr, Caliendo. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go into the guidance a little bit. The Q1 beat was a bit stronger than what the guidance increases. I was wondering if you could help us think about how much of the outperformance was just timing versus you using the outperformance to invest in some of the growth initiatives versus any new kind of offsets in the back half of the that you might be thinking of? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin it's Brian. So obviously, we're really pleased with having such a strong start to the year. One thing I would note is, I saw some of the early headlines here in the morning. Our own expectations were a bit higher than consensus for the first quarter. So we had a slightly different quarterly pattern as you think about the magnitude of the first quarter beat. Now we were ahead of our own expectations as I mentioned earlier as well, but just not to the same tune as where I think -- the Street had come in for the first quarter expectations. But as you think about the balance of the year there's really nothing specific I would call out in terms of things that will reverse later or looming issues that might emerge in the second half of the year as you alluded to. We just feel this is a prudent posture to take being just one quarter into the year to raise by $0.20. And keep in mind that's an at least $22.60 EPS expectation for the year. As always, we'll also evaluate additional strategic investments as the year unfolds and digital capabilities and other technology that we're looking to bring to market. But again, there's nothing in particular I'd flag as you think about the balance of the year.\nKevin Fischbeck: Is the $0.20 guidance range more in line with the beat in the quarter versus your own expectations, or is there still some conservatism or investment spend delta? \nBrian Evanko: Yes. As I said earlier, we think this is just a prudent move at this point in the year we release in particular with Cigna Healthcare being above our expectations. \nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Thanks\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking this question. I'm going to ask a couple more about Evernorth. Brian, you talked about specialty being 35% of revs less than 1% of Rx. Is any chance you'd give us the adjusted OP contribution? And then David, I would ask you, as it relates to PBM, while we're not seeing a lot of movement at the national level we're tracking a bunch of state regulatory initiatives, which could seem to have a negative impact on the PBM business profitability there. I guess, would just love how you're thinking about that and if you're seeing anything that's kind of raising the caution flag internally that we should be thinking about?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, George, it's Brian. I'll start on the first point, and then David will pick up on the second. As you about our specialty pharmacy business, again, we continue to be really pleased with the performance over a multiyear period here, we've had really attractive top and bottom line growth and with biosimilars coming, it will provide some further fuel as we look forward. Directionally, you should think of the margin profile on the specialty pharmacy as we not tremendously different than the overall segment just, if you were to sum up to date. But importantly, there's some scrambled eggs, if you will when you think about many of our client relationships are not specific to just specialty or just PBM or just mail order. So we tend to get overall client profitability and not just necessarily one silo within ever north. But you shouldn't think of it as being terribly different than the overall segment margin profile. David, do you want to pick up on the second piece of George's question?\nDavid Cordani: Sure, George. No doubt, the environment has remained active. As you noted from a state, as well as federal standpoint, we do not see any one item, I think underlying your question do we see any one item or one theme as a de-railer relative to our business strategy or capabilities? No. And more macro, we are aligned around initiatives that seek to further improve affordability. All aspects of what we do day in day out within our pharmacy services portfolio, are to drive the right level of differentiated affordability, of course, with clinical and service quality always matched up against that, and we're quite proud of what we've been able to do. And I would note, just as an example, it seems like just yesterday, but it's actually three years ago, we launched our patient assurance program for insulin customers. And today, we have 10 million customers in the patient assurance program just three years later. And the patient assurance program was uniquely designed at that time, and still differentiated in the marketplace. The caps a 30-day outlay for an individual customer at $25. So more broadly to your question, it is active. We do not see any one item as a rally relative to our strategy rather the breadth of our services, capabilities, funding, mechanisms and our approach relative to integrating services we see as creating more opportunities than not as we seek to innovate and redefine the way we're able to bring those services to market.\nGeorge Hill: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. The next question comes from Ms. Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nRicky Goldwasser: Hi. Yeah. Hi, good morning. So there are two quick ones here. First of all David, as we think about sort of your care delivery strategy of primary care any \u2013 given where sort of market value anchors are now any appetite to complement your current assets with M&A, or do you think that you have the \u2013 what you need in terms of assets? And from now on you're going to build organically? And then just on the biosimilar, specifically, HUMIRA it's dispensed by the specialty pharmacy. When we think about biosimilar introduction and the bioequivalent in 2023? Is this embedded into your long-term target adjusted earnings growth of 4% to 6% for Evernorth, or does it represent some upside optionality depending on how the market plays out? \nDavid Cordani: Ricky, good morning, it's David. I'll take your first question. I'll ask Brian to take your second question. Specifically, the first question comes back toward care delivery and I think underscoring that is primary care delivery in the marketplace. Our orientation today relative to care delivery more broadly is we seek to own and differentiate in target areas within care delivery. Those areas include virtual care, specialty pharmacy care and services aspects of behavior health care and services, aspects of home health care services. We see these as sustainable differentiated services that can be leveraged and coordinated. And in many cases function on a nationalized basis or a more seamless basis across multiple geographies. As it relates to physical primary care outside of say, virtual care, which would have primary in it, but physical primary care our stated strategy remains, we seek to partner with and enable health care professionals with aligned incentive models in our care coordination services and that continued to perform -- that strategy has continued to perform very well for us both in a capital-light service orientation, but in the shared collaboration as underscored by our sustained differentiated medical cost trend in clinical quality and NPS we've been able to deliver. Lastly, I would say, Ricky that as we've noted in the past, we are willing to own as we do in a select MSA in the Southwest. We are willing to own primary care physical assets. If we conclude that the only way to get the right balance of affordability access and quality is through ownership, but our preferred approach is again to partner and enable and that has served us well for quite some time, while we seek to differentiate ourself in virtual specialty pharmacy behavioral and home care. Brian, I'll ask you to pick up on Humira.\nBrian Evanko : Good morning, Ricky. So in terms of biosimilars and how we think about Humira relative to the long-term 4% to 6% expectation, we're at a bit of an inflection point right now, because we're getting ready for some acceleration in the biosimilar market as you know over the next two to three years. And David talked about this in response to an earlier question. But even Humira alone and Stelara, those two drugs by themselves represent about 20% of total specialty spend. So the next two to three years will be very telling in terms of how much interchangeability comes to market, how much we're able to move customers over, et cetera. And we're very excited about the prospect to generate affordability for benefit of our clients and customers, and ultimately capture a piece of that value in terms of our economic model. It will be just four weeks from today. Actually we have our Investor Day. And in that time period Eric Palmer is going to spend a little more time talking about biosimilars and how that links into our financial picture. So I don't want to necessarily front-run that conversation, but we'll give you more detail at that time in terms of how to think about that contextually in the sense of our longer-term Evernorth growth expectations.\nOperator: Thank you, Goldwasser. Our final question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.\nDave Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a two-parter on commercial membership. I'm wondering if consolidation of slice business is a theme in your target customer base if you're seeing that and if is or can be a beneficiary of that? And then I'm also wondering as Medicaid redeterminations turn on, presuming they do, can Cigna be a beneficiary or catch Medicaid members moving into commercial, or is that difficult because you don't have them in the Medicaid book?\nDavid Cordani: Dave, good morning, it's David. I'll take both your questions. First, I would not call out the slice phenomenon, whether it's slicing or consolidate as a major driver specifically, as it relates to 2022. The phenomenon transpires as clients look for additional value, and as they seek additional value. I'd underscore though a little bit of a subset here that may be inferred in your question. As we've all learned throughout the prolonged pandemic where people live and work continues to be more fluid than ever. Hence having the seamless network access care coordination and service capabilities that are truly national, and again, seamless remains a differentiator. And like a few -- I'm not going to say, Cigna is no one like a few that proposition I think is even more important today than ever before in terms of supporting the marketplace. But I would not call it the slice phenomenon is unique. As it relates to the Medicaid redeterminations first in our 2022 outlook or our multiyear strategy stand today we do not have a big uptake that would be planned for relative to redeterminations. We do think we'll be a net beneficiary. There'll be some that plays through. And whether it shows up in our IFP or exchange business or in our commercial portfolio through the mechanisms in which people access care or services we do believe that we'll see some opportunity in it but we do not have that factored into our outlook. And we do not believe that you have to be a Medicaid player to benefit from that. We've seen seamlessness of individuals moving over a prolonged period of time even pre-pandemic between programs. So that phenomenon as it relates to the redetermination and the way in which people seamlessly move between either Medicaid and exchange or whether they move between Medicaid through a redetermination now to a broader commercial population we do not see Medicaid as a gate. So that presents some potential upside for us going forward. \nDave Windley: Fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Windley. I'll now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks. \nDavid Cordani: Again thank you for joining our call today. Just to reinforce a few points, we achieved strong results in the first quarter and we're stepping into the rest of 2022 with momentum. We're confident that we will deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.60 for 2022. Our performance is a direct result of the hard work, dedication and passion of our more than 70,000 coworkers across our company who work every day to change people's life for the better. Our actions are also guided by our drive to make healthcare more affordable predictable and simple for our clients and our customers as well as our patients. We look forward to talk to you more next month at our Investor Day about our vision for the future and the progress we're making in driving a meaningful impact for those we serve as well as our long-term sustained growth outlook. Hope you have a great rest of your day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes Cigna's first quarter 2020 results review.

            "content": "Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review key aspects of Cigna's first quarter 2022 results, and I'll discuss our updated outlook for the full year. As David noted, we are very pleased with our strong start to the year, as first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations. This performance combined with our continued momentum give us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% off of our reported 2021 EPS. Looking at the first quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights, include adjusted revenue growth of 8% to $44.1 million, after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.9 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.01. Regarding our segments, I'll first comment on Evernorth. First quarter 2022 adjusted revenues grew 10% to $33.6 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, both in line with our expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and a continued focus on delivering lowest net cost solutions for our clients and customers. We also continue to make meaningful strategic investments for the expansion of client relationships, as well as a new solution development and digital capabilities. These investments ensure the continued differentiation of our scaled Evernorth businesses and support the expansion of our Evernorth Care capabilities. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well, with attractive top and bottom line growth, in line with our expectations. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, which, as a reminder, now includes our US commercial, US government and retained international health businesses. We ended the year prioritizing margin expansion, having taken targeted pricing and affordability actions during 2021 for impact in 2022. We also expected to drive customer growth in each of our US commercial market segments and we're pleased with how we started the year. For Cigna Healthcare overall, first quarter 2022 adjusted revenues were $11.4 billion, pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.5%. The medical care ratio was better than our expectations in the quarter, primarily due to lower COVID testing and treatment costs. In January, COVID incidence was at its highest level throughout the pandemic, but case counts dropped significantly in February and March. Importantly, even during the January Omicron peak, we observed substantially lower severity than earlier in the pandemic and subsequently lower treatment costs. In total, Cigna Healthcare's earnings exceeded our expectations, driven by the favorable medical care ratio, strong specialty contributions and net investment income on our alternative asset portfolio. Net medical customer growth in Cigna Healthcare was also strong, as clients and customers continue to recognize the differentiated value we bring as a partner through our consultative approach and our innovative solutions. We ended the quarter with 17.8 million total medical customers, growth of 4%, or approximately 700,000 customers sequentially. This growth was driven almost entirely by an increase in fee-based customers. Notably, we grew across all of our US commercial market segments and in International health. US government enrollment decreased, as expected, inclusive of the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2022. For Corporate and Other Operations, the first quarter 2022 pretax adjusted loss was $117 million. Across the enterprise, we delivered strong first quarter financial results with contributions across our diversified portfolio. Now with respect to our outlook for full year 2022, our strong start gives us the confidence to increase our full year earnings per share outlook, as I will detail in a moment. At Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance with both top and bottom line growth in line with long-term targets, all while continuing to invest in growth and innovation. In Cigna Healthcare, we expect to continue to grow customers, while expanding margins over 2021. We are raising our medical customer outlook to growth of at least 725,000 customers and reaffirming our 2022 medical care ratio outlook of 82% to 83.5%. For Cigna Healthcare in total, we now expect full year 2022 adjusted earnings of approximately $3.95 billion. Taken as a whole, we are raising our EPS guidance and now expect consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $22.60 per share, representing growth of at least 10% over our reported 2021 earnings per share. Now moving to our 2022 capital management position and outlook. We expect our businesses to continue to generate strong cash flows and attractive return capital. In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12% to $1.12 per share. And year-to-date as of May 5, 2022, we have repurchased 7.6 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion. For full year 2022, we continue to expect at least $8.25 billion of cash flow from operations and to deploy at least $7 billion to share repurchases. We now expect full year weighted average shares of 310 million to 314 million shares, an increase of two million shares at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to our updated expectation for the timing of closing the international divestiture. We now expect this to occur later in the second quarter impacting the timing of our anticipated share repurchase. As a reminder, the financial performance of this business is included within Corporate and Other operations until the divestiture is complete. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based orientation that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. Results in the first quarter were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio. Evernorth continues to deliver strong top and bottom line growth in line with our expectations, while Cigna Healthcare has had a strong start to the year giving us the confidence to deliver on our increased 2022 EPS guidance of at least $22.60. I look forward to continuing to discuss our performance, our strategy and our long-term financial outlook with all of you at our upcoming Investor Day on June 3. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning, Nathan. So in terms of the expense growth in the quarter for Evernorth vis-a\u0300-vis the revenue growth, and how thinking about the full year there. As you noted, the SG&A was up 13% quarter-over-quarter Evernorth, while the revenue was up 10%. You can think of the expense growth is predominantly fueling future growth within Evernorth. So I mentioned earlier, we're making strategic investments to build out our Evernorth Care platform. When you think about Care management, Care coordination Care delivery, alternate sites of Care. We talked to you about virtual care in the past behavioral health in home care. We're making a series of investments there. That won't just be limited to the first quarter. There will be a multi-year investments to continue to diversify our health services portfolio within Evernorth. But for the full year, importantly, our income for Evernorth will be up 5% from where it was in 2021, and our revenue will be up in that same general zone. So you should not think of margin erosion transpiring for the full year even though expenses grew a bit faster than revenue within the first quarter. Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, I'll try to tackle both of those questions here. In terms of the medical cost performance in the first quarter, as I noted earlier, we saw some favorability come through in the form of COVID costs in particular compared to our expectations in the first quarter. So both testing and treatment came in a bit favorable to what we had been forecasting for the first quarter of the year. And that was true across the commercial book of business in the most pronounced fashion, but in totality for Cigna Healthcare. As it relates to non-COVID, the non-COVID costs came in essentially right where we were expecting them to, meaning, if you look at it on a cost trend basis, the cost trends compared to the first quarter of 2021 we're very much in line with our expectations in terms of seeing a normal kind of low-to-mid-single-digit type cost trend on the non-COVID services. We're not really seeing any signs of acuity spikes or pent-up demand, emerge things like blood screenings, preventive exams, mammograms, colonoscopies are all in line with where they were in 2019, on a per capita basis. And for that matter really were in 2021 as well. So non-COVID shaping up very much in line with what we had been expecting coming into the year. As it relates to the full year outlook for the medical care ratio, you're right we reaffirmed the 82% to the 83.5% range, despite the first quarter coming in a bit favorable. We felt like just being one quarter into the year. This was a prudent thing for us to do and a prudent posture to take given there's three more quarters and respecting that COVID had a lot of twists and turns over the past couple of years. But it would be reasonable to assume the midpoint of our range maybe shading slightly towards the lower half of the range, as you were thinking about where the full year is likely to shake out based on what we've seen so far. Good morning, Gary. Back on the first part of your question in terms of the first quarter 2022 Scripts volumes and such. I think your macro conclusion is right in terms of the Scripts being down 2% is largely a function of the client wins and losses and the net effect of that. The vaccines were pretty flat year-over-year. If you look at the first quarter of 2022 versus first quarter 2021, within 1 million or so Scripts, so that's really not a material driver quarter-over-quarter. Importantly, though, as David, into that, here, as each day passes, the total script count metric becomes less and less important to measuring Evernorth's overall performance. And what do I mean by that is, we have more and more volume coming through our specialty pharmacy, as we have more and more volume coming through our Care platform, you're going to see more earnings and more revenue associated with things that are not directly linked to Scripts. So, as an example, within Specialty, Specialty just crossed over the 35% mark in terms of contribution to overall Evernorth revenue, but it represents less than 1% of our overall prescription volume. So, over 35% of the revenue, less than 1% of the prescriptions. So again, just that metric, I would encourage you to gradually move away from when you're looking at the health of the Evernorth business in totality. Justin it's Brian. So in terms of interest rates, the macro conclusion you should draw as you think about Cigna is directionally positive when interest rates move up, but also not terribly material in the grand scheme of things in terms of the direct quantifiable impact. The majority of our balance sheet whether you look at the asset side or the liability side and fixed rate longer-term instruments and those that are shorter term in nature or carry a variable rate. We tend to have on a net basis slightly more exposure on the asset side than the liability side, which creates some favorability in terms of the investment income spread and such. So -- but to mentioning it you shouldn't think of this as terribly material. It's in the call it $20 million to $30 million range annually if you were to look at a 100 basis point move in, in rates order of magnitude. As it relates to the earnings seasonality and I'll talk in EPS terms. Given the strength of the first quarter, you should think of the overall first half of the year is generating about half or roughly half of the full year earnings per share emergence. And then in the back half of the year, we tend to see the fourth quarter as a lower point relative to the third quarter just given the seasonality in the Cigna Healthcare book of business where deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums tend to be met more frequently. So you should think of third quarter being a little bit stronger than the fourth quarter. Good morning, Kevin it's Brian. So obviously, we're really pleased with having such a strong start to the year. One thing I would note is, I saw some of the early headlines here in the morning. Our own expectations were a bit higher than consensus for the first quarter. So we had a slightly different quarterly pattern as you think about the magnitude of the first quarter beat. Now we were ahead of our own expectations as I mentioned earlier as well, but just not to the same tune as where I think -- the Street had come in for the first quarter expectations. But as you think about the balance of the year there's really nothing specific I would call out in terms of things that will reverse later or looming issues that might emerge in the second half of the year as you alluded to. We just feel this is a prudent posture to take being just one quarter into the year to raise by $0.20. And keep in mind that's an at least $22.60 EPS expectation for the year. As always, we'll also evaluate additional strategic investments as the year unfolds and digital capabilities and other technology that we're looking to bring to market. But again, there's nothing in particular I'd flag as you think about the balance of the year. Yes. As I said earlier, we think this is just a prudent move at this point in the year we release in particular with Cigna Healthcare being above our expectations. Good morning, George, it's Brian. I'll start on the first point, and then David will pick up on the second. As you about our specialty pharmacy business, again, we continue to be really pleased with the performance over a multiyear period here, we've had really attractive top and bottom line growth and with biosimilars coming, it will provide some further fuel as we look forward. Directionally, you should think of the margin profile on the specialty pharmacy as we not tremendously different than the overall segment just, if you were to sum up to date. But importantly, there's some scrambled eggs, if you will when you think about many of our client relationships are not specific to just specialty or just PBM or just mail order. So we tend to get overall client profitability and not just necessarily one silo within ever north. But you shouldn't think of it as being terribly different than the overall segment margin profile. David, do you want to pick up on the second piece of George's question? Good morning, Ricky. So in terms of biosimilars and how we think about Humira relative to the long-term 4% to 6% expectation, we're at a bit of an inflection point right now, because we're getting ready for some acceleration in the biosimilar market as you know over the next two to three years. And David talked about this in response to an earlier question. But even Humira alone and Stelara, those two drugs by themselves represent about 20% of total specialty spend. So the next two to three years will be very telling in terms of how much interchangeability comes to market, how much we're able to move customers over, et cetera. And we're very excited about the prospect to generate affordability for benefit of our clients and customers, and ultimately capture a piece of that value in terms of our economic model. It will be just four weeks from today. Actually we have our Investor Day. And in that time period Eric Palmer is going to spend a little more time talking about biosimilars and how that links into our financial picture. So I don't want to necessarily front-run that conversation, but we'll give you more detail at that time in terms of how to think about that contextually in the sense of our longer-term Evernorth growth expectations."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. We're off to a very good start to the year, with the first quarter defined by strong results across both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, positive momentum and focused execution, all of which are advancing our strategy and driving growth. We're pleased with our performance overall, specifically, with delivering adjusted EPS above our initial expectations. Today, I'm going to keep my comments relatively brief and focus on some of the key drivers of our performance. Brian will then provide additional details about our financial results and our outlook for 2022 and we'll take your questions. Then on June 3, we'll host our Investor Day, we will provide a deeper level of insights relative to our strategic vision, the growth profile of our businesses and differentiated drivers that will deliver sustained attractive growth. So let's jump in. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue of $44 billion and $6.01 of adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our strong results this quarter we are now raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance, underscoring our view that we will achieve another strong year of performance for our company in 2022. We also remain on track to generate $12 billion in deployable capital for the year and directing at least $7 billion to repurchase our shares I want to take a minute to thank our team for all their hard work that led disease outstanding results. Our more than 70000 colleagues in the world are committed to delivering our promise in the market day in day out. And as a result expanding our client customer relationships, all of which enables us to grow and deliver strong results for our shareholders. Now let's take a deeper look at Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms and the drivers of their performance. Following an outstanding year of growth in 2021, Evernorth maintained momentum with strong top and bottom line results in the quarter, driven in part by the sustained growth of our Accredo and Scripts specialty pharmacy business which continues to represent one of the fastest-growing parts of our health service portfolio  The key driver of this performance is the way in which Evernorth is increasingly resonating with a wide range of buyers including employers, health plans, governmental organizations and health care delivery systems. In an environment, we're getting people the right care and treatment at an affordable price is of paramount importance. I spent meaningful time over the past few months meeting with a number of our clients and partners and they consistently point to the attractive breadth and depth of Evernorth's services and expertise. Our clients rely upon these services and expertise to solve the most pressing health care needs. For some clients, this means tapping into the strength of our pharmacy services. Others that meet me are behavioral health support. With others, the unique specialty pharmacy expertise of the table. More and more our clients are seeking our solutions that leverage our broad high-performing portfolio of capabilities. For example, Evernorth recently launched a new provider consult service for patients with cancer. This service leverages our powerful analytics to identify and connect patients to their oncologists to cancer subspecialty experts and designated National Cancer Institute Centers. And this process enables patients to get access to the latest innovations in research with better health outcomes, lower costs and importantly, keeps the patient's care close to home and their family. This service augments our existing suite of oncology solutions including personalized case management, mental health care, financial support services, pharmacy solutions and collaborative partnerships with oncology providers. Additionally, on the strength of our offerings a couple of weeks ago, we announced a new long-term strategic collaboration between Evernorth and Kaiser Permanente. We're drawing utilities across both Evernorth and our Cigna Healthcare platforms in a way that creates new opportunities for serving a broad range of Kaiser's clients and customers. This builds on our successful relationships for example with Prime Therapeutics and the Department of Defense, both of which were recently renewed for extended track periods. Finally, it's still early in the 2022 selling season but we are continuing to see strong demand for our Evernorth services amongst existing and new clients and additional opportunities to deliver even more value, particularly as we expect more biosimilars to come to market over the coming years and we are seeing strong retention in our Evernorth portfolio of businesses. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered a strong start to the year. Our medical care ratio during the quarter was 81.5%, which was better than we had projected. This reflects the disciplined and targeted actions we initiated last year to improve our results including implementing new affordability efforts and pricing actions. In US Commercial, we achieved strong membership growth during the quarter with growth across each of our segments. At a time when employers are trying to navigate a complex economic landscape for their businesses and an emotionally taxing environment for their employees, many are turning to us is the right strategic growth partner to improve presenteeism, productivity and health outcomes. Employers tell us that they value the ability of our US commercial teams to partner with them in developing programs that guide employees to the right care at the right place at the right time, programs supporting them and attracting and retaining talent, through strong employer sponsor benefits programs and services, and programs providing greater predictability in managing financial risk for the companies while optimizing their cash flow during these uncertain times. Our International business also contributed to our growth during the quarter as it achieved higher customer retention and membership growth levels. We also remain on track with the divestiture of our International life, accident and supplemental benefits business in certain countries to jump. With our sharpened focus on health services, we continue to see attractive opportunities for serving multinational employers, governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and the globally mobile population. In our US government business, enrollment was down as expected as we prioritize margin expansion and completed the divestiture of our Texas Medicaid business. We continue to take actions to position our government business for growth in 2023 and over the long-term. Now to wrap up. Our first quarter results are strong. They underscore the momentum we're building as we serve the evolving needs of our customers and clients as well as continue to drive growth and margin improvement in our company. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.01 and we continue to make strategic investments in our business while paying a meaningful dividend and remaining on path to repurchase at least $7 billion of our shares in 2022. With focused execution we are demonstrating our ability to navigate and lead through this continued dynamic environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Matthew, good morning, it's David. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased with the start of the year and our full year outlook relative to our commercial portfolio. And the commercial portfolio performed very well across each of the segments National Accounts, Middle Market and our Select segment. And as Brian noted our growth is essentially all ASO self-funded services with our appropriate specialty services are attached to it. I'd highlight a few things. One, strong retention across the block of business. So, we're sought to move forward with some pricing in some of the segments. Two, we've further deepened relationships and we had some wonderful new business adds across the portfolio and notably within the Middle Market. So, headline there is some very good strength across the board from both retention as well as new business adds. And as you noted essentially all self-funded which as you know we really appreciate the self-funded opportunities because we have good alignment, good transparency, and ongoing collaboration with our clients around the program development and the we're able to deliver. Sure Stephen, good morning. It's David. So, a couple of dimensions to your question. First broadly speaking the retention rate -- and I would note that we were quite pleased with the retention rate across the portfolio but specifically in the Select segment where we pushed for a little bit further rate execution on the guaranteed cost or risk side of the portfolio even without our retention rate was a bit stronger than we anticipated showing that our product and our portfolio continues to resonate. Secondly, an ice mix of obviously, retention to achieve the growth we have. We have to have new business growth. That's both in existing relationships expanding to new geographies or subsets of portfolios and new business adds. I highlight as we talked in the prior quarter a very nice large win which shows up in our Middle Market portfolio because it's a locally dense relationship that was achieved through an excellent collaboration between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare where we had a large long-standing high-performing Evernorth relationship that we're able to introduce the Cigna Healthcare portfolio to and grow from that standpoint. So, retention a bit stronger I would call out the select segment great work that that team is doing retention is strong across the board and new business adds in each of the segments both in existing relationships and new relationships that we added. Good morning. It's David. Let me take the first part of your question, and I'll ask Brian to take the second part of your question. As you called out, the specialty performance within Evernorth continues to be quite strong. We're really pleased with the performance of our overall portfolio, and specifically specialty as you know. I'd remind you that, our specialty portfolio, serves multiple segments. Specifically, Accredo Think about that as serving individual direct patient needs on a highly focused basis, including in-home care coordination where appropriate, and Scripts supporting medical professionals by delivering the right drug at the right time for purposes of their services and their needs. I'd also note that, as you would expect, our team is quite excited about and well positioned for the accelerating biosimilar trend that we see in front of us for the coming years. And we're success in the biosimilar space will require not only strong performing specialty capabilities in terms of the breadth of the specialty capabilities, but high coordination on the medical side of the equation, because those decisions as you know are typically made one patient at a time in terms of coordinating the transition of care, where appropriate, unless there's a perfect match from that standpoint. So strength in both the consumer part of our specialty portfolio, as well as the healthcare professional part of our specialty portfolio, and well positioned for evolving biosimilar acceleration as we go forward leveraging our specialty capabilities as well as our medical capabilities. I would not call out any unique drug class changes as a driver of growth, but let me transition to Bryan to expand on that and the second part of your question. Josh, good morning, it's David. First, relative to the space and really appreciate you re-amplifying the oncology opportunity. As we know, the volume of oncology needs in the United States other markets as well but in the United States continues to grow. And we're really pleased with the innovation that is taking place. So we're taking an analytical approach to identify individual patients. So the target market are individual patients that we serve today. So think about that through either Cigna Healthcare and our diversity in healthcare relationships. And increasingly going forward, a service that we'll be able to be offered to our Evernorth health playing clients as an example as a consult to bring that level of precision, identify individual patients who in coordination with their specific oncologists so analytical matching of the patient their oncologist where we determine that by matching them to a center of excellence and bringing the consult precisely back to the patient with their oncologists we could advance quality, affordability and the overall care equation without in many cases needing to have the patient transport themselves to the center of excellence. So it's an example of bringing the Precision two by using the data and the care coordination and our partnerships. So the target audience is individual patients largely through our Cigna Healthcare portfolio, through the rollout that's taking place right now but increasingly as in Evernorth service be able to be offered to our health plan clients and others. And then secondly, if I heard your \u2013 the latter part of your question correctly, think about these types of approaches as indicative and we talk about what Brian made reference to in terms of Evernorth Care, opportunities to again curate and coordinate more of the Care equation, using data and then the breadth of care to bring more services forward. And we'll seek to provide some additional insights relative to at our Investor Day some additional programs that we'll be rolling out in this year not oncologic waste but taking a similar harnessing of data and real-time service delivery. Really appreciate your question. Scott, good morning. You're right we will cover that in June, but let me just profile the broader direction. First and foremost, we continue to see our government segment and specifically within that Medicare Advantage as a very attractive sustained growth opportunity. In 2022, we're in year three of our expansion and growth initiative. And while clearly 2022 was well short of our specific growth algorithm for a variety of reasons including market conditions. Our three-year average growth was just a bit below our low end of our strategic range. Now specific to 2023, we are building our plans and initiatives, specifically to drive attractive growth in 2023. We'll profile a little further. We'll leverage our strong stars positioning, our NPS positioning and our overall medical cost in our targeted MSAs. And I would remind you that we're largely an individual HMO and individual PPO oriented organization. Two, we will demonstrate at Investor Day but we'll \u2013 our plans are building on harnessing now some of the investment we've made in terms of our market expansions over the last couple of years, whereby the early yield traction on market expansion is low in year one. But by the time you get out to year three, we have higher expectations, targeted investments in marketing and distribution. And then importantly, we expect in 2023 to begin to realize more yield off of our commercial agent population and PDP and med sup conversion opportunities that's in front of us. So specifically, our expectations will be and we're building our plans around an attractive growth year for 2023. Good morning, A.J., it's David. In some ways it's early -- in other ways, the trend is upon us right? We're seeing the convergence which is a net positive. We think it's a net positive from a -- standpoint relative to the opportunity to further improve affordability. And given our Evernorth model, we have the services with Evernorth and some leverage relative to Cigna Healthcare to really harness this opportunity on a go-forward basis. We don't think there's a single influent point that exists. Maybe that's inferred in your comment. So it's not as though 2023 or 2025 is the single year, we see a ramping of activity. And our teams as you would expect are working class-by-class, drug-by-drug with manufacturers as well as with the programs that we will have in place. And the choices we will be able to offer our clients. I think, very importantly, the consultative nature of the way Evernorth supports our clients will be even more pronounced and more beneficial with the biosimilar trends, as it evolves. As you would expect, given the energy we have relative to our specialty portfolio and its respective traction, this will be an area we'll seek to amplify a bit more specifically at our Investor Day. But suffice to say, there's not a singular inflection point, 2023 is an important year, with some convergence, but 2024, 2025 begin to ramp and beyond. So we're well positioned relative to that, to improve affordability for our clients and customers and have Evernorth benefit from the value it's creating for our clients, customers and patients. Good morning, Gary. It's David. Let me start and then ask Brian to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth framework and why Scripts are, I think, an important example, but given the breadth of Evernorth, no longer the sole example that you should be looking at. Specific to your framing, relative to the current year, broadly speaking, I think, your walk-in faming is right. There was -- we had a little lower retention rate than our historic average and clearly, lower than our phenomenal 2019 and 2020 retention level from that standpoint. Your question, I think, goes to 2023 and as I noted we're positioned to have another strong growth year for 2023 for Evernorth, both on a new business and on a renewal basis. Now specific to PBM, before I transition over to Brian, to talk a little bit more relative to the Evernorth growth, we're right at about a 90% visibility. So about 90% of the books already renewed, which is good at this point, in time of the year and we feel quite strong relative to that. And as we sit here right now, specific to the PBM portion of Evernorth, which is what you're asking about, we expect our retention to be higher than 2022's retention level and revert back to more of the historic norm of 95% or a bit better from that standpoint. But importantly 90% of the book is renewed and we still have some active selling that sits in front of us right now, because the marketplace continues to be pretty fluid in the current environment. Brian? Good morning, Lisa. Good to chat with you this morning. So, there's a couple of different I think flavors to your question. Let me try to be succinct as I can with them. First, the whole person health or the coordination of care and services remains mission-critical and as we've learned as a society has been amplified in this COVID environment. So first, by way of background, we continue to expand access to behavioral services, whether it's expanding a network in a traditional sense, whether it's expanding behavioral services through virtual care, whether it's being the first have virtual care capabilities, be covered as in-network services through the likes of Ginger. But then, the next step is how do you coordinate point solutions like that and bring them together. And so, let's walk that across MDLIVE. MDLIVE is a great example, and we couldn't be more pleased by having that asset as part of the company to be able to innovate off of, because MDLIVE underscores as a symbol our view and commitment that harnessing technology and data to bring more services on a real time highly personalized basis to a patient or individual, presents one of the biggest opportunities in front of our society for the coming years. And specifically, as you take virtual care and you coordinate medical, behavioral, pharmacy services, et cetera and coordinate those services, patients benefit at a significant level. As we click it down another notch, we've seen some disruption in the marketplace, but I would remind you that our model is not a B2C model dependent upon B2C activation only building off of a triage of it. Or is more B2B and then cultivating the relationship with the customer, whether it's through an employer, a health plan or a health care professional organization and then, end with a fact to underscore our MDLIVE volumes year-over-year Q1 2021 versus Q1 2022, we're up about 29%. So an area where we have significant conviction being able to again coordinate point solutions as opposed to just push point solutions and having it, be highly patient-centric in real time represents a tremendous opportunity and we're pleased with our progress thus far. Yes. So Lisa, I'm sorry, I didn't touch upon that. And you're right we will touch upon that at Investor Day. So, I'll just try to what your appetite by saying, absolutely, we see tremendous opportunity. So, when you think about it, the leverage between Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare's portfolio, we already have significant proof points and traction relative to that, and there's more opportunity that Eric and our colleagues will walk through when we're at Investor Day. But importantly those services are not limited to Cigna Healthcare, everything we're building within Evernorth is built with an eye toward, yes Cigna Healthcare as a client to improve quality and affordability and we'll walk through proof points relative to that. But simultaneously to be able to bring it to market to stand-alone employer relationships that minor serves, our health plan clients integrated delivery systems et cetera on a go-forward basis. So we see that addressable market underscoring your point to be quite broad, quite large in terms of what we're building and the ability to improve affordability, personalization and clinical quality, whether it's for Cigna Healthcare or other relationships present a tremendous opportunity and we will amplify that Investor Day. Justin you're live, but you have different names. So you have an alias this morning. It's good to hear your voice. Good morning Kevin, it's David. Before we get into the Kaiser opportunity, which I will. I remind you that, we talk about a strategic imperative in the company that we referred to. Our objective as we seek to be the undisputed part of choice. Why do we say that? Because we're guided by a tenant that suggests that if we could identify alignment with potential partners, which I'll come back to Kaiser, we could have the opportunity together to create more value. More reach, more service, more affordability, more clinical quality. So specific to Kaiser that fits into the category and we could not be more excited and pleased with the opportunity to partner up with Kaiser It represents a multiyear strategic relationship where we together can improve access value and affordability.  And as I noted in my prepared remarks, it builds on a successful track record with organizations like Prime Therapeutics where we'll look at a totally different organization with the Department of where we successfully renewed both Prime Therapeutics in the Department of Defense and expanded relationships are recently UPMC et cetera. So it's an orientation, relative to collaborating in a different way and leveraging not only Evernorth's capabilities but in many cases the Cigna Healthcare capabilities. So as it relates to the core of your question in 2022, I would not view it as a major top line or bottom driver given the size and breather Corporation. But as we've proven with other relationships we see it as an opportunity that will have significant and attractive growth over the coming years as we collaborate together and co-innovate together for both top line and bottom line which will be reinforcing of growing in relationships. So I'd ask you to put in the category of a an orientation and a long track record of successful partnerships and we could not be more pleased to partner up with Kaiser and build some shared capabilities and innovation to serve clients and customers with better affordability and reach make clinical quality.\nQ \u2013 Kevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks so much Sure, George. No doubt, the environment has remained active. As you noted from a state, as well as federal standpoint, we do not see any one item, I think underlying your question do we see any one item or one theme as a de-railer relative to our business strategy or capabilities? No. And more macro, we are aligned around initiatives that seek to further improve affordability. All aspects of what we do day in day out within our pharmacy services portfolio, are to drive the right level of differentiated affordability, of course, with clinical and service quality always matched up against that, and we're quite proud of what we've been able to do. And I would note, just as an example, it seems like just yesterday, but it's actually three years ago, we launched our patient assurance program for insulin customers. And today, we have 10 million customers in the patient assurance program just three years later. And the patient assurance program was uniquely designed at that time, and still differentiated in the marketplace. The caps a 30-day outlay for an individual customer at $25. So more broadly to your question, it is active. We do not see any one item as a rally relative to our strategy rather the breadth of our services, capabilities, funding, mechanisms and our approach relative to integrating services we see as creating more opportunities than not as we seek to innovate and redefine the way we're able to bring those services to market. Ricky, good morning, it's David. I'll take your first question. I'll ask Brian to take your second question. Specifically, the first question comes back toward care delivery and I think underscoring that is primary care delivery in the marketplace. Our orientation today relative to care delivery more broadly is we seek to own and differentiate in target areas within care delivery. Those areas include virtual care, specialty pharmacy care and services aspects of behavior health care and services, aspects of home health care services. We see these as sustainable differentiated services that can be leveraged and coordinated. And in many cases function on a nationalized basis or a more seamless basis across multiple geographies. As it relates to physical primary care outside of say, virtual care, which would have primary in it, but physical primary care our stated strategy remains, we seek to partner with and enable health care professionals with aligned incentive models in our care coordination services and that continued to perform -- that strategy has continued to perform very well for us both in a capital-light service orientation, but in the shared collaboration as underscored by our sustained differentiated medical cost trend in clinical quality and NPS we've been able to deliver. Lastly, I would say, Ricky that as we've noted in the past, we are willing to own as we do in a select MSA in the Southwest. We are willing to own primary care physical assets. If we conclude that the only way to get the right balance of affordability access and quality is through ownership, but our preferred approach is again to partner and enable and that has served us well for quite some time, while we seek to differentiate ourself in virtual specialty pharmacy behavioral and home care. Brian, I'll ask you to pick up on Humira. Dave, good morning, it's David. I'll take both your questions. First, I would not call out the slice phenomenon, whether it's slicing or consolidate as a major driver specifically, as it relates to 2022. The phenomenon transpires as clients look for additional value, and as they seek additional value. I'd underscore though a little bit of a subset here that may be inferred in your question. As we've all learned throughout the prolonged pandemic where people live and work continues to be more fluid than ever. Hence having the seamless network access care coordination and service capabilities that are truly national, and again, seamless remains a differentiator. And like a few -- I'm not going to say, Cigna is no one like a few that proposition I think is even more important today than ever before in terms of supporting the marketplace. But I would not call it the slice phenomenon is unique. As it relates to the Medicaid redeterminations first in our 2022 outlook or our multiyear strategy stand today we do not have a big uptake that would be planned for relative to redeterminations. We do think we'll be a net beneficiary. There'll be some that plays through. And whether it shows up in our IFP or exchange business or in our commercial portfolio through the mechanisms in which people access care or services we do believe that we'll see some opportunity in it but we do not have that factored into our outlook. And we do not believe that you have to be a Medicaid player to benefit from that. We've seen seamlessness of individuals moving over a prolonged period of time even pre-pandemic between programs. So that phenomenon as it relates to the redetermination and the way in which people seamlessly move between either Medicaid and exchange or whether they move between Medicaid through a redetermination now to a broader commercial population we do not see Medicaid as a gate. So that presents some potential upside for us going forward. Again thank you for joining our call today. Just to reinforce a few points, we achieved strong results in the first quarter and we're stepping into the rest of 2022 with momentum. We're confident that we will deliver our increased EPS outlook of at least $22.60 for 2022. Our performance is a direct result of the hard work, dedication and passion of our more than 70,000 coworkers across our company who work every day to change people's life for the better. Our actions are also guided by our drive to make healthcare more affordable predictable and simple for our clients and our customers as well as our patients. We look forward to talk to you more next month at our Investor Day about our vision for the future and the progress we're making in driving a meaningful impact for those we serve as well as our long-term sustained growth outlook. Hope you have a great rest of your day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics including our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Pertaining to our financial results, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a net after-tax special item charge of $552 million or $1.88 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners in the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth. Now today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth. Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions. Now before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals.  And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses well large at about $12 billion in revenue would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio. Additionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare. Now as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion, and disciplined pricing activity. Now with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Probably for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results, in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the five years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year. And we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments. In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and growth. Now I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication, so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling, well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that were ready to serve in 2024 and I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and of the clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023, is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice as well as independent Rx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we have further an expanding choice for clients funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts clear network. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results. With Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically compliant specialty drugs. We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it, while also remaining connected with physical sense of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting the growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities were valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers. In Cigna Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system. Our leading clinical care programs could use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulting in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. In international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high-quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Now turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses. Pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group. We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Second, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments. And within Care Services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care, as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $20.25, we expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcement we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past three years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group, while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions, as well as other leadership changes we announced provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy, as well as the extent of reach and impact lucid to have. Importantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Cigna Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth. Now I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we are raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We are building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We have sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we are positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We are building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $28.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024. We'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target, while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth. As our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers. Fourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023. And our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023, reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo specialty pharmacy. Now turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our stop-loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025, following regulatory approvals. And our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance, and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare, primarily from U.S. commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disrupted market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings. The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7%, with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the Enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of Enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1% and an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now, framing our 2024 capital outlook, we expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures. And we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to, repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $282 million to 286 million shares. Now to recap, our full year 2023, consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator, for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from A.J. Rice with UBS. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody and thanks for the question. Obviously, we have the announcement on your sale of the Medicare Advantage business. And yet you're saying you still view the business as attractive. Obviously, there's been some volatility in some of the performance of some of the other players in this space already announced. Is this the time in your mind to sort of step back from the market and give some time for the dust to settle? Or how should we interpret the comments that you still think that segment is attractive? And then also on that, obviously, is there a speculation at least in the press about deal discussions. Your stock was quite volatile. I wonder if you could give us a little bit on how you approach large transactions, some of the financial parameters that people should keep in mind that would be hopefully reassuring for them.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you. Good morning. It's David. You have a lot in that question. And I appreciate it. Let me try to address some of the high points. First and foremost, we are really pleased with the nature of the transaction we're able to structure with HCSC. We see it as a win-win. And it's a clarification to our strategy within our portfolio. As I noted in my prepared remarks while we view the market as an attractive growth market. The required capital investment resources focus relative to its size within our portfolio, coupled with the continued elevated regulatory environment, our decision was it was best to enter this transaction. Point two is, very importantly, we've been quite deliberate now for several years, working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, et cetera.  And we're demonstrating a very attractive proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise, and we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us. As it relates to your latter part of your question, I'll reframe our M&A criteria. I want to make sure I put that in the context of our capital deployment criteria. We continue to view, first, capital deployment priorities, investing in our business. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment of about $1.5 billion. Second, we always evaluate M&A for its appropriate attributes, which I'll come back to in a moment. And then third, returning capital to shareholders. And as Brian noted, in 2024, in addition to raising our dividend by 14%, we expect to return the majority of our excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase with at least $5 billion in the first half of the year. Lastly, in your action pack question, as we think about the criteria for transactions, we think about three criteria: first, strategic attraction; second, financial attraction; and then third, overall path to clarity. So is it strategically aligned? Is it financially attractive? And as a final note, when we think about the financial piece of the equation, you evaluate each deal on its own respective merits. But seeking to get high visibility in terms of your value creation for your organization if you're going to enter into a transaction. So to repeat, we're pleased with the decision and the transaction design. We will continue in a long-term service relationship with HCSC that further expands our proven track record within Evernorth. We see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive capital-light high visibility way to grow this portfolio. And as we have in the past, we will maintain very strong discipline for capital deployment and our 2024 capital deployment priorities are quite clear. Thanks.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask another kind of quick follow-up on the Medicare Advantage. So I would be curious if you'd be willing to share maybe your five- or 10-year view of the market. So I totally appreciate that it's a small part of your business before the sale. But you are still the eighth largest plan in the country. Do you think market share and concentration is ultimately going to look much more like the commercial market than it does today? Would love any kind of medium-term thoughts you could offer in the market. Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Steve, good morning, it's David. You're asking for a 10-year crystal ball. I think in the dynamism of the marketplace, most people come back to in terms of rolling three-year views of a given market. But stepping back, first and foremost, the Medicare Advantage offering, broadly speaking, in the marketplace is a very attractive offering for seniors. And it has a long-term proven track record of delivering attractive benefits. And importantly, clinical coordination when you get to the Medicare beneficiaries, typically dealing with a higher level of clinical burden that's necessary for coordination. And the care outcomes, the quality outcomes, the overall value outcomes are positive. So broadly speaking, from a societal standpoint, we see MA as an important asset for the U.S. to continue to be served, supported financially and grow. Secondly, the marketplace will see ebbs and flows in terms of the funding mechanism. We see the early look at the rate letter at the moment in time. That's a moment in time, either acceleration or potentially deceleration for that marketplace. Third is, if you look at the senior satisfaction level, NPS broadly - Net Promoter Score broadly is attractive for Medicare Advantage. Therefore, as I noted previously to A.J.'s point, we worked really aggressively to ensure that we have a broad and we will continue to broaden the portfolio of services in support of health plans and integrated value-based care providers to be in support of value-based care, be it for Medicare Advantage tools or the commercial population. So we see the marketplace as a growth market. Its respective growth will ebb and flow depending on reimbursement to some level from the government, lending toward benefit richness. And then ultimately, as you know, the last comment I would make is the primary wave of the baby boomer aging has reached a peak and is slowing. It's still attractive, but that primary wave has reached its peak and is slowing somewhat. Take it as a whole, we see this as an expansion opportunity for Evernorth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, and good morning. I want to focus on Evernorth and maybe just understand some of the key drivers as we think about 2024. So first off, you talked about specialty in 2023. Can you talk about what your expectations are about growth in specialty in 2024? What you're doing around services? You touched a little bit on GLP-1. But you had a really big contract with CNC coming on board, but you also had an overall good 2024 selling season. So any of the key elements you can help us to understand as to what the drivers are for that strong AOI growth in Evernorth?\nEric Palmer: Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. It's Eric. A couple of different pieces in there. But first, let me just talk a bit about the portfolio of services that we're focused on in terms of Evernorth and transition that into some of the drivers of growth specifically for 2024. David noted in his prepared remarks, a couple of highlights on capabilities we're growing. But I would call out, we are seeing significant interest from the market around teams helping to better coordinate individual point solutions and alleviate some of the burden that comes along with the fragmentation of how care is administered and how employers and plans are assembling care. So us working to improve navigation and reduce point solution fatigue is a key item. Second of all, I would note, behavioral care continues to be an area of focus, and there's meaningful opportunity for behavioral care to be better coordinated as there's significant comorbidities with individuals with mental health care needs, along with other care needs, and we're in a position to help us address those challenges. The third item I'd note would be around specialty and in particular, the opportunity for us to continue to grow as there are more therapies, more choices in the specialty market as well as navigating through biosimilars. Overall, we're positioned really well to continue to drive affordability and choice in biosimilars. And as we've talked about previously, that's an important long-term multi-year tailwind in the economics and the growth of Evernorth overall. And then certainly, the continued growth in therapies like GLP-1s are is an area that's a factor in our proposition overall. So you put together that kind of touched on a number of the different capabilities. When you put together that suite of capabilities, that ends up being a really attractive portfolio that we've had continued growth in the number of lives we're serving, growth in our clients' lives that enable us to deliver the numbers that we're talking about. Overall, really excited about the momentum we've got going into 2024 and see ourselves as well positioned to deliver there and continue the trajectory beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning guys. I guess just a couple of clarifying questions for me as it relates to MLR and the guide for '2024. You guys have kind of bumped up the medical cost expectations. Can you kind of disaggregate what you're seeing by line of business there? And I just want to confirm that the MA business is still kind of included in the continuing ops in the MLR guidance for 2024, because I saw in the footnotes it's kind of being carried as an asset held for sale. So, it just kind of like a, disaggregation of kind of medical cost expectations and trends expectations for 2024.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning George, its Brian. So let me just take the MA question first and then I'll get into the MCR. So as noted in my comments earlier, the Medicare Advantage business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare through 2024. So all of our guidance whether that be the revenue guidance, the customer volume guidance, the earnings guidance, all assumes that the Medicare business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare on an asset held-for-sale basis so, just to clarify that. So, all the metrics that you see line up with that basis. Within the MCR specifically, the midpoint of our guide obviously has a slight up-tick from where we were in 2023. Now important to step back and thank the 2023 MCR performance was favorable to expectations and the primary driver of the Cigna Healthcare income outperformance. We're just really pleased with the both quarter and full year coming in favorable to expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the 81.3% full year MCR was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of where we had started the guidance early in 2023. So you can think of the primary driver of the slightly higher projected 2024 MCR as being our stop-loss products within the U.S. Commercial Employer business. As I mentioned earlier, these ran favorable to our target profit margins in 2023. And due to lower-than-expected cost trends in high-dollar claimants. For 2024, our planning assumptions are for the stop-loss products to normalize back into their typical target profit margin range. Secondarily, there is some product mix shift within the Cigna Health care portfolio between 2023 and 2024 that will impact the overall Cigna Healthcare MCR. Although, I would note that we expect the overall Cigna Healthcare profit margin percentage to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023. And we'd expect that to land near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range in 2024. And then finally, when you think about our MCR guidance, as always, our guidance does have an appropriate level of prudence to start off the year.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get back to the Healthcare Services Corp. divestiture. Why was the PDP asset included in that sale? I would have thought that, that would have had strategic value on the Evernorth side and that you have an advantage on the cost structure. And then similarly, including Care allies as well, was that more a tie-in to the Medicare Advantage business? And what does that mean for broad sort of value-based care network development at Cigna?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning Josh, it's David. Let me take a portion of your question and then ask Eric to expand. And I'm going to come at the latter piece of it in terms of care allies and BBC, et cetera. First, your statement is correct. The thing about the care allies is specifically focused on the MA portion of value-based care. So therefore, there's alignment there. Stepping back on value-based care, we have a long history and again, a proven track record of delivering very strong positive results for the benefit of our clients, our customers and patients off of our value-based care orientation for commercial, for individual exchange, as well as for Medicare Advantage. As you know from our prior conversations, that's been a partner and enabled model as opposed to an owned model, broadly speaking. In terms of owning the care delivery versus partnering enabling. Additionally, I'd ask you to think about the commitment around that continuing. So our collaborative accountable care relationships for our commercial business and our exchange business continues on and our investment in and expansion of our Evernorth Accountable Care of capabilities as we support healthcare delivery system partners around their value-based care. That continues, including our strategic partnership with Village. So on the value-based care side of the equation, no change in strategy for us. this specific subset of our assets was solely aligned to the Medicare Advantage business. I'll ask Eric to talk about the direction relative to PDP and our multidimensional services relationship there. Eric?\nEric Palmer: Thanks, David, and good morning, Josh. So two things I would note for you, Josh here. First of all, as David and Brian had in their prepared remarks, we will have a multiyear services relationship between Evernorth and HCSC building on a relationship that already exists there. So Evernorth will have the opportunity to continue to provide services associated not only with the prescription drug element of this business, but some of the other clinical coordination and related capabilities. So we're excited about that opportunity working to grow together. Specifically to the employer PDP item, you should think of here is Express Scripts continuing to be the face of the employer offerings and this being seamless with all of our clients and services with the role that will be played here around the insurance dynamics going to HCSC. But again, this will be a set of relationships that Express Scripts and Evernorth will continue to manage from a relationship and account management perspective, and we'll continue to be very involved in an area of focus for us. So overall, I'm very excited about the opportunity to continue to grow with another partner here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks, good morning. Interested just now with the sale of the MA business, how your priorities for investment and for growth in Cigna Healthcare may change from that? And obviously, you talked about how you've invested a lot in Medicare. So that should free up capital to invest in other businesses. So curious in terms of how you're thinking about where you can increase investment for growth in Cigna Healthcare, but also just how you're thinking about the exchange business now against the exit from MA just around your overall risk business in Cigna Healthcare will now be probably more weighted towards text, which is a pretty volatile business. So curious just on your thinking about the exchange business and sort of how you - how now you're going to sort of view that business post the sell VMA? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Scott, good morning, it's David. I think your umbrella tenant is right. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, the decision allows for sharpening of focus as we lean into our portfolio going forward. As you think about the investments, though, we have a long track record of making multiyear investments within our portfolio. So think about investments in a digital-first orientation and data-led capabilities continuing to invest in development of new programs and capabilities, be it what we talked about before with ClearCare or Pathwell capabilities. expanding the infrastructure and scale for a broader addressable market expansion and our proven CuraScript SD expansion as we face off and support a broadening array of health care professionals and integrated delivery systems. And I mentioned to Josh, the Evernorth Accountable Care capability. So think about, broadly speaking, our investment strategy continuing to fuel a variety of items and finally, sustained affordability, be it on the medical class pharmacy cost for administrative leverage that we get out of machine learning and AI through that lens. As it relates to the question around exchange or otherwise, we've always viewed the exchange business as sitting between commercial as well as the government. Obviously, the government influences a meaningful portion of that through the benefit design and otherwise, yet we are able to successfully leverage our collaborative accountable care relationships. And as we've demonstrated now for about a decade, with the exchange business by taking a very targeted focus within that market from its inception in 2014 to today, we continue to see that as a complementary aspect to our business. We will take very targeted positions, market by market as long as we have the right collaborative care relationships in place and have to be a complementary part of our portfolio. So I don't see the exchange posture is changing as a result of this. And broadly speaking, I don't think the investment strategy and the corporation changes as a result of it, it does create more capacity, though, as you articulated to accelerate in some of the categories I made reference to. I hope that helps, Scott.\nScott Fidel: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give a little more color about the membership guidance for 2024 by product. I know you're repricing exchanges, how is commercial going within commercial, the subsegments and then and then a little more color on the Medicare Advantage volume expectations, and I guess that's in the guidance as well. Thanks. \nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the net decline we have projected in the 2024 Cigna Healthcare customers. You can think of the primary driver of this being the individual exchange business. As we discussed late last year, we took some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in the individual exchange portfolio, and this will result in net customer declines for this business in 2024. Within the U.S. Commercial Employer business, we expect customer volumes to be up modestly. But you should think of this by subsegment being split a bit. So we expect to see a net decline in our national accounts business, but this will be more than offset by the continued strong growth within our Select segment. And as a reminder, we continue to see opportunities for above-market growth in the Select segment, where our market share is still just 7%. And - when you think about the MA customer volume specifically, as we approach the 2024 bid cycle, as we always do, we apply a local market county level approach relative to how we price and set benefits. And so for most geographies, this resulted in stable benefits. A few areas, we had some targeted pullbacks just in light of the funding environment in 2024. And what we saw was in some of our local geographies, there was some very aggressive competitor behavior, which resulted in less net growth than what we had originally expected for the Medicare Advantage business. So taken all together, we would expect to see net customer volumes down slightly for year-end 2024 in comparison to year-end 2023 within the Medicare Advantage space specifically. But when you put all these pieces together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare business right now is we expect to see profit margins expand year-over-year as I mentioned earlier, while we're serving a meaningful volume of customers that's grown markedly over the last two years.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. On Evernorth, how are you thinking about the implications of cost-plus models and what that means at the PBM level and how does that influence your discussions with customers? Or just around your pharmacy network relationships. And just more broadly, just around transparency. And obviously, you talked about that in your prepared remarks in more transparent offerings at the PBM level and how do you think those offerings are gaining or not getting traction across your customer base? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Hi Erin, its Eric. First of all, just would not fundamentally, we start with the portfolio and approach that's equipped to offer a choice and - flexibility in how we work to support our clients. And so, that's the lens I ground back to. We're always open to looking at new ways and approaches and such that drive increased affordability and meets the needs of our buyers. And I'm really proud of the range of different financing solutions we offer and the number of innovations that we've delivered in 2023 and already in 2024 in terms of the types of options that we bring to our clients. And in fact, as David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we launched our clear network solution, which was its first of its kind. It's comprehensive and simple solution to providing a cost index-based pharmacy network. A solution is unique in that it provides access to all the drugs in pricing that's based off of independent externally created cost on disease, kind of a simple margin that's shared between us and the dispensing pharmacy. So use that as an example. We had a lot of good conversations about that as a program and as an offering, but would note that the selling seasons for these types of things tend to be long in time. It's a long lead time in terms of implementation of such. So, some good conversations with our clients on solutions like that. Looking at other changes in the ecosystem, overall, with note, our clients are demanding more for their healthcare dollars. And are looking for ways to improve affordability overall and broadly are not interested in paying more for the same services that they received today. We've got a wide variety of networks and solutions that exist already in the market and the flexibility to adapt and adjust the configuration of our networks to trade-off costs relative to the value and access profiles that exist. So overall, we've got good flexibility, good capabilities and modularity to be able to approach and line up our capabilities best with what our clients need.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a broader strategic question beyond MA. Most of your peers set up their business models over the last five to 10 years to manage a significant amount of their internal healthcare spend, right, and drive additional profitability and revenue from those services businesses. So with the sale of MA, you're repricing your exchanges which, makes sense, but your risk membership and the amount of medical costs you control, right, and are able to run through your services business just declines. How do you think about the value there are those individual synergies of controlling medical costs and being able to provide services there, the natural growth it provides each and every year, versus having to go out into the market and win each and every piece of business of growth, which obviously you've done pretty well over the last few years, but just the stability of kind of having that internal membership? And how should investors expect this to impact your capital deployment strategy going forward? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Justin, good morning, it's David. There's a lot in your question. Let me try to frame our thought process today and as we go forward. First, to date, we have a very clear proven track record of delivering a total cost, total quality, including clinical quality and service quality solution that resonates really well in the marketplace, whether it's in the benefit side of the equation or on the services side of the equation and our results reinforce that. Point two is we've successfully executed an approach that is on the delivery and fulfillment, a mix of partner and owned we continue to evolve our portfolio. But philosophically, we do not believe have not, do not and continue to not believe that you have to own everything to be able to fulfill. As you might recall, if you reflect back on prior conversations within our portfolio at Investor Days, we framed actually the amount of services that Evernorth, for example, was fulfilling at a point in time for the Signet Healthcare portfolio. And we frame the expansion opportunity to the point of your question that existed in front of us, and we continue to expand those services. Our model though is also importantly not predicated on only having economic alignment for guaranteed cost. We're able to do it successfully for self-funded or shared funding mechanism as well. So point two is we see the ability to continue to grow that over time with our Evernorth services portfolio. Point three is as it relates to services to continue to invest in. We've been very clear that certain services, we see additional step function opportunities to invest in and continue to grow. Most importantly, our proven scale, specialty capabilities. The rate of spending growth and clinical complexity around that is off the charts. We have a leadership position there that will continue to grow, and we will continue to be the market leader in that space through our assets. Secondly, the need statements around behavioral health in the most comprehensive way. The market expects now a much more coordination of behavioral and physical health and we will continue to expand services that we have within our leading capabilities. And third, just to stop at three for illustration is the breadth of virtual services. the ability to connect and coordinate and expand services as we go forward. So we agree with your point. I'll end with agreement with your point of continuing to invest in our services capabilities to be able to support the right services but we do not believe you have to own all aspects of the care delivery equation to be able to deliver that on a go-forward basis. So hopefully, that gives you a framing. As you might expect, we'll spend time on this at our Investor Day on the seventh because it's an important part of our strategy today and an important part of our growth strategy going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about over in the Cigna Healthcare side of the business employer, how penetration rates are going with the specialty products in self-insured? And if there are any interesting trends as you go into 2024 here as you look at the selling season in 2025 with respect to that. And then as you've gone through the selling season, any changes in employer priorities? And then also just a quick clarification on if you could just explain, there's a little drop in fees in the PBM. So that was just a clarification. The other one is a real question. Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Lance, it's Brian. I'll take the majority of your question. I think there's a number of different pieces in there. As it relates to the specialty products, and the attachment, if you will, to the medical in the Cigna Healthcare book of business, as you know, has been a long-standing part of the company's strategy because we see the value of clinical integration being much greater when we have multiple components of relationship with an employer. So that's been for many years, part of the company strategy. And important to bifurcate that by subsegment, certainly in the down market, we call the Select segment under 500. Most of those employers tend to buy the entirety of our offerings at once. So we have very high user work penetration rates in the under 500 and then comparatively lower when you get to the national account space where there tends to be a little bit more a la carte purchasing of the different services. So broadly speaking, I would say those patterns haven't changed too much over the last few years. On your question on the selling season, in particular and some of the employer preferences the 2024 selling season is largely over with the exception of the Select segment. As I mentioned earlier, that's an area for us that continues to grow at above market rates, and we're really pleased with. As we look forward to the 2025 selling season, we do have some national account RFPs in-house for both some existing clients and new business prospects. And directionally, RFP volumes are up a bit from prior years. Now each of these large clients, as you can appreciate, tend to have unique needs. That said, there are a few areas that I would highlight for purposes of kind of themes. So one would be some of our larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. So we tend to call that point solution fatigue. You may hear Eric or I talk about. Secondly, a team that's been around mental health and substance abuse benefits as these programs have become more and more important to employers from the standpoint of managing productivity, absences and overall health of their employee base. And thirdly, many of the larger employers are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to further power things like site of care optimization and consumer empowerment at the time that, that care is delivered. So we continue to see interest in those areas as well as various provider network configurations that may optimize cost quality and/or incentive alignment between the provider and the finance here. So our Cigna Healthcare offerings are really well positioned to address these themes and the demand from large employers will simultaneously continue to grow share in the under 500 select segment. I think David wants to add a few comments here. \nDavid Cordani: Sure. Just to amplify and add one more. The amplification is that point solution fatigue, that plays through in terms of opportunities for our Evernorth team as well as our Cigna Healthcare team. So around that, think about the ability to leverage solutions to get more value, better service, better clinical outcomes, overall value and affordability. Secondly I just wanted to reinforce a critical point when we think about penetration or cross-selling, sometimes it's thought through and you didn't state this, but sometimes it to through under the notion of you're just cross-selling products. The integration of the products to deliver more value to the clients and customers is mission-critical. So that shows up in better service quality, better clinical quality, improved affordability. And I would highlight that our sustained differentiated MLR performance is, in many cases, aided by our proven ability to integrate certain services they come together with benefit the clients that enables us to generate a high level of cross-selling and a high level of penetration. Thanks, Lance\nLance Wilkes: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with TD Cowen. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. David, I was hoping to ask an action-packed question like A.J. did, but I'm afraid I'm going to be to in the weeds for that. I just want to go back to stop-loss, because it looks like a pretty substantial benefit to the 4Q and headwind. When I just look at how much your fourth quarter MLR outperformed your typical seasonal pattern, particularly in a quarter where there was broad trend acceleration? And then I try to square how much ACA enrollment and margin improvement should drive a tailwind 24 MLRs should actually decline year-over-year, but you're guiding it up. I mean it gets me to hundreds and hundreds of basis points of variance around stop-loss. So could you quantify how much that helped 4Q and how much of a headwind that is for 24? And then the second part would just be, walk us through again why you had such favorable performance in that line?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning Gary, its Brian. So, as it relates to the stop-loss book, as you know, this is a really important part of the Cigna Health care portfolio, and we finished 2023 with $6 billion of premium in that product line which to the earlier question, Lance attaches itself to our self-funded offerings in many instances. This book will naturally have some variability to it. So I wouldn't get overly fixated on 1 quarter's performance. There tends to be a little bit more settlement activity that transpires in the fourth quarter. So we had a little bit more of the favorability work its way through in the quarter, whereas if you smooth out over the course of the year, you don't have quite the same dynamic, which is one of the reasons why when you do the bridge from 23% to 24%, you shouldn't run rate the fourth quarter experience from that standpoint. So I mentioned earlier some of the moving pieces in the year-over-year MCR reconciliation, the 90 basis points increase from where we landed at the end of 2023 to the midpoint of the 24% guide. A key component of that 90 basis points is an up-tick that were anticipated in the stop-loss product which to the point earlier, is a function of our assumption that, that will normalize back to more traditional levels of profitability on the stop-loss products. So I think that's broadly the way I would encourage you to think about the dynamics at play here with that product line.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. You may ask your question.\nDave Windley: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I appreciate that. The premise of my question here is that your Evernorth profit guidance for 2024 looks pretty highly visible to us. So my questions underneath that are one that you had guided 23% to include a ramping contribution from biosimilar, how should we expect that to continue, should that continue to ramp in magnitude? A then the second part was the significant onboarding costs for the Centene contract in 2023. Are you fully past those? Are those completely gone? Brian, you mentioned some Evernorth onboarding maybe unrelated, but Evernorth onboarding. In your remarks, I just wanted to kind of understand the relative size of those, so those two things, please.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning. It's David. Let me ask Brian to give you a framing in terms of - because you have a question relative to the trajectory in the year-over-year? And then I'll ask Brian to hand it across to Eric to give you a little bit more color of your question. The onboarding costs that, were really intense during 2023. And then some of what we're calling onboarding costs that leads into the early part of 2000 and 2024, give you a little color of what those services look like. But I'll ask Brian to frame the financials first.\nBrian Evanko: Yes. Thanks, David. Good morning, Dave. So overall, our AOI growth in Evernorth is expected to be about 9% as implied by the $7 billion or more of income that we expect in the year. And you can think of that as having the benefit of Centene related costs, now essentially normalizing back to a point where the profitability of that relationship will be in the range of breakeven. And then on top of that, we will have income performance. That's more in line with our traditional algorithm of 5% to 7% average annual income growth. And that reflects the benefit of all the multiyear trends that Eric talked about earlier, whether those be biosimilars, GLP-1 drugs, specialty generics, et cetera. So we certainly are seeing continued benefit from the biosimilar wave in 2024. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a specific and unique effect of the large amount of additional volume we're getting with the new client relationships in 2024. So Eric, maybe you can expand on that dynamic a bit.\nEric Palmer: Great. Thanks, Brian. So with Centene, first, I would just start by actually noting how proud I am of how our team has delivered here and how we worked collaboratively across and with the Centene team. It's really been a great effort and one that's come together really nicely for the benefit of our now shared customers. implementation has gone really well, and the first month has been quite successful. Now consistent with what we've said before, and as Brian just noted, in 2023, we had meaningful implementation spending and no associated revenue generated a loss 2024. We have results that will be approximately breakeven in 2025. We expect to achieve our run rate margin for this contract, which will be lower than the overall of the business. With respect to the year 2024 timing that Brian alluded to before, you should just think about this, there's a lot more activity that has to happen at the beginning of a contract like this. There's more client outreach. There's work to get individuals into their therapies, et cetera. So there's normal effect here of just additional work and activity that has to take place in the first part of the year, and our expenses will reflect that. So that's a bit of that in-year shaping. But it's all consistent with what we had shared before. The final thing I'd note is consistent with our kind of normal practice now that Centene is a live client of ours won't be commenting going forward on specific profitability of a specific client or things along those lines, but know that the trajectory here is off to the same start we expected and consistent with what we had talked about previously.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks. Just a couple of messages to reiterate. First and foremost, 2023 was clearly a strong year of performance across our company as we executed quite well, and it's reinforced by more than a decade where we've executed consistently as we've evolved our company and continue to grow our business portfolio and those we serve. We have confidence that we're going to sustain that momentum and leverage our well-balanced portfolio across our franchise and continue to deliver within our 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth range as well as pay an attractive dividend. Finally, I want to thank my coworkers around the world for their continued disciplined execution, their passion, importantly, in their caring orientation as well as dedication for those we serve. It shows up in our results. I'm really pleased and proud of what we delivered in 2023. And importantly, I'm even more excited for our expansion of our reach and impact in 2024. As a final note for you all, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day, which is a month away. So in early March, we look forward to seeing you in New York City and our team will be excited to talk about the market expansion we see in front of us, our capabilities and our opportunity to create additional value on a go-forward basis. Have a great day. Thanks. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's fourth quarter 2023 results review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79. These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth. As our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers. Fourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023. And our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023, reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo specialty pharmacy. Now turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution. Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our stop-loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025, following regulatory approvals. And our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance, and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance. This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare, primarily from U.S. commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disrupted market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically. We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings. The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7%, with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the Enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of Enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio. And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1% and an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now, framing our 2024 capital outlook, we expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures. And we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to, repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $282 million to 286 million shares. Now to recap, our full year 2023, consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator, for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning George, its Brian. So let me just take the MA question first and then I'll get into the MCR. So as noted in my comments earlier, the Medicare Advantage business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare through 2024. So all of our guidance whether that be the revenue guidance, the customer volume guidance, the earnings guidance, all assumes that the Medicare business will continue to be reported through Cigna Healthcare on an asset held-for-sale basis so, just to clarify that. So, all the metrics that you see line up with that basis. Within the MCR specifically, the midpoint of our guide obviously has a slight up-tick from where we were in 2023. Now important to step back and thank the 2023 MCR performance was favorable to expectations and the primary driver of the Cigna Healthcare income outperformance. We're just really pleased with the both quarter and full year coming in favorable to expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the 81.3% full year MCR was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of where we had started the guidance early in 2023. So you can think of the primary driver of the slightly higher projected 2024 MCR as being our stop-loss products within the U.S. Commercial Employer business. As I mentioned earlier, these ran favorable to our target profit margins in 2023. And due to lower-than-expected cost trends in high-dollar claimants. For 2024, our planning assumptions are for the stop-loss products to normalize back into their typical target profit margin range. Secondarily, there is some product mix shift within the Cigna Health care portfolio between 2023 and 2024 that will impact the overall Cigna Healthcare MCR. Although, I would note that we expect the overall Cigna Healthcare profit margin percentage to be higher in 2024 compared to 2023. And we'd expect that to land near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range in 2024. And then finally, when you think about our MCR guidance, as always, our guidance does have an appropriate level of prudence to start off the year. Good morning, Kevin, it's Brian. So as it relates to the net decline we have projected in the 2024 Cigna Healthcare customers. You can think of the primary driver of this being the individual exchange business. As we discussed late last year, we took some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in the individual exchange portfolio, and this will result in net customer declines for this business in 2024. Within the U.S. Commercial Employer business, we expect customer volumes to be up modestly. But you should think of this by subsegment being split a bit. So we expect to see a net decline in our national accounts business, but this will be more than offset by the continued strong growth within our Select segment. And as a reminder, we continue to see opportunities for above-market growth in the Select segment, where our market share is still just 7%. And - when you think about the MA customer volume specifically, as we approach the 2024 bid cycle, as we always do, we apply a local market county level approach relative to how we price and set benefits. And so for most geographies, this resulted in stable benefits. A few areas, we had some targeted pullbacks just in light of the funding environment in 2024. And what we saw was in some of our local geographies, there was some very aggressive competitor behavior, which resulted in less net growth than what we had originally expected for the Medicare Advantage business. So taken all together, we would expect to see net customer volumes down slightly for year-end 2024 in comparison to year-end 2023 within the Medicare Advantage space specifically. But when you put all these pieces together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare business right now is we expect to see profit margins expand year-over-year as I mentioned earlier, while we're serving a meaningful volume of customers that's grown markedly over the last two years. Good morning, Lance, it's Brian. I'll take the majority of your question. I think there's a number of different pieces in there. As it relates to the specialty products, and the attachment, if you will, to the medical in the Cigna Healthcare book of business, as you know, has been a long-standing part of the company's strategy because we see the value of clinical integration being much greater when we have multiple components of relationship with an employer. So that's been for many years, part of the company strategy. And important to bifurcate that by subsegment, certainly in the down market, we call the Select segment under 500. Most of those employers tend to buy the entirety of our offerings at once. So we have very high user work penetration rates in the under 500 and then comparatively lower when you get to the national account space where there tends to be a little bit more a la carte purchasing of the different services. So broadly speaking, I would say those patterns haven't changed too much over the last few years. On your question on the selling season, in particular and some of the employer preferences the 2024 selling season is largely over with the exception of the Select segment. As I mentioned earlier, that's an area for us that continues to grow at above market rates, and we're really pleased with. As we look forward to the 2025 selling season, we do have some national account RFPs in-house for both some existing clients and new business prospects. And directionally, RFP volumes are up a bit from prior years. Now each of these large clients, as you can appreciate, tend to have unique needs. That said, there are a few areas that I would highlight for purposes of kind of themes. So one would be some of our larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. So we tend to call that point solution fatigue. You may hear Eric or I talk about. Secondly, a team that's been around mental health and substance abuse benefits as these programs have become more and more important to employers from the standpoint of managing productivity, absences and overall health of their employee base. And thirdly, many of the larger employers are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to further power things like site of care optimization and consumer empowerment at the time that, that care is delivered. So we continue to see interest in those areas as well as various provider network configurations that may optimize cost quality and/or incentive alignment between the provider and the finance here. So our Cigna Healthcare offerings are really well positioned to address these themes and the demand from large employers will simultaneously continue to grow share in the under 500 select segment. I think David wants to add a few comments here. Good morning Gary, its Brian. So, as it relates to the stop-loss book, as you know, this is a really important part of the Cigna Health care portfolio, and we finished 2023 with $6 billion of premium in that product line which to the earlier question, Lance attaches itself to our self-funded offerings in many instances. This book will naturally have some variability to it. So I wouldn't get overly fixated on 1 quarter's performance. There tends to be a little bit more settlement activity that transpires in the fourth quarter. So we had a little bit more of the favorability work its way through in the quarter, whereas if you smooth out over the course of the year, you don't have quite the same dynamic, which is one of the reasons why when you do the bridge from 23% to 24%, you shouldn't run rate the fourth quarter experience from that standpoint. So I mentioned earlier some of the moving pieces in the year-over-year MCR reconciliation, the 90 basis points increase from where we landed at the end of 2023 to the midpoint of the 24% guide. A key component of that 90 basis points is an up-tick that were anticipated in the stop-loss product which to the point earlier, is a function of our assumption that, that will normalize back to more traditional levels of profitability on the stop-loss products. So I think that's broadly the way I would encourage you to think about the dynamics at play here with that product line. Yes. Thanks, David. Good morning, Dave. So overall, our AOI growth in Evernorth is expected to be about 9% as implied by the $7 billion or more of income that we expect in the year. And you can think of that as having the benefit of Centene related costs, now essentially normalizing back to a point where the profitability of that relationship will be in the range of breakeven. And then on top of that, we will have income performance. That's more in line with our traditional algorithm of 5% to 7% average annual income growth. And that reflects the benefit of all the multiyear trends that Eric talked about earlier, whether those be biosimilars, GLP-1 drugs, specialty generics, et cetera. So we certainly are seeing continued benefit from the biosimilar wave in 2024. But as I mentioned earlier, there's a bit of a specific and unique effect of the large amount of additional volume we're getting with the new client relationships in 2024. So Eric, maybe you can expand on that dynamic a bit."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners in the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth. Now today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth. Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions. Now before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals.  And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses well large at about $12 billion in revenue would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio. Additionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare. Now as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion, and disciplined pricing activity. Now with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines. Probably for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results, in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis. In the five years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year. And we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments. In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and growth. Now I'll discuss our performance in greater detail. I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication, so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling, well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that were ready to serve in 2024 and I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and of the clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023, is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation. Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice as well as independent Rx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we have further an expanding choice for clients funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts clear network. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results. With Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically compliant specialty drugs. We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it, while also remaining connected with physical sense of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting the growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities were valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers. In Cigna Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system. Our leading clinical care programs could use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulting in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. In international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high-quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Now turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses. Pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group. We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Second, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments. And within Care Services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care, as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions. In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $20.25, we expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcement we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past three years and will continue in that role. He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group, while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions, as well as other leadership changes we announced provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy, as well as the extent of reach and impact lucid to have. Importantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Cigna Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth. Now I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we are raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We are building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We have sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we are positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We are building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $28.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024. We'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target, while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Thank you. Good morning. It's David. You have a lot in that question. And I appreciate it. Let me try to address some of the high points. First and foremost, we are really pleased with the nature of the transaction we're able to structure with HCSC. We see it as a win-win. And it's a clarification to our strategy within our portfolio. As I noted in my prepared remarks while we view the market as an attractive growth market. The required capital investment resources focus relative to its size within our portfolio, coupled with the continued elevated regulatory environment, our decision was it was best to enter this transaction. Point two is, very importantly, we've been quite deliberate now for several years, working to expand the service portfolio and the value proposition within Evernorth for health plan partners as it relates to their government services, be it Medicare, be it duals, be it Medicaid, et cetera.  And we're demonstrating a very attractive proven track record of growing our government reach but through the services franchise, and we will continue to fuel that on a go-forward basis and see that as an attractive trajectory for us. As it relates to your latter part of your question, I'll reframe our M&A criteria. I want to make sure I put that in the context of our capital deployment criteria. We continue to view, first, capital deployment priorities, investing in our business. Brian referenced the CapEx deployment of about $1.5 billion. Second, we always evaluate M&A for its appropriate attributes, which I'll come back to in a moment. And then third, returning capital to shareholders. And as Brian noted, in 2024, in addition to raising our dividend by 14%, we expect to return the majority of our excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase with at least $5 billion in the first half of the year. Lastly, in your action pack question, as we think about the criteria for transactions, we think about three criteria: first, strategic attraction; second, financial attraction; and then third, overall path to clarity. So is it strategically aligned? Is it financially attractive? And as a final note, when we think about the financial piece of the equation, you evaluate each deal on its own respective merits. But seeking to get high visibility in terms of your value creation for your organization if you're going to enter into a transaction. So to repeat, we're pleased with the decision and the transaction design. We will continue in a long-term service relationship with HCSC that further expands our proven track record within Evernorth. We see the Evernorth service portfolio as an attractive capital-light high visibility way to grow this portfolio. And as we have in the past, we will maintain very strong discipline for capital deployment and our 2024 capital deployment priorities are quite clear. Thanks. Steve, good morning, it's David. You're asking for a 10-year crystal ball. I think in the dynamism of the marketplace, most people come back to in terms of rolling three-year views of a given market. But stepping back, first and foremost, the Medicare Advantage offering, broadly speaking, in the marketplace is a very attractive offering for seniors. And it has a long-term proven track record of delivering attractive benefits. And importantly, clinical coordination when you get to the Medicare beneficiaries, typically dealing with a higher level of clinical burden that's necessary for coordination. And the care outcomes, the quality outcomes, the overall value outcomes are positive. So broadly speaking, from a societal standpoint, we see MA as an important asset for the U.S. to continue to be served, supported financially and grow. Secondly, the marketplace will see ebbs and flows in terms of the funding mechanism. We see the early look at the rate letter at the moment in time. That's a moment in time, either acceleration or potentially deceleration for that marketplace. Third is, if you look at the senior satisfaction level, NPS broadly - Net Promoter Score broadly is attractive for Medicare Advantage. Therefore, as I noted previously to A.J.'s point, we worked really aggressively to ensure that we have a broad and we will continue to broaden the portfolio of services in support of health plans and integrated value-based care providers to be in support of value-based care, be it for Medicare Advantage tools or the commercial population. So we see the marketplace as a growth market. Its respective growth will ebb and flow depending on reimbursement to some level from the government, lending toward benefit richness. And then ultimately, as you know, the last comment I would make is the primary wave of the baby boomer aging has reached a peak and is slowing. It's still attractive, but that primary wave has reached its peak and is slowing somewhat. Take it as a whole, we see this as an expansion opportunity for Evernorth. Good morning Josh, it's David. Let me take a portion of your question and then ask Eric to expand. And I'm going to come at the latter piece of it in terms of care allies and BBC, et cetera. First, your statement is correct. The thing about the care allies is specifically focused on the MA portion of value-based care. So therefore, there's alignment there. Stepping back on value-based care, we have a long history and again, a proven track record of delivering very strong positive results for the benefit of our clients, our customers and patients off of our value-based care orientation for commercial, for individual exchange, as well as for Medicare Advantage. As you know from our prior conversations, that's been a partner and enabled model as opposed to an owned model, broadly speaking. In terms of owning the care delivery versus partnering enabling. Additionally, I'd ask you to think about the commitment around that continuing. So our collaborative accountable care relationships for our commercial business and our exchange business continues on and our investment in and expansion of our Evernorth Accountable Care of capabilities as we support healthcare delivery system partners around their value-based care. That continues, including our strategic partnership with Village. So on the value-based care side of the equation, no change in strategy for us. this specific subset of our assets was solely aligned to the Medicare Advantage business. I'll ask Eric to talk about the direction relative to PDP and our multidimensional services relationship there. Eric? Scott, good morning, it's David. I think your umbrella tenant is right. So as I noted in my prepared remarks, the decision allows for sharpening of focus as we lean into our portfolio going forward. As you think about the investments, though, we have a long track record of making multiyear investments within our portfolio. So think about investments in a digital-first orientation and data-led capabilities continuing to invest in development of new programs and capabilities, be it what we talked about before with ClearCare or Pathwell capabilities. expanding the infrastructure and scale for a broader addressable market expansion and our proven CuraScript SD expansion as we face off and support a broadening array of health care professionals and integrated delivery systems. And I mentioned to Josh, the Evernorth Accountable Care capability. So think about, broadly speaking, our investment strategy continuing to fuel a variety of items and finally, sustained affordability, be it on the medical class pharmacy cost for administrative leverage that we get out of machine learning and AI through that lens. As it relates to the question around exchange or otherwise, we've always viewed the exchange business as sitting between commercial as well as the government. Obviously, the government influences a meaningful portion of that through the benefit design and otherwise, yet we are able to successfully leverage our collaborative accountable care relationships. And as we've demonstrated now for about a decade, with the exchange business by taking a very targeted focus within that market from its inception in 2014 to today, we continue to see that as a complementary aspect to our business. We will take very targeted positions, market by market as long as we have the right collaborative care relationships in place and have to be a complementary part of our portfolio. So I don't see the exchange posture is changing as a result of this. And broadly speaking, I don't think the investment strategy and the corporation changes as a result of it, it does create more capacity, though, as you articulated to accelerate in some of the categories I made reference to. I hope that helps, Scott. Justin, good morning, it's David. There's a lot in your question. Let me try to frame our thought process today and as we go forward. First, to date, we have a very clear proven track record of delivering a total cost, total quality, including clinical quality and service quality solution that resonates really well in the marketplace, whether it's in the benefit side of the equation or on the services side of the equation and our results reinforce that. Point two is we've successfully executed an approach that is on the delivery and fulfillment, a mix of partner and owned we continue to evolve our portfolio. But philosophically, we do not believe have not, do not and continue to not believe that you have to own everything to be able to fulfill. As you might recall, if you reflect back on prior conversations within our portfolio at Investor Days, we framed actually the amount of services that Evernorth, for example, was fulfilling at a point in time for the Signet Healthcare portfolio. And we frame the expansion opportunity to the point of your question that existed in front of us, and we continue to expand those services. Our model though is also importantly not predicated on only having economic alignment for guaranteed cost. We're able to do it successfully for self-funded or shared funding mechanism as well. So point two is we see the ability to continue to grow that over time with our Evernorth services portfolio. Point three is as it relates to services to continue to invest in. We've been very clear that certain services, we see additional step function opportunities to invest in and continue to grow. Most importantly, our proven scale, specialty capabilities. The rate of spending growth and clinical complexity around that is off the charts. We have a leadership position there that will continue to grow, and we will continue to be the market leader in that space through our assets. Secondly, the need statements around behavioral health in the most comprehensive way. The market expects now a much more coordination of behavioral and physical health and we will continue to expand services that we have within our leading capabilities. And third, just to stop at three for illustration is the breadth of virtual services. the ability to connect and coordinate and expand services as we go forward. So we agree with your point. I'll end with agreement with your point of continuing to invest in our services capabilities to be able to support the right services but we do not believe you have to own all aspects of the care delivery equation to be able to deliver that on a go-forward basis. So hopefully, that gives you a framing. As you might expect, we'll spend time on this at our Investor Day on the seventh because it's an important part of our strategy today and an important part of our growth strategy going forward. Sure. Just to amplify and add one more. The amplification is that point solution fatigue, that plays through in terms of opportunities for our Evernorth team as well as our Cigna Healthcare team. So around that, think about the ability to leverage solutions to get more value, better service, better clinical outcomes, overall value and affordability. Secondly I just wanted to reinforce a critical point when we think about penetration or cross-selling, sometimes it's thought through and you didn't state this, but sometimes it to through under the notion of you're just cross-selling products. The integration of the products to deliver more value to the clients and customers is mission-critical. So that shows up in better service quality, better clinical quality, improved affordability. And I would highlight that our sustained differentiated MLR performance is, in many cases, aided by our proven ability to integrate certain services they come together with benefit the clients that enables us to generate a high level of cross-selling and a high level of penetration. Thanks, Lance Good morning. It's David. Let me ask Brian to give you a framing in terms of - because you have a question relative to the trajectory in the year-over-year? And then I'll ask Brian to hand it across to Eric to give you a little bit more color of your question. The onboarding costs that, were really intense during 2023. And then some of what we're calling onboarding costs that leads into the early part of 2000 and 2024, give you a little color of what those services look like. But I'll ask Brian to frame the financials first. Thanks. Just a couple of messages to reiterate. First and foremost, 2023 was clearly a strong year of performance across our company as we executed quite well, and it's reinforced by more than a decade where we've executed consistently as we've evolved our company and continue to grow our business portfolio and those we serve. We have confidence that we're going to sustain that momentum and leverage our well-balanced portfolio across our franchise and continue to deliver within our 10% to 13% long-term EPS growth range as well as pay an attractive dividend. Finally, I want to thank my coworkers around the world for their continued disciplined execution, their passion, importantly, in their caring orientation as well as dedication for those we serve. It shows up in our results. I'm really pleased and proud of what we delivered in 2023. And importantly, I'm even more excited for our expansion of our reach and impact in 2024. As a final note for you all, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day, which is a month away. So in early March, we look forward to seeing you in New York City and our team will be excited to talk about the market expansion we see in front of us, our capabilities and our opportunity to create additional value on a go-forward basis. Have a great day. Thanks."

            "name": "Eric Palmer",
            "content": "Thanks, Lisa. Good morning. It's Eric. A couple of different pieces in there. But first, let me just talk a bit about the portfolio of services that we're focused on in terms of Evernorth and transition that into some of the drivers of growth specifically for 2024. David noted in his prepared remarks, a couple of highlights on capabilities we're growing. But I would call out, we are seeing significant interest from the market around teams helping to better coordinate individual point solutions and alleviate some of the burden that comes along with the fragmentation of how care is administered and how employers and plans are assembling care. So us working to improve navigation and reduce point solution fatigue is a key item. Second of all, I would note, behavioral care continues to be an area of focus, and there's meaningful opportunity for behavioral care to be better coordinated as there's significant comorbidities with individuals with mental health care needs, along with other care needs, and we're in a position to help us address those challenges. The third item I'd note would be around specialty and in particular, the opportunity for us to continue to grow as there are more therapies, more choices in the specialty market as well as navigating through biosimilars. Overall, we're positioned really well to continue to drive affordability and choice in biosimilars. And as we've talked about previously, that's an important long-term multi-year tailwind in the economics and the growth of Evernorth overall. And then certainly, the continued growth in therapies like GLP-1s are is an area that's a factor in our proposition overall. So you put together that kind of touched on a number of the different capabilities. When you put together that suite of capabilities, that ends up being a really attractive portfolio that we've had continued growth in the number of lives we're serving, growth in our clients' lives that enable us to deliver the numbers that we're talking about. Overall, really excited about the momentum we've got going into 2024 and see ourselves as well positioned to deliver there and continue the trajectory beyond. Thanks, David, and good morning, Josh. So two things I would note for you, Josh here. First of all, as David and Brian had in their prepared remarks, we will have a multiyear services relationship between Evernorth and HCSC building on a relationship that already exists there. So Evernorth will have the opportunity to continue to provide services associated not only with the prescription drug element of this business, but some of the other clinical coordination and related capabilities. So we're excited about that opportunity working to grow together. Specifically to the employer PDP item, you should think of here is Express Scripts continuing to be the face of the employer offerings and this being seamless with all of our clients and services with the role that will be played here around the insurance dynamics going to HCSC. But again, this will be a set of relationships that Express Scripts and Evernorth will continue to manage from a relationship and account management perspective, and we'll continue to be very involved in an area of focus for us. So overall, I'm very excited about the opportunity to continue to grow with another partner here. Hi Erin, its Eric. First of all, just would not fundamentally, we start with the portfolio and approach that's equipped to offer a choice and - flexibility in how we work to support our clients. And so, that's the lens I ground back to. We're always open to looking at new ways and approaches and such that drive increased affordability and meets the needs of our buyers. And I'm really proud of the range of different financing solutions we offer and the number of innovations that we've delivered in 2023 and already in 2024 in terms of the types of options that we bring to our clients. And in fact, as David mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we launched our clear network solution, which was its first of its kind. It's comprehensive and simple solution to providing a cost index-based pharmacy network. A solution is unique in that it provides access to all the drugs in pricing that's based off of independent externally created cost on disease, kind of a simple margin that's shared between us and the dispensing pharmacy. So use that as an example. We had a lot of good conversations about that as a program and as an offering, but would note that the selling seasons for these types of things tend to be long in time. It's a long lead time in terms of implementation of such. So, some good conversations with our clients on solutions like that. Looking at other changes in the ecosystem, overall, with note, our clients are demanding more for their healthcare dollars. And are looking for ways to improve affordability overall and broadly are not interested in paying more for the same services that they received today. We've got a wide variety of networks and solutions that exist already in the market and the flexibility to adapt and adjust the configuration of our networks to trade-off costs relative to the value and access profiles that exist. So overall, we've got good flexibility, good capabilities and modularity to be able to approach and line up our capabilities best with what our clients need. Great. Thanks, Brian. So with Centene, first, I would just start by actually noting how proud I am of how our team has delivered here and how we worked collaboratively across and with the Centene team. It's really been a great effort and one that's come together really nicely for the benefit of our now shared customers. implementation has gone really well, and the first month has been quite successful. Now consistent with what we've said before, and as Brian just noted, in 2023, we had meaningful implementation spending and no associated revenue generated a loss 2024. We have results that will be approximately breakeven in 2025. We expect to achieve our run rate margin for this contract, which will be lower than the overall of the business. With respect to the year 2024 timing that Brian alluded to before, you should just think about this, there's a lot more activity that has to happen at the beginning of a contract like this. There's more client outreach. There's work to get individuals into their therapies, et cetera. So there's normal effect here of just additional work and activity that has to take place in the first part of the year, and our expenses will reflect that. So that's a bit of that in-year shaping. But it's all consistent with what we had shared before. The final thing I'd note is consistent with our kind of normal practice now that Centene is a live client of ours won't be commenting going forward on specific profitability of a specific client or things along those lines, but know that the trajectory here is off to the same start we expected and consistent with what we had talked about previously."

We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. . In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A.  As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP.  A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance.  In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC.  Before turning over the call, I will cover a few items pertaining to our financial results. In the third quarter, we recorded an after-tax special item charge of $171 million or $0.58 per share for charges primarily associated with our Medicare litigation settlement.  We also recorded an after-tax special item charge of $19 million or $0.06 per share associated with the sale of our international life accidental and supplemental business to Chubb and an after-tax special item charge of $9 million or $0.03 per share for integration and transaction-related costs.  As described in today's release, special items are excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues in our discussion of financial results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends.  With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We had another quarter of strong performance, and we remain on pace for a year of sustained momentum in 2023.  With the strength of capabilities across our health services and benefits platforms, we are continuing to deliver on our mission for those we serve as we continue to grow our company.  Today, I'll highlight key drivers supporting our performance during the quarter our priorities and opportunities for expanding our impact and continue to advance our growth and our view of 2024, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds.  Brian will share additional perspective about our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. So with that, let's get started.  In the third quarter, we delivered $49 billion in total revenue, adjusted earnings per share of $6.77, continued strong cash flow generation across our franchise, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation. These results are strong, and they show how we're continuing our track record of strong, sustained performance.  With our Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare Benefits platform, we are executing well in a dynamic period and fueling customer growth with our deep clinical expertise, innovative solutions and breadth of market-leading capabilities.  Our results during the quarter demonstrate how we're continuing to deliver on our commitments for our customers and patients our clients as well as our shareholders. We are raising our full year 2023 outlook for EPS, customer and revenue growth, as well as cash flow from operations.  With our continued affordability initiatives, we are also now guiding to an improved medical care ratio for 2023. Our businesses are performing well, and we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.75 for full year 2023.  Now I'll turn to how we are working to sustain our growth and impact. With our durable strategic growth framework, we harness complementary capabilities from across the Cigna Group. We have scale to mature businesses that drive foundational growth, and businesses in faster-growing market segments that contribute accelerated growth.  We fuel additional growth through cross enterprise leverage as we bring together the power of our talent, client relationships, differentiated capabilities and innovation from across our company.  Next, I'll share how we have deliberately shaped our portfolio of businesses that are well positioned for today's market needs. Additionally, I'll highlight some of the ways we continue to drive our sustained success as we look to the future.  Evernorth Health Services continues to demonstrate a proven ability to create value with differentiated pharmacy care and benefits capabilities. We had a strong pharmacy benefit selling season for 2024, and our teams are already actively engaged in the 2025 season. We are continuing to innovate and provide our clients with expanded choice as well as market-leading value.  Many of the clients we serve leverage Evernorth's unique suite of solutions to support the needs of their customers. Centene is one new relationship we discussed before, and our teams have been collaborating effectively on implementation work, which is going very well as we prepare to serve approximately 20 million Centene customers beginning in January.  We have a leadership position in addressing a substantial market opportunity with the expanded wave of pharmacological innovation that is reshaping the health care landscape. Many of the treatments that are coming to market are pressuring affordability with high list prices from drug manufacturers.  At Evernorth, we are driving better experience, clinical outcome and affordability for patients and clients, given our deep clinical expertise, strong relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as with physicians.  The surge of demand for the GLP-1 drug class for weight management offers a good example of how we provide value. Our InCircle Rx program is an innovative solution that addresses the complexity and costs associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a prevalent combination of conditions that's also known as cardio diabesity. Growing at Evernorth's clinical expertise, breadth and depth of data and analytical insights, InCircle Rx guides patients to the most effective care and helps improve affordability for clients.  Beyond the GLP-1 drug class, we expect to see many different manufacturers bringing forth a growing number of new drugs, including gene therapies, additional treatments for cancer as well as others for Alzheimer's and other conditions.  We are uniquely well positioned to make medicine more accessible, affordable and clinically coordinated for those we serve as well as to continue to drive growth for our company.  Now in our international health business, another foundational business within a portfolio. We are supporting continued growth in target markets and expanding our portfolio of solutions. During the quarter, for example, we introduced a new affordable health plan, customized specifically for the globally mobile seniors population.  Additionally, in the foundational portfolio, our U.S. commercial business continues to harness cross-enterprise leverage capabilities for the benefit of their clients.  As we look forward to 2024, we know that additional -- in addition to affordability, one of the top priorities for many employers is expanding access, coordination and overall effectiveness of behavioral health programs and solutions.  The benefit of our commercial clients to customers, we are leveraging innovations and capabilities that exist in our accelerated businesses. For example, stress, anxiety, [indiscernible], other mental health conditions create challenges for employers who need a healthy, engaged workforce, and we continue to expand the behavioral health solutions we offer through Evernorth Care businesses.  One of the newer solutions is Confide behavioral health navigator. It's resonating well with clients, helping us both retain and win new business. Confide is guided by a proven model of a more proactive, high-touch service level, effective monitoring and targeted follow-up engagement.  We will launch additional enhancements next year to provide digital tools that are personalized to the needs of individual patients that improve matching them with the right therapists and also offer greater convenience and accelerated scheduling opportunities.  Additionally, as we continue to advance our focus on vitality, including our latest research addressing the capacity of individuals across multiple dimensions, it reinforces that mental health, for example, is one of the most significant drivers. We know that adults without significant mental health challenges are 10x more likely to have high vitality. Now if you're an employer, this means higher engagement, higher productivity, lower turnover as well as lower medical costs.  In addition to addressing growing behavior health needs in Evernorth Care, we are also acting as a positive disruptor in care delivery and care management to improve experience, outcomes and access from a patient's perspective. We're developing innovative care models and clinical programs with continued investments, for example, to expand our digital and virtually-led capabilities, while making sure they are coordinated and connected with physical sites of care. For example, we continue to innovate and build on leading virtual care platform and plan to further accelerate new capabilities in 2024.  Turning to another accelerated growth business. I'll touch on specialty pharmacy. Last quarter, we talked with you about Accredo's extensive clinical expertise in the assets that provide us with a competitive advantage in this fast-growing specialty pharmacy market, which continues to be an important source of growth for our company.  We also have additional capabilities contributing to our leadership and growth opportunities in this space. Accredo focuses predominantly on supporting patients who receive specialty drugs in their home. Sometimes, these complex medications also need to be administered in physician's offices or hospital outpatient settings.  Today, we support providers and health systems with our CuraScript specialty distribution capability and we continue to see meaningful growth in this aspect of our specialty pharmacy services.  Finally, an additional accelerated business is our U.S. government portfolio services. We are pleased with our recent Medicare stars quality rating showing that we again have over 2/3 of our members in 4-star or higher plans. This is recognition of the value we provide to seniors in supporting access as well as high-quality care.  With open enrollment now underway for both Medicare Advantage and the individual exchange business, we are balancing competitive benefit offerings, targeted market expansion and pricing discipline activity.  So to summarize, we are performing well across our diverse enterprise. And these highlights reinforce how our strategic framework guides us in accelerating innovation, expanding client relationships and continuing to broaden our reach.  Now as we look to 2024, we expect another strong year of performance for the Cigna Group as we build on momentum with EPS, revenue and cash flow growth. We'll share more detailed guidance with you on our fourth quarter earnings call as we always do.  The tailwinds and headwinds we expect in the year ahead remain largely consistent with our prior conversation, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 per share in 2024.  Notable tailwinds include growth-related contributions, including the full launch of Centene, which starts on January 1, a growing positive impact of biosimilar contributions, and an improved margin profile in our individual exchange business.  In terms of headwinds, we will continue to make strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation as well as position ourselves for long-term growth.  Now I'll just briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. We had another strong quarter, and it builds on good momentum throughout the course of the year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.77, as well as strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth.  Our company continues to deliver for the benefit of those we serve, and we have been able to increase our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, and we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024, which is consistent with our past discussions.  We are well positioned with a clear durable strategic framework that leverages the power of our differentiated services within our benefits portfolio and services portfolio.  And now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian?\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's third quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.  We are proud to deliver another strong quarterly performance, including all of our most critical metrics running in line or favorable to expectations. With this performance, we are increasing our full year adjusted 2023 earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  Now looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 8% to $49 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growth of 8% to $2 billion, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to $6.77, and cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion.  Our 2 growth platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting a bottom line growth rate that improved sequentially as expected, and Cigna Healthcare delivering results ahead of expectations.  Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, with third quarter 2023 revenues growing 8% to $38.6 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings growing 6% to $1.7 billion in line with expectations.  Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong performance in our Specialty Pharmacy business, which continues to see double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.  We continue to provide a variety of differentiated services and solutions that drive affordability and value for our customers and our clients, while also enhancing cross enterprise leverage across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare growth platforms.  In addition, we continue to make strategic investments to support onboarding of new clients and expansion of existing client relationships, all while advancing our digital and care solutions capabilities to enhance customer experiences and provide clients with greater options to achieve their critical goals of access, quality outcomes and affordability.  Overall, Evernorth delivered strong third quarter results, consistent with expectations, and we remain well positioned as we look to the remainder of the year.  Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Third quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $12.8 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings grew 16% to $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.5%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations, driven by our U.S. commercial business. More specifically, our favorable MCR performance was a reflection of ongoing disciplined pricing and continued affordability initiatives, ensuring patients get quality care in appropriate settings. An example of this is Pathwell Specialty, our site of care program that aligns patients who have high-cost specialty conditions with high quality, yet cost-effective care settings.  Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.6 million total medical customers, which represents growth of approximately 1.6 million customers year-to-date. On a sequential basis, we delivered medical customer growth across all businesses within Cigna Healthcare, ahead of expectations.  Overall, Cigna Healthcare continues to provide differentiated value and drive affordability for our customers and clients, and the results in the quarter demonstrate our strong underlying fundamentals.  Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $192 billion, driven by strong growth across our businesses. And we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. This implies mid- to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior commentary.  In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.6 million customers. This updated outlook represents the third consecutive quarter we have increased our customer growth despite the dynamic economic backdrop. We now expect our medical care ratio to be within a range of 81.5% to 82%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the high end of the prior range. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. This outlook reflects our continued focus and execution across our Cigna Healthcare businesses.  Additionally, our full year 2023 enterprise adjusted SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.4%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms.  And finally, our full year 2023 adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%.  Turning to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 1, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.2 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $1 billion to at least $10.5 billion for full year 2023. And our updated guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares outstanding to now be in the range of 296 million to 298 million shares.  Our healthy balance sheet and cash flow outlook benefit from our efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  Now to recap. Third quarter results were strong, reflecting execution across our diverse portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.75. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter call, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.  That said, I'd like to expand upon the tailwinds and headwinds David spoke to earlier. Our tailwinds include revenue growth, inclusive of the full launch of our Centene relationship starting January 1, and continued momentum of the biosimilar opportunity to drive more savings to benefit our patients and clients.  We also anticipate improvement in our individual exchange margins next year driven by our pricing actions taken in targeted geographies. Given these actions, we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business relative to where we are in 2023.  These tailwinds will be partially offset by continued strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation and long-term growth.  We look forward to providing detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill: I just really wanted to focus on a couple of things. One would be potential PBM legislation as we think about potentially an end of year bill.  What are your thoughts on what could be included on the PBM side?  And then secondly, David, you talked about InCircle Rx and talked about GLP-1. I think this is a real benefit, especially when I think about your PBM business for the self-insured market.  Can you maybe just talk about the opportunities that you see there? And how you see that going forward? Are we seeing more people sign up for this in '24, et cetera?\nDavid Cordani: It's David. I'll take the legislative question, a little tee up relative to the GLP-1 question in the broader marketplace, and I'll ask Eric to expand on the InCircle Rx program. Specific to legislation, as you know, we haven't continued to expect to operate in a very active regulatory and legislative environment. As a result, we remain active and constructively engaged in the ongoing dialogue. And by way of framing, before I get the specific, potential legislative activities, we positioned our company with a breadth of capabilities, both modular configured and otherwise, and value creation and value capture capabilities that we believe will be able to thrive and grow under a variety of environments.  I'd highlight an area where we have a lot of passion, and that is to ensure that and amplify the fact that any legislative regulatory activity should not remove choice, especially from the commercial market for employers as well as health plans given that they are large sophisticated organizations and fund the vast majority of the comprehensive benefit costs.  Having said that, there is intensified activity around transparency, and we are highly supportive of transparency so long it is targeted and constructive, meaning it could drive requisite level of actions on a go-forward basis.  As it relates to the innovation that's taking place, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned. We took very deliberate actions 5 years ago by acquiring Express Scripts, 3 years ago by launching Evernorth, our continued ongoing investment in our specialty capabilities, et cetera, are all oriented around positioning toward both today's class of drugs that we're seeing like the GLP-1s, but future innovations, be they for Alzheimer's, additional cancer therapies, gene therapies, et cetera. And we believe we're well positioned to support both commercial clients as well as health plans.  InCircle Rx is a wonderful new innovation. It's the first of its kind in the marketplace and highly supportive of clients.  Eric, can I ask you to expand on that?\nEric Palmer: Sure, David. Lisa, It's Eric. As you can imagine, there is significant interest and need from our clients on the InCircle Rx program and helping them with GLP-1s more broadly. They're looking for our help with managing the affordability and ensuring that they get good outcomes from the spending on these treatments.  As David teed up, I'm really excited about, and I think the InCircle Rx program is a great example of the power of the collective capabilities that we have within Evernorth. It's the first of its kind, comprehensive solution that brings together our supply chain and procurement expertise, along with our clinical capabilities to target the right patient population, the relevant clinical markers, it targets the pharmacy network management, working to eliminate any waste or use in the system, and it works to engage patients with additional support that they need to help make changes that makes the impact last year. And we wrap this all with a guarantee of clinical outcomes and such for our clients as well.  So we're -- in short, we're really optimistic and excited about the opportunity for this product brings to self-funded markets and would expect additional growth as we look into 2024 and beyond.\nOperator: And this question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake: I wanted to focus on the individual market for a second. Membership was up pretty significantly there, almost 100,000 members. Curious if that's what's driving your 200,000 member guidance increase? You're expecting another big slug of those members in the fourth quarter. . And then can you remind us where you are on margins relative to target this year, and where you kind of -- you talked about improving that? Do you expect to get into target margins next year? That would be helpful.\nBrian Evanko: Justin, it's Brian. Just to clarify, your second question was specifically on the individual exchanges, correct, in terms of the margin profile?\nJustin Lake: Exactly.\nBrian Evanko: Yes. Yes. So first off, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare customer guide increasing by 200,000 customers, I'd start by saying we're really pleased with the strong momentum across the health care book with our year-to-date customers running ahead of expectations. And that builds off a really strong year we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers in the Cigna Healthcare business, primarily in our U.S. commercial business.  To your point, we have continued to show sequential growth in our U.S. government businesses in the third quarter, particularly individual exchanges. But we've also seen favorability in our U.S. commercial membership, as we have not seen the disenrollment levels we had incorporated into our prior outlook.  You may recall that we had been anticipating some economic weakness late in 2023, but this has not yet materialized in any notable impact on our customer volumes. So all in, we're really pleased with 9% projected full year customer growth in Cigna Healthcare, a portion of which is related to the individual exchanges, but a portion of which is related to the strength in our U.S. commercial business.  As it relates to the individual exchange margin profile, just for a little bit of context, you can think of this as being approximately a $5 billion block of business for us in 2023. And as we shared in our second quarter call, we anticipate the individual exchange book to run below our target margins in 2023, and our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%.  A primary driver of this is the increased risk adjustment payable that we expect to owe, with the majority of that impact driven by our 2 largest states, notably Texas and Georgia.  Now for 2024, we've taken sizable price increases in both of these 2 large states, and we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual book overall. The exact amount of the margin improvement will be a function of our geographic mix and our duration mix in 2024, and we're likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange products in 2024 compared to where we are in 2023. But hopefully, that helps a bit, as you think about how to model the '24 Cigna Healthcare outlook.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. In the tailwind side of things. You talked about revenue growth, including the Centene launch. You've talked so far about the exchanges as well as kind of other kind of one-time items.  Does that mean that we should generally think about the rest of the businesses growing more or less in line with those long-term growth targets? Or is there any other business where you would highlight a specific headwind or tailwind to the revenue growth outlook for next year?\nDavid Cordani: Kevin, it's David. I'd ask you to step back and first look at the consistency of our performance over the years relative to the portfolio. And if you look at the -- our EPS CAGR, even over the past several years, with a slight downtick this year because of the investments we've made to onboard Centene and our outlook for 2024, we remain consistently within our growth algorithm of 10% to 13% on average EPS CAGR as we've delivered that over the last 3 years, 5 years and 10-year time horizon.  We called out a few of the headwinds and tailwinds to try to amplify some of the components. I would suggest that the first component, the outsized growth, and specifically the Centene contribution, given the offset in 2023, you can view that one as more directionally additive. That pushes us to the high end of the range from an EPS growth standpoint versus the low end of the range.  The other items that we've talked about are largely contemplated in the core parts of our business and the core parts of our operations on a go-forward basis. And as Brian and I both noted, we'll give you more detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call, as we typically do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from AJ Rice with UBS.\nA.J. Rice: Just to maybe continue to focus on some of those potential tailwinds for next year. I think the investment to get that large Centene contract up and running for this year was about $0.50 drag roughly $200 million pretax.  When you think about that for next year, should we just assume that, that drag goes away? I know PBM contracts typically ramp up over time. Or is there some potential level of profit contribution, so the swing is greater than $0.50?  And then on the biosimilar comment. I know this year, in the second half, you'd included some benefit from the HUMIRA conversion or having some biosimilar competition. Should we think of -- what you're thinking about as a tailwind of just annualizing that? Or are there other opportunities that go beyond just annualizing the second half benefit from that HUMIRA conversion?\nDavid Cordani: AJ, it's David. You've packed a lot in there. I'm going to ask Brian to start by framing the economics year-over-year on the Centene relationship, our investment, the year-over-year performance, et cetera.  Asking to transition that over to Eric, he could talk about how the relationship is going importantly. And I'll ask Eric to amplify a little bit relative to the biosimilar impact we're seeing in the latter part of this year and into next year. Brian?\nBrian Evanko: As it relates to the Centene economics, your math is broadly right. We continue to expect to spend about $200 million this year in the process of preparing for the onboarding.  We expect next year to be approximately breakeven or slightly positive. So that's the way to think about the modeling of that, '25, we continue to expect, it will be at run rate profitability.  As it relates to the biosimilars component, for '24, we expect it to largely be a HUMIRA driven biosimilar story. So that the '25, and thereafter biosimilars will be further accretive to Evernorth in time, but '24 is really going to be primarily driven by the annualization of the HUMIRA related biosimilar benefit.  Eric, do you want to pick up?\nEric Palmer: Sure. we've said from the beginning that the adoption of biosimilars is going to be more extended and slower process. And the experience to date has been consistent with our expectations. We've driven meaningful savings for the benefit of our customers and clients so far this year, and we continue to see this opportunity ramp throughout the course of next year, and as part of the market ongoing.  We've talked in other settings about the meaningful opportunity for biosimilars, not only for [indiscernible] but for other conditions, and expect there to be more competition over time where up to 25% or 30% of the spend in the specialty market, we'll have competition, compared to something like less than 10% today.  So in short, this is an area that we're well positioned to drive meaningful value for the benefit of our customers and clients that we have seen unfolding consistent with our expectations. And we're positioned to lead through over the course of the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter: I was hoping you could expand a little bit on the MLR outperformance in the quarter. I guess, could you talk a bit more about what you saw on utilization? I guess, how did the seasonal patterns and the third quarter compared to a more normal pre-COVID environment?  And then, it looks like you assumed a decent step-up in Q4, pretty consistent with what you've seen in the past couple of years. Can you talk a little bit about the assumptions there on utilization?\nBrian Evanko: It's Brian. So I'll start again, just reiterating how pleased we are to have delivered another strong quarter of MCR performance in Cigna Healthcare, which was favorable to expectations and drove really the income outperformance that we saw in the Cigna Healthcare segment.  Just as a reminder, if you rewind the clock a bit here, we planned in price for more normalized utilization levels coming into 2023. And our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation.  Now within the quarter specifically, our government product lines, you can think of the Medicare lines and individual exchange lines ran largely in line with expectations, while our U.S. commercial business drove the favorability in the medical care ratio.  As it relates to the full year MCR outlook, we have improved the expectation by 15 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting the favorable third quarter experience, but no significant change in our fourth quarter MCR outlook compared to our prior expectations. So that's the way I'd encourage you to think about the 3Q versus 4Q dynamics.  As it relates to specific utilization patterns and categories and such, I actually wouldn't call out any specific categories in terms of driving outsized favorability. We did see some modest amount of inpatient favorability in the third quarter, particularly on higher unit cost procedures, which did contribute to that MCR outperformance.  But I'd also note that our site of care strategies continue to produce really strong results. A tangible example we often talk about is shifting inpatient procedures to outpatient, for example, on orthopedics. But the site of care strategies have advanced in many other areas as well. For example, Pathwell Specialty, which I talked about earlier, program we introduced that optimizes CytoCare for high-cost infusions of specialty drugs. Historically, these have been administered in the hospital outpatient setting. However, certain patients can experience equal or better clinical quality at a lower cost by having the infusion in their home.  So that's just an example of something that has continued to build over time and contributed to the favorable MCR performance we saw in the quarter.  So just to summarize, we're pleased with the performance, U.S. commercial drove the majority of the favorability in the third quarter. And as noted, the fourth quarter MCL is very consistent with our prior expectations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJoshua Raskin: I didn't hear in the prepared remarks anything about commercial, large group membership to start the year. So I'm curious on that. But my real question is, if you could compare and contrast the traction you're getting around VillageMD in the commercial markets versus the Medicare markets, I'd be specifically interested in the appetite from large employers. And if there's any sort of pull for demand? Or are you getting more traction when you're presenting what those arrangements can look like?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, it's David. Let me speak to the commercial large market, and then frame your specific question relative to early traction with Village. And then I'm going to ask Eric to just describe a little bit more broadly the evolving relationship and the strategic work we continue to advance with Village.  First, specific to the commercial marketplace and the selling season. You did miss it, we didn't profile the 2024 outlook in any level of detail.  Stepping back, as Brian noted in his prior comment, we're really pleased with the 2023 results, now increasing the outlook for our overall lives for our Cigna Healthcare care portfolio, yet again, in excess of 1 million half lives, and coming off of a 2022 number, approaching 1 million lives.  For 2024, I give you some directional indicators at this point in time. First, big picture for the enterprise. We expect it to be another attractive year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, specific to the commercial marketplace, we expect within the commercial marketplace portfolio, our results continue to be led by our sustained strong performance. The combination of our select segment and our middle market segment where our value proposition and our products and services are resonating quite well. Strong retention and good new business adds within that portfolio.  And then specific to National Accounts. Currently, our outlook for 2024 is on the benefit side of the equation, after some outsized growth in 2023, 2024 will look a little bit more normalized relative to prior years. And to remind you, strategically for that segment, we've expected to see that segment be a flat to slightly shrinking segment in the market in aggregate within the employer landscape. Our strategy has us maintaining share and deepening our relationship with our clients through our further expanding portfolio of specialty services.  So to put a circle around it, it will be another strong year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, and the commercial portfolio in 2024 will be led by the sustained strength of the select and the middle market business.  Specific to Villages, a quick tee up to your comment. Our commercial employers today already are seeing a step function to benefit from our relationship with Village and then the Village Summit acquisition in the nature in which we've structured that relationship. So we were able to deliver a step function of value to our commercial clients already, be they self-funded, be they shared returns, be they guarantee cost from that standpoint.  And then the team is aggressively at work to further enhance the value proposition there.  And Eric, I'll just ask you to provide a little color in terms of the way in which the teams are working together to advance the value-based care traction.\nEric Palmer: Sure. Stepping back a bit for Village, have you think about both the financial and the strategic component of our relationship with Village, as you know, we got a minority stake of ownership now. And so that's performing consistent with our expectations.  From a strategic perspective, think of our work with Village is one Village and us being committed partners to work together. We're working to build an alignment of an ecosystem of high-performing providers where we can ramp Village and Summit's operations with some of our clinical assets, raft and support with the data and insights from both organizations to help to ensure patients can get to the best care they need, the best specialists they need, the highest quality, et cetera.  And I really think of that as ultimately applicable across commercial or government plans. Our focus in the near term has been, I'll say, more skewed towards the commercial market, but it's an approach that works across any payer here, right, because it focuses on getting to the highest quality, best care available for an individual. And that transcends across all the markets.  Over time, we'll work to continue to expand this. But to date, off to a good start and pleased with the progress and the momentum that we're building with our partnership with Village.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel: I was hoping maybe we could just toggle over to MA for a second, and maybe just give us sort of a framing of uppers on how sort of MLR was performing, and pretax margin sort of baseline versus the long-term government 3% to 5% target for '23?  And then, if you want to give us some initial observations on how the AEP seems to be developing for you, and how you feel about MA growth next year versus, let's call it, the industry forecast around 7% growth.\nDavid Cordani: Scott, it's David. Just a couple of comments, and I'll ask Brian to peel back a couple of your specific points.  First, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're pleased with the Stars position, the stable, strong Stars position we have, and continued traction of our ongoing focus to expand our geographic footprint. And then I'll ask Brian to expand on a little bit more significantly, as well as our ongoing investments in terms of our broad set of capabilities.  2023 was a very good year of growth for us in terms of this business portfolio, and our market expansion plans are on track for 2024. Brian, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit?\nBrian Evanko: Sure, David. Scott, maybe I'll take your questions in a little bit of a reverse order, and start with AEP and the growth expectations, then I'll get to the margin profile.  As David just referenced, we're really pleased with the growth in the MA book year-to-date. Customers are up 13% year-to-date 2023. And since 2019, as you know, we've gradually expanded our geographic footprint in this business, from covering just 20% of Medicare Advantage eligibles in 2019 to over 40% today. And for 2024, we have some further expansion transpiring, and we'll now have offerings in about 45% of the addressable market.  As we approach the 2024 bid cycle, we employed a micro market posture as we always do, and this resulted in stable benefits in most geographies and a few areas where we had targeted pullbacks and benefits in light of the funding environment.  Now it's really early in the AEP, as you can appreciate, and there's still several weeks to go. But taken all together, based on what we know today, we would expect to see net customer growth again in 2024.  As it relates to the margin profile, as we expected, our 2023 margins continue to be below our long-term target margin range, which is 4% to 5% on this book of business. You can think of this as primarily driven by administrative expenses as we have outsized investment spend and geographic expansion, product expansion and new capabilities.  So you should think of the MA margins as representing a source of future embedded earnings power that will contribute toward our long-term growth in Cigna Healthcare segment income over a multiyear basis.  For 2024, we expect to continue running below our long-term target margin range in this business. The final projected margin here will also be a function of geographic mix, product mix and customer duration mix, depending on how that shakes out in the AEP and across the balance of the year.  So we'll certainly be prepared to give you more detailed guidance during the fourth quarter call, but hopefully, that helps turn out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with Cowen.\nGary Taylor: I just wanted to go back and ask one more question about the exchange business and expectations for next year.  When we look at the pricing actions you guys took about across markets, it looks very, very outsized versus what the rest of the industry did. So I think that's it's a huge positive in terms of the margin expectation.  But historically, companies that have done that have seen really significant deterioration of enrollment.  So I guess the question is, how much of the at least $28 in 2024 is dependent upon exchange earnings? If we saw the enrollment decline by 30%, 40%, something like that, yet the margin was better, is that impactful to getting to the 24% guidance? Like how much should we care about where we see the enrollment numbers come in?\nBrian Evanko: Gary, it's Brian. So certainly, your point is well taken in terms of large price increases can have impacts on the customer volumes in disproportionate ways. We have to see how this cycle plays out in terms of the elasticity of the customer growth relative to those pricing actions.  To David's comments earlier on our tailwinds, this is one of several tailwinds that we have. So I would encourage you not to over-index on the customer volumes in terms of our ability to deliver against the $28 of earnings per share.  Just if you think about the context of this, it's a $5 billion block of business. Target margins, that's $250 million of profit. The midpoint of the 4% to 6% range. So if you think about the delta there, relative to the year-over-year, we're talking about $100 millions of income growth at the enterprise level.  So I just -- I would encourage you not to overindex on this one specific factor. But we're confident we're going to see the margin expansion. We're confident we'll see the income tailwind, and we'll give you more updated guidance on the fourth quarter call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: I wanted to follow up on the comments around GLP-1 through obesity, and the potential value of Evernorth can deliver for clients there.  I guess, could you go into a little bit more detail on the nature of discussions you're having with the drug manufacturers right now on pricing and getting that to a level that could expand access?  And what role, maybe, the outcomes trials will play in those discussions in terms of potentially -- from your kind of commercial customers, their desire to expand access to these therapies for their populations?\nDavid Cordani: It's David. Just a little framing. And consistent with prior conversations we've had. To date, within our benefits portfolio, you could think about 10% to 20% of our clients currently having adopted an optional buy-up or coverage for weight management outside of the already formulary positioning for diabetes for the drug class, number one. On the Evernorth side of the equation, as we've discussed before, the percentage is higher, and you can think about why the difference. The difference is within the Evernorth portfolio, the commercial employer landscape is larger employer size on average versus the diversity that exists on the Cigna Healthcare care side. And then within the health plan portfolio, enabling some aspect of it from an access. So that gives you little stage setting of the fluidity of the current environment.  Your question comes down to a fair amount of detail relative to pricing and working with the manufacturers. I'll ask Eric to talk just more broadly, this is an area where, as we discussed in our prepared remarks, where the broad capabilities of our Evernorth portfolio significantly thrive in terms of data clinical aspects, clinical coordination, relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and importantly, relationship with practicing physicians to get the best coordinated care.  So Eric, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit?\nEric Palmer: Great. So with respect to this, Stepping back, I would have you think about the impact here that will need to unfold, will be around improving affordability. As has been said and reported across a variety of different channels, these therapies are effective, but they're also very expensive. We would expect that over time, we'll be well positioned to harness the power of competition to improve the affordability to bring the cost down. That's an important element.  But then in addition to that, we're positioned to wrap and support these patients with additional services, clinical services, the right approach, the right targeting to ensure the maximum effectiveness here.  So I don't know that it's constructive to talk about any of the kind of ongoing dialogue with manufacturers. But rest assured, that we are very engaged with the variety of pharma manufacturers in this space, looking at ways to expand access and improve affordability, just like Express Scripts is a long history of doing, as new innovations have come to the market and the pharmacy space, and we'll continue to be a leader there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley: Mostly a clarification. On the government utilization, maybe particularly Medicare Advantage, it sounds like it was in line with your expectations. But I wondered if you could comment if you are seeing elevated -- in the elevated outpatient that gets called out by others in the space, and that was just, again, in line with your expectations.  And then in terms of managing utilization inside of service. You mentioned good success in managing side of service and Pathwell. Is Pathwell the primary vehicle by which you're doing that? And what is the kind of customer adoption or the penetration, I guess, of Pathwell in your side of surface utilization management?\nBrian Evanko: Dave, it's Brian. So on your first question on the MA utilization patterns, as I mentioned earlier, when we stepped into 2023, we expected more normalized utilization levels across all of our different product lines, and the claims experience is broadly in line with that.  And within the MA book specifically, throughout the entire year, we've seen elevated utilization in both outpatient and professional services in particular. But again, within the context of what we had forecasted and planned for. So the third quarter, our government lines ran broadly in line with where we expected them to. And as I said earlier, our U.S. commercial business really drove the favorability.  So again, the MA patterns were broadly a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year, and our 2023 guidance and 2024 bids anticipate that these dynamics will continue as opposed to assuming any meaningful amount of cost abatement occurs.  On your second question on site of service, I did call out the Pathwell specialty example. But you should think of that as one of the many arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will. So the work we've been doing over the past several years has largely been moving inpatient to outpatient. We've been moving things from emergency rooms to urgent care, moving things from physician offices to virtual.  So Pathwell Specialty is another example of the evolution of our CytoCare program. So I wouldn't view that as the silver bullet here by any means, but it's an incremental contributor to the strategy we had in place for several years now.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Just wanted to turn to the PBM within Evernorth. And kind of 2 elements to the question. One was, if you could just talk a little about the strategic role of Part D, both for the PBM and for health care for driving kind of MA business going forward? And how you see that going forward, given some of the changes in the Part D program.  And then the specific question was on adjusted home delivery and specialty scripts. There were some drops in that. I was just interested if that was a driver -- that was driven by the prime relationship and any sort of in-sourcing that's going on there? Or what the other drivers of that move was?\nDavid Cordani: Lance, it's David. I'll take the first part of your question. I'll ask Brian to address the second part of your question. . First, specific to Part D broadly, with the size, shape and scope of our enterprise today, it's a portion of our enterprise, but I would call it as not a significant part of our overall portfolio. That's not to dismiss the importance of it from a societal standpoint, by any stretch of imagination. But when you look at the scope of our enterprise approaching $200 billion of revenue this year, I would not call it as a significant component.  Secondly, inferred in your question, I would submit that we've underrealized or underleveraged the potential to effectively convert PDP lives or enroll PDP lives into MA. That's an untapped opportunity that exists within our portfolio today relative to our level of activity and initiation.  Lastly, in your comment, we do recognize that the PDP landscape is disrupted, based on some of the legislative and policy activities that have transpired. And we will effectively position our portfolio, obviously, to be responsive to that disruption. But we have the tools to be able to manage within our portfolio in totality.  I'll ask Brian to pick up the second piece of your question, just relative to the script volume and the puts and takes in the portfolio this past quarter.\nBrian Evanko: Yes, as it relates to the adjusted home delivery and specialty scripts, you can think of a couple of different drivers in there. Specialty scripts continue to grow at attractive rates, so I think mid- to high single-digit-type unit growth. But given the relatively small numbers there, they're outweighed by what happens in home delivery.  So in that line item, you can think of 95% plus of the volume is home delivery, and less than 5% is specialty scripts, but attractive growth in specialty, which continues to drive the double-digit revenue growth that we've seen in that business all year.  The specific driver of the home delivery decrease, just to put a finer point on it, is we had a transitioning client that we've known about for several years, [indiscernible] had some outsized home delivery volumes, but we'll see some improvement in that on a go-forward basis with additional clients coming in.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: First and foremost, thank you again for joining our call today and for the ongoing conversation.  Just to highlight and summarize our dialogue today, we are very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the momentum we've been able to carry now through 3 quarters of the year. And we remain on track to deliver our overall commitments for 2023.  We increased our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, as well as increasing the overall outlook we have for revenue, customer lives and cash flow based on our strong performance. And remain committed to our 2024 EPS objective of at least $28.  I do want to pause for a moment and thank my colleagues around the world. The health care landscape continues to change, with accelerated forces impacting our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners. And our team leads in day in, day out, working to make a positive difference, for those we have the benefit to serve, those we have the benefit to partner with, as well as our orientation around making a positive difference in the communities we work, serve and play in each and every day.  So I want to call out and thank our colleagues that continue to make such a positive difference in the marketplace each and every day.  With that, we look forward to our ongoing conversation and our future dialogues, both in person and investor events as well as our fourth quarter conversation coming up. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's Third Quarter 2023 Results Review.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's third quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year.  We are proud to deliver another strong quarterly performance, including all of our most critical metrics running in line or favorable to expectations. With this performance, we are increasing our full year adjusted 2023 earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  Now looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 8% to $49 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growth of 8% to $2 billion, adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to $6.77, and cash flow from operations of $2.8 billion.  Our 2 growth platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting a bottom line growth rate that improved sequentially as expected, and Cigna Healthcare delivering results ahead of expectations.  Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results, with third quarter 2023 revenues growing 8% to $38.6 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings growing 6% to $1.7 billion in line with expectations.  Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by strong performance in our Specialty Pharmacy business, which continues to see double-digit year-over-year revenue growth.  We continue to provide a variety of differentiated services and solutions that drive affordability and value for our customers and our clients, while also enhancing cross enterprise leverage across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare growth platforms.  In addition, we continue to make strategic investments to support onboarding of new clients and expansion of existing client relationships, all while advancing our digital and care solutions capabilities to enhance customer experiences and provide clients with greater options to achieve their critical goals of access, quality outcomes and affordability.  Overall, Evernorth delivered strong third quarter results, consistent with expectations, and we remain well positioned as we look to the remainder of the year.  Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Third quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 14% to $12.8 billion. Pretax adjusted earnings grew 16% to $1.2 billion, and the medical care ratio was 80.5%. Our medical care ratio was better than expectations, driven by our U.S. commercial business. More specifically, our favorable MCR performance was a reflection of ongoing disciplined pricing and continued affordability initiatives, ensuring patients get quality care in appropriate settings. An example of this is Pathwell Specialty, our site of care program that aligns patients who have high-cost specialty conditions with high quality, yet cost-effective care settings.  Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.6 million total medical customers, which represents growth of approximately 1.6 million customers year-to-date. On a sequential basis, we delivered medical customer growth across all businesses within Cigna Healthcare, ahead of expectations.  Overall, Cigna Healthcare continues to provide differentiated value and drive affordability for our customers and clients, and the results in the quarter demonstrate our strong underlying fundamentals.  Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $192 billion, driven by strong growth across our businesses. And we are increasing our full year 2023 adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.75 per share.  In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. This implies mid- to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior commentary.  In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.6 million customers. This updated outlook represents the third consecutive quarter we have increased our customer growth despite the dynamic economic backdrop. We now expect our medical care ratio to be within a range of 81.5% to 82%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the high end of the prior range. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. This outlook reflects our continued focus and execution across our Cigna Healthcare businesses.  Additionally, our full year 2023 enterprise adjusted SG&A ratio is now expected to be approximately 7.4%, an increase compared to our prior guidance as we further accelerate investments across both our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms.  And finally, our full year 2023 adjusted tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%.  Turning to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through November 1, 2023, we have repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $2.2 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $1 billion to at least $10.5 billion for full year 2023. And our updated guidance assumes full year 2023 weighted average shares outstanding to now be in the range of 296 million to 298 million shares.  Our healthy balance sheet and cash flow outlook benefit from our efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital.  Now to recap. Third quarter results were strong, reflecting execution across our diverse portfolio of businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.75. While we will provide formal 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter call, we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.  That said, I'd like to expand upon the tailwinds and headwinds David spoke to earlier. Our tailwinds include revenue growth, inclusive of the full launch of our Centene relationship starting January 1, and continued momentum of the biosimilar opportunity to drive more savings to benefit our patients and clients.  We also anticipate improvement in our individual exchange margins next year driven by our pricing actions taken in targeted geographies. Given these actions, we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business relative to where we are in 2023.  These tailwinds will be partially offset by continued strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation and long-term growth.  We look forward to providing detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Justin, it's Brian. Just to clarify, your second question was specifically on the individual exchanges, correct, in terms of the margin profile? Yes. Yes. So first off, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare customer guide increasing by 200,000 customers, I'd start by saying we're really pleased with the strong momentum across the health care book with our year-to-date customers running ahead of expectations. And that builds off a really strong year we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers in the Cigna Healthcare business, primarily in our U.S. commercial business.  To your point, we have continued to show sequential growth in our U.S. government businesses in the third quarter, particularly individual exchanges. But we've also seen favorability in our U.S. commercial membership, as we have not seen the disenrollment levels we had incorporated into our prior outlook.  You may recall that we had been anticipating some economic weakness late in 2023, but this has not yet materialized in any notable impact on our customer volumes. So all in, we're really pleased with 9% projected full year customer growth in Cigna Healthcare, a portion of which is related to the individual exchanges, but a portion of which is related to the strength in our U.S. commercial business.  As it relates to the individual exchange margin profile, just for a little bit of context, you can think of this as being approximately a $5 billion block of business for us in 2023. And as we shared in our second quarter call, we anticipate the individual exchange book to run below our target margins in 2023, and our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%.  A primary driver of this is the increased risk adjustment payable that we expect to owe, with the majority of that impact driven by our 2 largest states, notably Texas and Georgia.  Now for 2024, we've taken sizable price increases in both of these 2 large states, and we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual book overall. The exact amount of the margin improvement will be a function of our geographic mix and our duration mix in 2024, and we're likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange products in 2024 compared to where we are in 2023. But hopefully, that helps a bit, as you think about how to model the '24 Cigna Healthcare outlook. As it relates to the Centene economics, your math is broadly right. We continue to expect to spend about $200 million this year in the process of preparing for the onboarding.  We expect next year to be approximately breakeven or slightly positive. So that's the way to think about the modeling of that, '25, we continue to expect, it will be at run rate profitability.  As it relates to the biosimilars component, for '24, we expect it to largely be a HUMIRA driven biosimilar story. So that the '25, and thereafter biosimilars will be further accretive to Evernorth in time, but '24 is really going to be primarily driven by the annualization of the HUMIRA related biosimilar benefit.  Eric, do you want to pick up? It's Brian. So I'll start again, just reiterating how pleased we are to have delivered another strong quarter of MCR performance in Cigna Healthcare, which was favorable to expectations and drove really the income outperformance that we saw in the Cigna Healthcare segment.  Just as a reminder, if you rewind the clock a bit here, we planned in price for more normalized utilization levels coming into 2023. And our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation.  Now within the quarter specifically, our government product lines, you can think of the Medicare lines and individual exchange lines ran largely in line with expectations, while our U.S. commercial business drove the favorability in the medical care ratio.  As it relates to the full year MCR outlook, we have improved the expectation by 15 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting the favorable third quarter experience, but no significant change in our fourth quarter MCR outlook compared to our prior expectations. So that's the way I'd encourage you to think about the 3Q versus 4Q dynamics.  As it relates to specific utilization patterns and categories and such, I actually wouldn't call out any specific categories in terms of driving outsized favorability. We did see some modest amount of inpatient favorability in the third quarter, particularly on higher unit cost procedures, which did contribute to that MCR outperformance.  But I'd also note that our site of care strategies continue to produce really strong results. A tangible example we often talk about is shifting inpatient procedures to outpatient, for example, on orthopedics. But the site of care strategies have advanced in many other areas as well. For example, Pathwell Specialty, which I talked about earlier, program we introduced that optimizes CytoCare for high-cost infusions of specialty drugs. Historically, these have been administered in the hospital outpatient setting. However, certain patients can experience equal or better clinical quality at a lower cost by having the infusion in their home.  So that's just an example of something that has continued to build over time and contributed to the favorable MCR performance we saw in the quarter.  So just to summarize, we're pleased with the performance, U.S. commercial drove the majority of the favorability in the third quarter. And as noted, the fourth quarter MCL is very consistent with our prior expectations. Sure, David. Scott, maybe I'll take your questions in a little bit of a reverse order, and start with AEP and the growth expectations, then I'll get to the margin profile.  As David just referenced, we're really pleased with the growth in the MA book year-to-date. Customers are up 13% year-to-date 2023. And since 2019, as you know, we've gradually expanded our geographic footprint in this business, from covering just 20% of Medicare Advantage eligibles in 2019 to over 40% today. And for 2024, we have some further expansion transpiring, and we'll now have offerings in about 45% of the addressable market.  As we approach the 2024 bid cycle, we employed a micro market posture as we always do, and this resulted in stable benefits in most geographies and a few areas where we had targeted pullbacks and benefits in light of the funding environment.  Now it's really early in the AEP, as you can appreciate, and there's still several weeks to go. But taken all together, based on what we know today, we would expect to see net customer growth again in 2024.  As it relates to the margin profile, as we expected, our 2023 margins continue to be below our long-term target margin range, which is 4% to 5% on this book of business. You can think of this as primarily driven by administrative expenses as we have outsized investment spend and geographic expansion, product expansion and new capabilities.  So you should think of the MA margins as representing a source of future embedded earnings power that will contribute toward our long-term growth in Cigna Healthcare segment income over a multiyear basis.  For 2024, we expect to continue running below our long-term target margin range in this business. The final projected margin here will also be a function of geographic mix, product mix and customer duration mix, depending on how that shakes out in the AEP and across the balance of the year.  So we'll certainly be prepared to give you more detailed guidance during the fourth quarter call, but hopefully, that helps turn out. Gary, it's Brian. So certainly, your point is well taken in terms of large price increases can have impacts on the customer volumes in disproportionate ways. We have to see how this cycle plays out in terms of the elasticity of the customer growth relative to those pricing actions.  To David's comments earlier on our tailwinds, this is one of several tailwinds that we have. So I would encourage you not to over-index on the customer volumes in terms of our ability to deliver against the $28 of earnings per share.  Just if you think about the context of this, it's a $5 billion block of business. Target margins, that's $250 million of profit. The midpoint of the 4% to 6% range. So if you think about the delta there, relative to the year-over-year, we're talking about $100 millions of income growth at the enterprise level.  So I just -- I would encourage you not to overindex on this one specific factor. But we're confident we're going to see the margin expansion. We're confident we'll see the income tailwind, and we'll give you more updated guidance on the fourth quarter call. Dave, it's Brian. So on your first question on the MA utilization patterns, as I mentioned earlier, when we stepped into 2023, we expected more normalized utilization levels across all of our different product lines, and the claims experience is broadly in line with that.  And within the MA book specifically, throughout the entire year, we've seen elevated utilization in both outpatient and professional services in particular. But again, within the context of what we had forecasted and planned for. So the third quarter, our government lines ran broadly in line with where we expected them to. And as I said earlier, our U.S. commercial business really drove the favorability.  So again, the MA patterns were broadly a continuation of what we saw in the first half of the year, and our 2023 guidance and 2024 bids anticipate that these dynamics will continue as opposed to assuming any meaningful amount of cost abatement occurs.  On your second question on site of service, I did call out the Pathwell specialty example. But you should think of that as one of the many arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will. So the work we've been doing over the past several years has largely been moving inpatient to outpatient. We've been moving things from emergency rooms to urgent care, moving things from physician offices to virtual.  So Pathwell Specialty is another example of the evolution of our CytoCare program. So I wouldn't view that as the silver bullet here by any means, but it's an incremental contributor to the strategy we had in place for several years now. Yes, as it relates to the adjusted home delivery and specialty scripts, you can think of a couple of different drivers in there. Specialty scripts continue to grow at attractive rates, so I think mid- to high single-digit-type unit growth. But given the relatively small numbers there, they're outweighed by what happens in home delivery.  So in that line item, you can think of 95% plus of the volume is home delivery, and less than 5% is specialty scripts, but attractive growth in specialty, which continues to drive the double-digit revenue growth that we've seen in that business all year.  The specific driver of the home delivery decrease, just to put a finer point on it, is we had a transitioning client that we've known about for several years, [indiscernible] had some outsized home delivery volumes, but we'll see some improvement in that on a go-forward basis with additional clients coming in."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. We had another quarter of strong performance, and we remain on pace for a year of sustained momentum in 2023.  With the strength of capabilities across our health services and benefits platforms, we are continuing to deliver on our mission for those we serve as we continue to grow our company.  Today, I'll highlight key drivers supporting our performance during the quarter our priorities and opportunities for expanding our impact and continue to advance our growth and our view of 2024, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds.  Brian will share additional perspective about our third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. So with that, let's get started.  In the third quarter, we delivered $49 billion in total revenue, adjusted earnings per share of $6.77, continued strong cash flow generation across our franchise, all while continuing to reinvest back in our business to fund growth, expansion and ongoing innovation. These results are strong, and they show how we're continuing our track record of strong, sustained performance.  With our Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare Benefits platform, we are executing well in a dynamic period and fueling customer growth with our deep clinical expertise, innovative solutions and breadth of market-leading capabilities.  Our results during the quarter demonstrate how we're continuing to deliver on our commitments for our customers and patients our clients as well as our shareholders. We are raising our full year 2023 outlook for EPS, customer and revenue growth, as well as cash flow from operations.  With our continued affordability initiatives, we are also now guiding to an improved medical care ratio for 2023. Our businesses are performing well, and we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of at least $24.75 for full year 2023.  Now I'll turn to how we are working to sustain our growth and impact. With our durable strategic growth framework, we harness complementary capabilities from across the Cigna Group. We have scale to mature businesses that drive foundational growth, and businesses in faster-growing market segments that contribute accelerated growth.  We fuel additional growth through cross enterprise leverage as we bring together the power of our talent, client relationships, differentiated capabilities and innovation from across our company.  Next, I'll share how we have deliberately shaped our portfolio of businesses that are well positioned for today's market needs. Additionally, I'll highlight some of the ways we continue to drive our sustained success as we look to the future.  Evernorth Health Services continues to demonstrate a proven ability to create value with differentiated pharmacy care and benefits capabilities. We had a strong pharmacy benefit selling season for 2024, and our teams are already actively engaged in the 2025 season. We are continuing to innovate and provide our clients with expanded choice as well as market-leading value.  Many of the clients we serve leverage Evernorth's unique suite of solutions to support the needs of their customers. Centene is one new relationship we discussed before, and our teams have been collaborating effectively on implementation work, which is going very well as we prepare to serve approximately 20 million Centene customers beginning in January.  We have a leadership position in addressing a substantial market opportunity with the expanded wave of pharmacological innovation that is reshaping the health care landscape. Many of the treatments that are coming to market are pressuring affordability with high list prices from drug manufacturers.  At Evernorth, we are driving better experience, clinical outcome and affordability for patients and clients, given our deep clinical expertise, strong relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as with physicians.  The surge of demand for the GLP-1 drug class for weight management offers a good example of how we provide value. Our InCircle Rx program is an innovative solution that addresses the complexity and costs associated with obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, a prevalent combination of conditions that's also known as cardio diabesity. Growing at Evernorth's clinical expertise, breadth and depth of data and analytical insights, InCircle Rx guides patients to the most effective care and helps improve affordability for clients.  Beyond the GLP-1 drug class, we expect to see many different manufacturers bringing forth a growing number of new drugs, including gene therapies, additional treatments for cancer as well as others for Alzheimer's and other conditions.  We are uniquely well positioned to make medicine more accessible, affordable and clinically coordinated for those we serve as well as to continue to drive growth for our company.  Now in our international health business, another foundational business within a portfolio. We are supporting continued growth in target markets and expanding our portfolio of solutions. During the quarter, for example, we introduced a new affordable health plan, customized specifically for the globally mobile seniors population.  Additionally, in the foundational portfolio, our U.S. commercial business continues to harness cross-enterprise leverage capabilities for the benefit of their clients.  As we look forward to 2024, we know that additional -- in addition to affordability, one of the top priorities for many employers is expanding access, coordination and overall effectiveness of behavioral health programs and solutions.  The benefit of our commercial clients to customers, we are leveraging innovations and capabilities that exist in our accelerated businesses. For example, stress, anxiety, [indiscernible], other mental health conditions create challenges for employers who need a healthy, engaged workforce, and we continue to expand the behavioral health solutions we offer through Evernorth Care businesses.  One of the newer solutions is Confide behavioral health navigator. It's resonating well with clients, helping us both retain and win new business. Confide is guided by a proven model of a more proactive, high-touch service level, effective monitoring and targeted follow-up engagement.  We will launch additional enhancements next year to provide digital tools that are personalized to the needs of individual patients that improve matching them with the right therapists and also offer greater convenience and accelerated scheduling opportunities.  Additionally, as we continue to advance our focus on vitality, including our latest research addressing the capacity of individuals across multiple dimensions, it reinforces that mental health, for example, is one of the most significant drivers. We know that adults without significant mental health challenges are 10x more likely to have high vitality. Now if you're an employer, this means higher engagement, higher productivity, lower turnover as well as lower medical costs.  In addition to addressing growing behavior health needs in Evernorth Care, we are also acting as a positive disruptor in care delivery and care management to improve experience, outcomes and access from a patient's perspective. We're developing innovative care models and clinical programs with continued investments, for example, to expand our digital and virtually-led capabilities, while making sure they are coordinated and connected with physical sites of care. For example, we continue to innovate and build on leading virtual care platform and plan to further accelerate new capabilities in 2024.  Turning to another accelerated growth business. I'll touch on specialty pharmacy. Last quarter, we talked with you about Accredo's extensive clinical expertise in the assets that provide us with a competitive advantage in this fast-growing specialty pharmacy market, which continues to be an important source of growth for our company.  We also have additional capabilities contributing to our leadership and growth opportunities in this space. Accredo focuses predominantly on supporting patients who receive specialty drugs in their home. Sometimes, these complex medications also need to be administered in physician's offices or hospital outpatient settings.  Today, we support providers and health systems with our CuraScript specialty distribution capability and we continue to see meaningful growth in this aspect of our specialty pharmacy services.  Finally, an additional accelerated business is our U.S. government portfolio services. We are pleased with our recent Medicare stars quality rating showing that we again have over 2/3 of our members in 4-star or higher plans. This is recognition of the value we provide to seniors in supporting access as well as high-quality care.  With open enrollment now underway for both Medicare Advantage and the individual exchange business, we are balancing competitive benefit offerings, targeted market expansion and pricing discipline activity.  So to summarize, we are performing well across our diverse enterprise. And these highlights reinforce how our strategic framework guides us in accelerating innovation, expanding client relationships and continuing to broaden our reach.  Now as we look to 2024, we expect another strong year of performance for the Cigna Group as we build on momentum with EPS, revenue and cash flow growth. We'll share more detailed guidance with you on our fourth quarter earnings call as we always do.  The tailwinds and headwinds we expect in the year ahead remain largely consistent with our prior conversation, and we continue to be confident in our ability to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 per share in 2024.  Notable tailwinds include growth-related contributions, including the full launch of Centene, which starts on January 1, a growing positive impact of biosimilar contributions, and an improved margin profile in our individual exchange business.  In terms of headwinds, we will continue to make strategic investments across our portfolio of businesses to drive sustained innovation as well as position ourselves for long-term growth.  Now I'll just briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. We had another strong quarter, and it builds on good momentum throughout the course of the year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.77, as well as strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth.  Our company continues to deliver for the benefit of those we serve, and we have been able to increase our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, and we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $28 in 2024, which is consistent with our past discussions.  We are well positioned with a clear durable strategic framework that leverages the power of our differentiated services within our benefits portfolio and services portfolio.  And now Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian? It's David. I'll take the legislative question, a little tee up relative to the GLP-1 question in the broader marketplace, and I'll ask Eric to expand on the InCircle Rx program. Specific to legislation, as you know, we haven't continued to expect to operate in a very active regulatory and legislative environment. As a result, we remain active and constructively engaged in the ongoing dialogue. And by way of framing, before I get the specific, potential legislative activities, we positioned our company with a breadth of capabilities, both modular configured and otherwise, and value creation and value capture capabilities that we believe will be able to thrive and grow under a variety of environments.  I'd highlight an area where we have a lot of passion, and that is to ensure that and amplify the fact that any legislative regulatory activity should not remove choice, especially from the commercial market for employers as well as health plans given that they are large sophisticated organizations and fund the vast majority of the comprehensive benefit costs.  Having said that, there is intensified activity around transparency, and we are highly supportive of transparency so long it is targeted and constructive, meaning it could drive requisite level of actions on a go-forward basis.  As it relates to the innovation that's taking place, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned. We took very deliberate actions 5 years ago by acquiring Express Scripts, 3 years ago by launching Evernorth, our continued ongoing investment in our specialty capabilities, et cetera, are all oriented around positioning toward both today's class of drugs that we're seeing like the GLP-1s, but future innovations, be they for Alzheimer's, additional cancer therapies, gene therapies, et cetera. And we believe we're well positioned to support both commercial clients as well as health plans.  InCircle Rx is a wonderful new innovation. It's the first of its kind in the marketplace and highly supportive of clients.  Eric, can I ask you to expand on that? Kevin, it's David. I'd ask you to step back and first look at the consistency of our performance over the years relative to the portfolio. And if you look at the -- our EPS CAGR, even over the past several years, with a slight downtick this year because of the investments we've made to onboard Centene and our outlook for 2024, we remain consistently within our growth algorithm of 10% to 13% on average EPS CAGR as we've delivered that over the last 3 years, 5 years and 10-year time horizon.  We called out a few of the headwinds and tailwinds to try to amplify some of the components. I would suggest that the first component, the outsized growth, and specifically the Centene contribution, given the offset in 2023, you can view that one as more directionally additive. That pushes us to the high end of the range from an EPS growth standpoint versus the low end of the range.  The other items that we've talked about are largely contemplated in the core parts of our business and the core parts of our operations on a go-forward basis. And as Brian and I both noted, we'll give you more detailed guidance on our fourth quarter call, as we typically do. AJ, it's David. You've packed a lot in there. I'm going to ask Brian to start by framing the economics year-over-year on the Centene relationship, our investment, the year-over-year performance, et cetera.  Asking to transition that over to Eric, he could talk about how the relationship is going importantly. And I'll ask Eric to amplify a little bit relative to the biosimilar impact we're seeing in the latter part of this year and into next year. Brian? Josh, it's David. Let me speak to the commercial large market, and then frame your specific question relative to early traction with Village. And then I'm going to ask Eric to just describe a little bit more broadly the evolving relationship and the strategic work we continue to advance with Village.  First, specific to the commercial marketplace and the selling season. You did miss it, we didn't profile the 2024 outlook in any level of detail.  Stepping back, as Brian noted in his prior comment, we're really pleased with the 2023 results, now increasing the outlook for our overall lives for our Cigna Healthcare care portfolio, yet again, in excess of 1 million half lives, and coming off of a 2022 number, approaching 1 million lives.  For 2024, I give you some directional indicators at this point in time. First, big picture for the enterprise. We expect it to be another attractive year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, specific to the commercial marketplace, we expect within the commercial marketplace portfolio, our results continue to be led by our sustained strong performance. The combination of our select segment and our middle market segment where our value proposition and our products and services are resonating quite well. Strong retention and good new business adds within that portfolio.  And then specific to National Accounts. Currently, our outlook for 2024 is on the benefit side of the equation, after some outsized growth in 2023, 2024 will look a little bit more normalized relative to prior years. And to remind you, strategically for that segment, we've expected to see that segment be a flat to slightly shrinking segment in the market in aggregate within the employer landscape. Our strategy has us maintaining share and deepening our relationship with our clients through our further expanding portfolio of specialty services.  So to put a circle around it, it will be another strong year of growth for the Cigna Group in aggregate, and the commercial portfolio in 2024 will be led by the sustained strength of the select and the middle market business.  Specific to Villages, a quick tee up to your comment. Our commercial employers today already are seeing a step function to benefit from our relationship with Village and then the Village Summit acquisition in the nature in which we've structured that relationship. So we were able to deliver a step function of value to our commercial clients already, be they self-funded, be they shared returns, be they guarantee cost from that standpoint.  And then the team is aggressively at work to further enhance the value proposition there.  And Eric, I'll just ask you to provide a little color in terms of the way in which the teams are working together to advance the value-based care traction. Scott, it's David. Just a couple of comments, and I'll ask Brian to peel back a couple of your specific points.  First, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're pleased with the Stars position, the stable, strong Stars position we have, and continued traction of our ongoing focus to expand our geographic footprint. And then I'll ask Brian to expand on a little bit more significantly, as well as our ongoing investments in terms of our broad set of capabilities.  2023 was a very good year of growth for us in terms of this business portfolio, and our market expansion plans are on track for 2024. Brian, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit? It's David. Just a little framing. And consistent with prior conversations we've had. To date, within our benefits portfolio, you could think about 10% to 20% of our clients currently having adopted an optional buy-up or coverage for weight management outside of the already formulary positioning for diabetes for the drug class, number one. On the Evernorth side of the equation, as we've discussed before, the percentage is higher, and you can think about why the difference. The difference is within the Evernorth portfolio, the commercial employer landscape is larger employer size on average versus the diversity that exists on the Cigna Healthcare care side. And then within the health plan portfolio, enabling some aspect of it from an access. So that gives you little stage setting of the fluidity of the current environment.  Your question comes down to a fair amount of detail relative to pricing and working with the manufacturers. I'll ask Eric to talk just more broadly, this is an area where, as we discussed in our prepared remarks, where the broad capabilities of our Evernorth portfolio significantly thrive in terms of data clinical aspects, clinical coordination, relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers and importantly, relationship with practicing physicians to get the best coordinated care.  So Eric, could I ask you to expand on that a little bit? Lance, it's David. I'll take the first part of your question. I'll ask Brian to address the second part of your question. . First, specific to Part D broadly, with the size, shape and scope of our enterprise today, it's a portion of our enterprise, but I would call it as not a significant part of our overall portfolio. That's not to dismiss the importance of it from a societal standpoint, by any stretch of imagination. But when you look at the scope of our enterprise approaching $200 billion of revenue this year, I would not call it as a significant component.  Secondly, inferred in your question, I would submit that we've underrealized or underleveraged the potential to effectively convert PDP lives or enroll PDP lives into MA. That's an untapped opportunity that exists within our portfolio today relative to our level of activity and initiation.  Lastly, in your comment, we do recognize that the PDP landscape is disrupted, based on some of the legislative and policy activities that have transpired. And we will effectively position our portfolio, obviously, to be responsive to that disruption. But we have the tools to be able to manage within our portfolio in totality.  I'll ask Brian to pick up the second piece of your question, just relative to the script volume and the puts and takes in the portfolio this past quarter. First and foremost, thank you again for joining our call today and for the ongoing conversation.  Just to highlight and summarize our dialogue today, we are very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the momentum we've been able to carry now through 3 quarters of the year. And we remain on track to deliver our overall commitments for 2023.  We increased our outlook for adjusted EPS to at least $24.75 for full year 2023, as well as increasing the overall outlook we have for revenue, customer lives and cash flow based on our strong performance. And remain committed to our 2024 EPS objective of at least $28.  I do want to pause for a moment and thank my colleagues around the world. The health care landscape continues to change, with accelerated forces impacting our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners. And our team leads in day in, day out, working to make a positive difference, for those we have the benefit to serve, those we have the benefit to partner with, as well as our orientation around making a positive difference in the communities we work, serve and play in each and every day.  So I want to call out and thank our colleagues that continue to make such a positive difference in the marketplace each and every day.  With that, we look forward to our ongoing conversation and our future dialogues, both in person and investor events as well as our fourth quarter conversation coming up. Have a great day."

            "name": "Eric Palmer",
            "content": "Sure, David. Lisa, It's Eric. As you can imagine, there is significant interest and need from our clients on the InCircle Rx program and helping them with GLP-1s more broadly. They're looking for our help with managing the affordability and ensuring that they get good outcomes from the spending on these treatments.  As David teed up, I'm really excited about, and I think the InCircle Rx program is a great example of the power of the collective capabilities that we have within Evernorth. It's the first of its kind, comprehensive solution that brings together our supply chain and procurement expertise, along with our clinical capabilities to target the right patient population, the relevant clinical markers, it targets the pharmacy network management, working to eliminate any waste or use in the system, and it works to engage patients with additional support that they need to help make changes that makes the impact last year. And we wrap this all with a guarantee of clinical outcomes and such for our clients as well.  So we're -- in short, we're really optimistic and excited about the opportunity for this product brings to self-funded markets and would expect additional growth as we look into 2024 and beyond. Sure. we've said from the beginning that the adoption of biosimilars is going to be more extended and slower process. And the experience to date has been consistent with our expectations. We've driven meaningful savings for the benefit of our customers and clients so far this year, and we continue to see this opportunity ramp throughout the course of next year, and as part of the market ongoing.  We've talked in other settings about the meaningful opportunity for biosimilars, not only for [indiscernible] but for other conditions, and expect there to be more competition over time where up to 25% or 30% of the spend in the specialty market, we'll have competition, compared to something like less than 10% today.  So in short, this is an area that we're well positioned to drive meaningful value for the benefit of our customers and clients that we have seen unfolding consistent with our expectations. And we're positioned to lead through over the course of the coming years. Sure. Stepping back a bit for Village, have you think about both the financial and the strategic component of our relationship with Village, as you know, we got a minority stake of ownership now. And so that's performing consistent with our expectations.  From a strategic perspective, think of our work with Village is one Village and us being committed partners to work together. We're working to build an alignment of an ecosystem of high-performing providers where we can ramp Village and Summit's operations with some of our clinical assets, raft and support with the data and insights from both organizations to help to ensure patients can get to the best care they need, the best specialists they need, the highest quality, et cetera.  And I really think of that as ultimately applicable across commercial or government plans. Our focus in the near term has been, I'll say, more skewed towards the commercial market, but it's an approach that works across any payer here, right, because it focuses on getting to the highest quality, best care available for an individual. And that transcends across all the markets.  Over time, we'll work to continue to expand this. But to date, off to a good start and pleased with the progress and the momentum that we're building with our partnership with Village. Great. So with respect to this, Stepping back, I would have you think about the impact here that will need to unfold, will be around improving affordability. As has been said and reported across a variety of different channels, these therapies are effective, but they're also very expensive. We would expect that over time, we'll be well positioned to harness the power of competition to improve the affordability to bring the cost down. That's an important element.  But then in addition to that, we're positioned to wrap and support these patients with additional services, clinical services, the right approach, the right targeting to ensure the maximum effectiveness here.  So I don't know that it's constructive to talk about any of the kind of ongoing dialogue with manufacturers. But rest assured, that we are very engaged with the variety of pharma manufacturers in this space, looking at ways to expand access and improve affordability, just like Express Scripts is a long history of doing, as new innovations have come to the market and the pharmacy space, and we'll continue to be a leader there."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and we'll review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this call, including the question-and-answer session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. Following their prepared remarks David, Brian, and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results, in the second quarter, we recorded after-tax special item charges of $5 million, or $0.01 per share, for the integration and transaction-related costs. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that, I will turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I will review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and why we believe we are well-positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. Brian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions. With that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We are pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses. In Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business, harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and, to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter, including launching Copay Assurance to support further affordability for patients, and ClearCareRX to provide our clients with broader choice. We also introduced [Independent Rx] (ph), which is a first-of-its-kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way through the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity and we are encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them. Our client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we are making good progress for implementation with Centene, which begins on January of 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make Accredo a differentiated leader in this space. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we are delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients, as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable plans and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings. In our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio was generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk [adjuster] (ph) impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024. And in our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the [globally mobile] (ph) population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results showed that The Cigna Group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our company and delivering on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth, as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023. Now, I will talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs, as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses. Additionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships, as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross-enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, are capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients and their clinical care teams, as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives. Today, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing needs and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcomed a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at one of our Accredo clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise, a critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieve for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions. Here are a few headlines from the day at Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Nearly five years ago when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Accredo was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. And in 2023, serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue, and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second, these secular tailwinds in the market create significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total healthcare costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion. Biosimilars represent force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much-needed affordability improvements for those we serve and thereby create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future. Third is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and social workers specializing in different disease states, such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers. Unlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses. Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health. With the clinical care model focused on each individual patient, we are able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and rare conditions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note, drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities, as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique, coordinated clinical model. Putting all this together, we are excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy, and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future. Now, stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28.00 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now, Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian?\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include: revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion; after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $6.13; and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Revenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our two platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top- and bottom-line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly. First, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance. With second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, harnessing data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024, and advance our technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well-positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter. After receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by two states. Within those two states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million, and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year, as we have taken corrective pricing actions and the impact to geographies in our 2024 rate filings. Specific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year. Our year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation across both Commercial and Medicare Advantage. Turning to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially, and year-to-date, Medicare Advantage has grown 12%. Overall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals, despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned, and we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability. Now, turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share, and we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings cadence, we expect mid-single digit year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter, and mid to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%. Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now, to recap, second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70, and we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.00, consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the color on the risk adjustment dynamics. I think that helps also explain some of the rate increases that we've seen you filing in some of those pertinent states like Georgia for 2024. My question is if we back out the risk adjustment impacts from both '22 and '23, can you give us an update on how you view sort of underlying utilization and cost trends in the marketplace and the individual business for 2023? And how you'd say sort of core, I guess, exchange margins are tracking towards your longer-term view in '23? And as you put these price increases in for '24, how that will sync up relative to the long-term sort of 4% to 6% pre-tax margins that you've historically sort of managed the individual business for? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. I'll try to take each of those bites kind of one at a time. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in the quarter, we had an $80 million impact from the risk adjustment payable matter in 2023, which reflects essentially a true-up for the first two quarters of the year. But that was largely offset in the quarter by the favorable true-up we had on the 2022 risk adjustment settlement. The other residual piece within the individual exchange business is we had some favorable claim cost experience in the first half of the year. So, the $80 million was offset largely by the 2022 risk adjustment settlement, but also, to a lesser degree, by favorable cost trend within our individual exchange business, which reflects a younger, healthier population than what we had in 2022. So claim costs there, certainly within check, but we had the larger payable, which creates the pressure point for the year. As it relates to the profit margins and how to think about where we are in '23 and the rate increase impact on '24, just for some context here, you can think of this business being approximately a $5 billion block for us in 2023 in terms of premium revenue. And we had shared on a prior call that we were anticipating the individual exchange book to run below our target margins within 2023. As you noted, our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. For the remainder of this year, we're expecting another $80 million of risk adjustment payable impact across the second half, which, as I mentioned, will be offset by the strength across the broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio, including expense efficiencies. But when you put all this together, the individual exchange margins in 2023 will be below our prior estimates. And for 2024, we have taken sizable price increases in our two largest states. So we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual exchange book overall in '24 relative to '23. The exact amount of that margin improvement will end up being a function of our geographic and customer mix in 2024 as we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business in 2024 relative to where we are in 2023. So, thanks for the question. Hopefully, you can follow all those moving pieces.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fidel. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I know at this point in the year, large employers are well on their way to thinking about their '24 outlook as -- both from health benefits and also on the pharmacy benefit side. I wondered if given you've got a great window on all of that, anything interesting to call out in terms of priorities for employers around benefit design, focus on particular categories of healthcare, whether -- I know sometimes it's diabetes, sometimes family planning. Anything on the cost management focus? I know there's a lot of discussion about GLP-1s, and wonder whether they're focused on trying to manage that more effectively. And then, just overall expectations in those customers around cost trends and -- are they assuming it's sort of a more normalized outlook going into '24, or are they making any assumptions about pent-up demand or anything?\nDavid Cordani: A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me describe a little bit of the -- we'll say the buying characteristics and areas of focus in the market more broadly, and then I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of the pharmacy specific space and using your GLP-1 as an example. So, stepping back, and it's for the latter part of your comment to reinforce it, the buying behaviors continue to have an intense focus on, what I will call, base buying needs focused on affordability, coupled with consistent high-quality service levels. There's two additional dimensions, I would say, that have intensified recently relative to need state. One, as employers, because you're coming at through the employee lens, continue to intensify their focus on having healthy, engaged, highly-productive workforce. They're intensifying their focus and need and awareness of the complex behavioral health needs from their population, inclusive of, but also beyond the more intense behavioral health dimensions. This includes anxiety, stress, depression and complexity to come along with that. Here, I would note that within our Cigna Group portfolio of solutions, we're well positioned to meet the needs, because there's a lot of coordination that's necessary to advance there. The second trend I'd highlight is what the marketplace is sometimes calling point solution fatigue, where over time, employers have aggregated many individual point solutions that made sense at a given moment in time, but they find themselves stepping back and looking at that inventory, questioning whether or not either, a, they're getting all the value out of each individual solution, or b, the friction and/or abrasion for their coworkers or medical professionals is worth the value of the fractured point solutions, and therefore, are challenging more opportunities to coordinate or integrate solutions to get more value, leverage and better service from that standpoint. And again, our portfolio is really well positioned there and continues to resonate in the market as evidenced by our growth. I'll ask Eric to provide a little bit of color of areas of focus for buyers more broadly in pharmacy, including the GLP-1.\nEric Palmer: Great. Thanks, David. Good morning, A.J. I'll start with the GLP-1. GLP-1s are definitely top of mind for many of our clients. There's been a meaningful uptick in utilization here. And as I think you know, we have coverage for these medications on our formularies from early on for value-based arrangements with pharma manufacturers. We've seen contributions for the benefit of patients and our clients by result of those -- the structures. We have recently launched a program called ENCIRCLERX, which brings together management of the GLP-1, cardiac, diabetic conditions, obesity. So these conditions often tend to be interrelated, to bring together a benefit plan design, the clinical support as necessary and the overall resources we can bring to help these patients, better manage their health and ultimately get to a better plan costs. So, at GLP-1 and the broader cardiac, obesity, diabetes space is a real area of focus. I would also note, as David touched on in his comments, continued interest in behavioral solutions. That's an area that we've got strong expertise within Evernorth, and we're excited about the opportunities in that market and the need to help manage behavioral care more effectively. Those will probably be the top couple of specific themes I would call out at this point, A.J.\nA.J. Rice: All right. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. A couple of quick questions. One, just so I appreciate your comments on cost trend, but did see a pretty big pickup in medical costs payable in the quarter relative to reserve growth. Just curious what drove that. And then, just stepping back, the stop loss business has seen a nice acceleration this year, up in the teens. Just curious what you're seeing there. And do you expect that to be the kind of the trajectory after we've seen a bit of a slowdown over the last few years? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll start, and I think David will pile on in terms of the stop loss component. So, as it relates to our medical cost payables or reserves, nothing particular I'd flag here. We continue to employ a consistent methodology as it relates to how we set our reserves. There'll be some natural variability in this metric as product mix shift tends to occur from quarter-to-quarter. And I know the days claims payable metric is one that's commonly looked at. We don't target or forecast any specific level of DCP rather this is more the output of our detailed assumption setting that's -- then aggregated up to the enterprise level. So, we remain comfortable with our reserving methodology and confidence in the adequacy of the balance sheet. As it relates to stop loss, you're right, we're seeing nice growth in that product line. We've got 13% year-on-year premium growth. We're on track to achieve our target profitability in that business this year. So nice performance, and it continues to resonate with our clients. David, anything you want to add in that regard?\nDavid Cordani: Yes. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Justin. The item I amplify is, Justin, as you recall from prior conversations, part of our consultative approach and go-to-market approach is when you work with clients of a variety of sizes around the benefit design that matches their strategy, the clinical programs in support of that, that match your strategy, the service support programs that match your strategy. The final thing we work on is the funding mechanism. And as the market conditions change, we have the ability to flex between risk or guarantee cost, shared returns and/or self-funded with stop loss. And our stop loss program, as you call out, continues to perform well, grow well and resonate in the marketplace because it provides that peace of mind and predictability for employers around their cash flow and any dislocation that may happen in a given year. So, our specialists in that space have a high-performing book. It continues to resonate well. And you'll see ebb and flow over time based on market buying conditions, but continued growth.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. I just want to come back to the pharmacy side of the business for a minute and ask a couple of questions. One, when I think about the quarter, can you talk about the margin impact from: one, GLP-1s? I know you talked about strength there; two, the shift to biosimilars?; and three, the Centene implementation costs? Can you just talk about how each of those had an impact on the margin in the quarter? And then, just as a follow-up, when you talked about the 2024 selling season, more specific on the PBM side, can you maybe just give a little more detail as to how renewals went and what your retention rates are expected to be for '24? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Lisa. It's Brian. I'll start. I think that's a multiparter, and then Eric is going to chime in with some comments on the sales season. But as it relates to the quarter, overall, Evernorth continues to perform really well. So, I'd start there. Largely in line with our expectations when you put all the different moving pieces together. The individual components you kind of called out there, Eric referenced earlier, GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings at this point in time, whether that be for diabetic indications or non-diabetic indications. So that's certainly a net positive relative to the Evernorth business in 2023. On the biosimilar side of the house, you should think of, thus far, relatively low adoption of Amjevita in the first half of the year. On the second half of the year, we obviously added two additional biosimilars into the National Preferred Formulary. And one of the reasons we expect acceleration in income growth in the third and fourth quarter is the impact of greater biosimilar adoption as well as improved overall positioning relative to the dynamics of competitiveness across the four drugs that will be on the National Preferred Formulary. But in the second quarter, I wouldn't characterize biosimilars as a particular driver of the margin profile. On the Centene impact, we remain very much on track relative to the implementation against our commitments. As we mentioned before, we expect to spend about $200 million over the course of 2023. You should think of that as gradually building quarter-to-quarter over the course of the year. And so, the money is being spent as we speak. And all those factors did impact the second quarter. But again, nothing in particular I would call out being significantly deviating from our expectations compared to what we expected three months ago. Eric, maybe you can pick up both on Centene and the selling season.\nEric Palmer: Great. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Lisa. So, just a couple of other comments that I had on Centene. I'm really pleased with how we are working together to deliver an implementation program to serve Centene's customers. We are on track, and there's good momentum in the readiness for our January '24 implementation. So, continue to be excited about that opportunity. With respect to the selling season more broadly, we operate in a competitive market, and the strength of our solutions really continues to resonate. We will deliver another strong retention rate. As we look to the 2024, I think mid-90%-s or higher, and consistent with our prior commentary around what a strong retention rate looks like. We'll have additional new growth, new client wins on top of the large Centene win as well. So, feeling good as we kind of wind down the 2024 selling season at this point, and we'll provide more detail on that when we provide our 2024 guidance later on.\nLisa Gill: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to get a little more color on the increased enrollment outlook. I guess you've indicated in the past that you're being a little bit concerned about recessions and determinations. Were those -- anything changed there to drive that? Or was it new customer growth? Just a little color. Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, I'll start, and I think your question is specific to Cigna Healthcare, which is where I'll go. So, first off, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare book. If you look at our year-to-date customer growth, it's running ahead of expectations at $1.5 million net growth, and that builds off of a strong performance we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As it relates to our refreshed membership outlook for the year, you can think of the primary driver of that being an elevated expectation for individual exchange customers by year-end 2023. The other components of the Cigna Healthcare customer outlook are broadly unchanged from our prior projections. We're not yet seeing meaningful signs of any economic pressure within our commercial book of business. But that said, we have assumed some elevated disenrollment in the U.S. commercial business in the second half of 2023 in order to be prudent. We continue to exclude any potential Medicaid redetermination lives from our commercial forecast for the balance of the year. And taken all together, again, pleased to see a full year outlook of 8% growth in total medical customers across Cigna Healthcare. One minor refinement we made this year or this quarter relative to the individual exchange business is, we are now forecasting some level of Medicaid redeterminations coming in through the balance of the year. So, you should think of the commercial business, excluding Medicaid redetermination, the individual forecast now including some level of redeterminations for the balance of the year.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Just clarification on the exchange true-ups and the impact there. I just want to make sure I get this right. I assume you've got a bigger payable, but that probably means that your claims costs are coming in a little bit better. So I just want to see if there's actually -- and offset from the receivable from last year. So I just want to see if there's actually an EPS impact expected for this year. And then my real question is, just could you speak to your MA bid strategy for 2024? I'm specifically interested in how you're thinking about benefit design in light of rates and the risk model changes? And then, if there's anything to talk about the VillageMD partnership, if that impacts any way you're bidding in certain markets?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Josh. It's Brian. So, I'll take the first one, and then David will pick up on the Medicare Advantage question. So, as it relates to the different payable dynamics, let me try to give you the full picture here. So, just for some context, we ended the quarter with about 820,000 customers in the individual exchange business. That was up significantly from where we were at the end of 2022. And during the 2022 year, we were in a risk adjustment receivable position on this business. So, when we stepped into '23, we had been anticipating that, that would switch over and that will -- we'd be in a payable position for 2023. The first look we got at the industry-wide risk adjustment data that we received in early July indicated that we'll be in an even greater payable position for the 2023 plan year, and that was driven by two large states. Those two large states represent about half of the individual exchange premium base. And the adjustment in the first half of the year that came through the second quarter was an $80 million increase in the payable. That was offset largely by a favorable true-up on the 2022 receivable. You can think of that in the range of about $50 million. And then the residual is primarily driven by favorable claim costs in 2023 relative to our expectations. So that favorability in the 2023 claim costs partially offset the increased payable that we have -- that ran through the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps to square the picture a little bit on the individual exchange business. David, do you want to pick up on MA?\nDavid Cordani: Sure, Brian, thanks. Good morning, Josh. So, you had two questions. Specific to MA and our bid strategy, I'll just speak more broadly. I'm not going to go into detail specifically, Josh, just to manage expectations given the time cycle and the competitive nature. First and foremost, as I noted, we're pleased with our growth in 2023, point one. Two, as we look to 2024 to some of the points you made reference to, we expect to see larger-than-average local market variability in terms of offering and positioning by competitors. And at this point, I would highlight and reinforce that we remain convicted to and comfortable with our bid assumptions relative to underlying medical costs based upon what we've seen through the first two quarters of the year and our outlook for the year. I'd also note that our [stars] (ph) position coming into the cycle is consistent and strong and our early look at the stars on a go-forward basis remains consistent and strong from that standpoint. Specifically to your last point around Village, first and foremost, I'd ask you to think about initiating the relationship with Village, we seek to have a long-term strategic positive impact. I would note that day one for the benefit of our customers who are experiencing Village and Summit relationships, they began to see benefits immediately by the nature of the structure of our relationship. And then, we continue to collaborate, innovate on value-based care, whether it's leveraging some Evernorth capabilities like behavioral, virtual or other services, and/or go more deeply into individual markets around more precisely leveraging data and insights to curate sub-specialty networks to get the best possible quality and cost and affordability. That benefit will continue to mount as we go forward, and to the core of your question, contribute to market by market, our posture in MA. But specifically, we're driving this initiative with Village and with our Evernorth team to benefit our commercial space as well. So, we're pleased with the early traction, a lot of work to do, and it will continue to yield dividends both today and into the future. Thanks, Josh.\nJosh Raskin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. I wanted to go back to biosimilars. How has the pricing of biosimilar of Humira compared to expectations as more competition come to market? And given what appears to be a very significant reduction in pricing, does that pull forward the benefit from the Humira biosimilar at all? And for the different options that you added to the formulary, should we think of the economics of each of those as being similar to Evernorth? And then, just a quick follow-up on the Cigna Healthcare segment. Brian, could you maybe help us think through the seasonality this year and maybe why that's different than a typical year? And as we think about the 2024 and going forward, do you go back to more normal seasonality in that business? Thank you.\nEric Palmer: Good morning, Nathan. It's Eric. I'll start. So, as you noted and implied in your question, biosimilars are a really important opportunity to drive competition and for us to then help to make that competition efficient to drive improvements to the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. Now, in 2023, we've continued to co-prefer Humira on the formulary. Towards the beginning of the year, we added Amjevita to our National Preferred Formulary and recently added Cyltezo and Sandoz's products, both the low and high [indiscernible] versions onto the NPF. So that's the activity that's gotten us to this point to date. I would note, we work through with the manufacturers on the terms of those to drive to the best available cost, the best available expense for our clients. And we have visibility into that pretty early on. So, we've navigated and made our arrangements in constructing the placement such as we came into this year. And so, I wouldn't want you to think about there being dynamics kind of playing out simultaneously. These are things we have negotiated in advance. We have visibility into as the products come into the market and we work to leverage the competition to continue to improve affordability for the benefit of the clients we serve. Over time, as we drive even more products, more competition, we'll work to continue to bring improved levels of affordability to our clients and continue to construct our offerings in a way that best meet their needs. I hand it over to Brian on the second part of your question.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Nathan. It's Brian. So, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare seasonality, I'd start -- just to remind you, we expect the second half earnings to be a little bit less than 55% in the third quarter. Relative to the MCR component of that, our prior expectations on the MCR seasonality have not changed. So, what I mean by that is the directional pattern we saw, for example, in 2022 on MCR is a reasonable proxy for what we'd expect the 2023 quarterly pattern to be, and as a result, the fourth quarter MCR is likely to be the highest quarter of the year as we see more customers meet their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum obligations. However, we do expect the pace of SG&A spending to look different than it did last year. For example, we had a step up in SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter of '23. The other item that I call your attention to is our net investment income in the fourth quarter of '22 was considerably weaker than what we're expecting to see in the fourth quarter of '23. So, those are the primary things to think through as it relates to the seasonality pattern. As it relates to '24. At this point in time, there's nothing I'd call your attention to that will lead us to think there's any abnormal pattern.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess to the extent that your Medicare Advantage book is seeing a more normalized utilization trend this year that you baked into your pricing and guidance, just curious if you have any additional color just for the second quarter and whether it normalized more in the outpatient setting versus inpatient. I just want to hear a little more color on some of the trends by cost category, just given how topical this is for the industry this quarter. Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, as you noted, we planned and priced for more normalized utilization levels in 2023, and our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation. So, within the MA book specifically to the core of your question, we have seen elevated utilization of both outpatient and professional services all year. But important this should be viewed in the context of what we had forecasted and priced for. So, the overall cost trends are largely in line with our expectations in both our second half 2023 guidance and our 2024 bids. Anticipate that, that dynamic will continue, as it relates to specifically within outpatient and professional surgeries are the area that I'd call your attention to, in particular, orthopedic and cardiovascular, we did see some level of favorability in inpatients. So those are a few of the subcategories that I'd call your attention to, but all in line with what we had anticipated coming into the year.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay. That's perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah, hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about some of the moving parts in the P&L this year for Evernorth. In the first half, there's a pretty notable divergence in the growth of revenue and gross profit. And then, what you've seen dropped through to earnings. I know that Centene is a big part of that and the investments you're making there. But the trend underneath that still feels like it's pretty notable. Any additional color on what's going on within Evernorth SG&A would be helpful. Whether that's investments or mix or anything else that we should be keeping in mind? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Hey, Steve, it's Brian. So, a few things I'd call your attention to in regards to the profitability margins relative to revenue. We had an expansion of our relationship with the Department of Defense that was effective on January 1, and we had some additional spending that we're kind of working our way into in terms of growing into that. So that certainly weighed down the income growth a bit in the first half of the year. To your point, the rate and pace of investments, particularly around the accelerated growth businesses in Evernorth, both the healthcare services as well as the Accredo specialty pharmacy also impacted the income growth. And then for the back half of the year, we expect accelerated income growth, again, mid-single digits in the third quarter, mid- to high-single digits in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the increased ramp for biosimilars. And I would note that, that's not predicated on any meaningful share shift. We have strong visibility to that income emerging in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from John Ransom with Raymond James. You may ask your question. John Ransom, your line is open. You may ask your question. Seems like he is not responding. We'll go ahead to Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question. Your line is open.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I know it's a small piece of the business, but the other revenue inside of Evernorth grew 35% this quarter, accelerating actually versus the prior quarter. I guess it's becoming, to some degree, a meaningful portion of the segment. I guess, could you talk about what's driving that growth? And how should we think about the margin profile that's attached to that business?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, George. It's Brian. I'll start and then Eric can pick up a bit. So yes, the fees and other revenue in Evernorth is a strong driver of growth, granted off of a low base. So, important to keep that in mind as you think about the overall P&L. Multiple areas of growth underneath this line. One I'd call out is we're seeing increased demand for PBM service-based solutions, meaning more fee-oriented relationships as we have more and more clients looking for those types of mechanisms. We also have contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses reflected here. So, for example, MDLive and eviCore are both contributing to that. And then if you're looking at pharmacy other revenue, the CuraScript Specialty Distribution business has been a strong grower year-on-year. You also recall from some of our prior conversations that we're very focused on driving cross-enterprise leverage between the Cigna Healthcare business and Evernorth. So, as Cigna Healthcare procures more and more services from Evernorth, we have some benefit that comes through the fees and the other revenue lines in Evernorth from that as well. So, Eric, anything you want to add in terms of further color?\nEric Palmer: Brian, thanks. You've hit the headlines in terms of the main drivers here financially. Well, just to note, on the fee-based portion of the PBM in particular, this is an area that we've continued to accelerate. David made reference in his prepared remarks around our ClearCareRx program. This builds off of a couple of years of experience that we've got in providing fee-based fully-aligned mechanisms in terms of providing the pharmacy benefit, and so those fee types of arrangements will come through there. I would say, have you think about the margin profile for that business is very consistent with the other businesses in Express Scripts and the like. And then likewise, the growth in our MDLive and behavioral platforms continue to be an area of real focus for us and continued momentum into that driver as well. And I would have you think about those margins is also generally in line with the Evernorth segment overall. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity and the momentum that we're building in all of the different lines across the Evernorth portfolio, and you're seeing the growth there come through that line.\nGeorge Hill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. Our last question comes from Mr. Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks. A question on the specialty products in the Healthcare segment. And just had kind of three elements to it. One was, what sort of utilization trends you were seeing in behavioral, dental and some of the other areas where you're taking some risk? And then a broader question, just understanding, how much specialty is contributing to the earnings power of the business versus just the core medical? And what do you think the cross-sell opportunities might still remain for that business? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. I'll start, and then David, if you want to chime in with anything, feel free. So, for a long period of time, as I think you know, our specialty products within Cigna Healthcare been a really core part of the value proposition as we seek to expand client relationships. So, we have few clients that only purchase medical services from us more and more purchase a full suite because we've demonstrated over time our clinical models perform best when we have a fuller suite of services. As it relates to what we're seeing in terms of trends in terms of utilization, behavioral health has certainly been growing at a strong clip, not just this year, but for the past few years. Part of that is by design as we engage with our customers. And over time, that's a good thing because the more utilization we see in behavioral health services, it helps to defray core medical costs over time. We've also seen an uptick in dental utilization this year as well, but all of these things are within, again, the boundaries of what we had forecasted and planned for and priced for within our Cigna Healthcare book of business, which is why you're seeing our commercial employer business continue to perform so well financially. And again, that line is on track to achieve target margins here in 2023. David, anything you want to pick up on here?\nDavid Cordani: Sure, Brian. Thanks. Good morning, Lance. A few items to highlight, specifically, just click down a little more notch, in behavioral, as Brian noted, elevated trend and as you would expect, and over a prolonged period of time, I think the last three to five years, as you click down in it, think about the professional services as such, we continue to innovate new products, new programs, expansion of network, both physical network, we operate the largest virtual behavioral network in America today, and then expanding behavioral services even further in our value-based care programs to help medical professionals be a first line of screening and support from that standpoint. To the last part of your question around the expansion opportunities within our portfolio, you know our portfolio well in terms of the healthcare side of the equation. If you think about the old monikers of Select, I think under 500 employees, middle market, 500 to 5,000 old monikers, and Nashville above 5,000, multi-geographic. Select, you still think about that as totally cross-sold and penetrated. We go to market with bundled solutions. It's a big part of our value proposition. Helps us generate a predictable high quality, low trend and outcome. Middle market remains and has a high level of penetration, yet there are cross-sell opportunities. And national accounts, a lower level of penetration versus the other segments. However, as I noted to A.J.'s question, the point solution fatigue in the marketplace presents it even further opportunity as you coordinate those services. The last note I would make is as we leverage the breadth of the Evernorth capabilities today and into the future, we're innovating new solutions. So, you'll hear us talk more about [path wall] (ph) programs to take specific diagnoses and look at reengineering those episodes of care end-to-end. And in cases to your phraseology, we take risk based on the performance, we hold ourself accountable based upon the clinical service and financial outcomes. So, strong penetration down market, opportunities upmarket, market buying behavior is evolving because of point solution fatigue, and importantly, continued innovation will continue to drive growth for us there. Thanks, Lance.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. I will now turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you for your engagement and questions today. I just want to highlight a few items. We stepped into 2023 with strong growth and have been successful in building beyond that momentum throughout the first half of the year. We remain confident that we'll deliver on our commitments, including our adjusted EPS outlook for 2023 of at least $24.70 and our commitment for at least $28.00 of EPS in 2024. I'd also know how proud and appreciative I am of our colleagues around the world who continue to be dedicated to driving innovation and delivering on the programs and solutions, as well as partnerships that support every day the health and vitality of our customers, our patients and our clients. As always, we look forward to talking to you again soon about how we're working to sustain the growth of our company and capture more opportunities to serve more lives and achieve a greater impact, and we continue to invest in our future every day to drive further innovation. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Cigna Group's second quarter 2023 results review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. Second quarter results were strong, reflecting continued execution across the enterprise. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include: revenue growth of 7% to $48.6 billion; after-tax adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion; adjusted earnings per share of $6.13; and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. Revenue and cash flow both exceeded expectations, while adjusted earnings per share were slightly ahead of expectations. Our two platforms continue to perform well, with Evernorth posting solid top- and bottom-line growth, while Cigna Healthcare delivered results in line with expectations despite an unfavorable risk adjustment impact in our individual exchange business, which I will discuss shortly. First, turning to Evernorth results. Evernorth continues to deliver strong performance. With second quarter 2023 revenues growing 10% to $38.2 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.5 billion. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our differentiated specialty pharmacy business, which had year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and our focus on providing a variety of solutions that drive affordability and lowest net cost for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build out our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, harnessing data and technology to accelerate innovation for customers and clients. And we also continue to make strategic investments to further enhance and expand our client relationships, diversify our portfolio of products and services, prepare for new clients in 2024, and advance our technology capabilities. Overall, Evernorth has delivered strong first half results and we are well-positioned as we look to the back half of the year. Our diversified solutions allow us to sustain momentum by delivering differentiated value to our customers and clients, helping them overcome key healthcare challenges. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 81.2%. The medical care ratio reflects some items specific to our individual exchange business that largely offset one another in the quarter. After receiving our first view of industry-wide risk adjustment data in early July, we increased our full year 2023 estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable. It's important to note, this was primarily driven by two states. Within those two states, the unfavorable impact from the first half of 2023 was about $80 million, and was recognized in the second quarter. We expect a similar magnitude of impact in the back half of the year. Additionally, this impact is isolated to the 2023 calendar year, as we have taken corrective pricing actions and the impact to geographies in our 2024 rate filings. Specific to the second quarter, the unfavorable risk adjustment payable impact was largely offset by a favorable update to our 2022 risk adjustment receivable within the individual exchange business. Underlying fundamentals across the Cigna Healthcare segment continued to perform well as we further expanded our relationships and delivered affordability for our customers and clients. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we planned and priced for more normalized levels of utilization this year. Our year-to-date claims experience has been broadly in line with this expectation across both Commercial and Medicare Advantage. Turning to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers year-to-date across all businesses. Within our government business, medical customers grew sequentially, and year-to-date, Medicare Advantage has grown 12%. Overall, Cigna Healthcare's results in the quarter were solid as we demonstrated strong underlying fundamentals, despite the increased 2023 individual exchange risk adjustment payable previously mentioned, and we continue to grow our customer and client relationships, providing differentiated value and driving affordability. Now, turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $190 billion, driven by continued strength in our businesses as we continue to deliver innovative services and solutions for the benefit of our customers, patients and clients. We are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $24.70 per share, and we expect adjusted EPS to be split approximately evenly between the third and fourth quarters. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. With respect to Evernorth earnings cadence, we expect mid-single digit year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the third quarter, and mid to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth in the fourth quarter. In Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $4.425 billion. We expect third quarter Cigna Healthcare adjusted earnings to be slightly below 55% of second half adjusted earnings to reflect seasonal patterns as well as the rate and pace of investments. This incorporates the impact from the estimated individual exchange risk adjustment payable in the second half of the year, which is offset by other items in Cigna Healthcare, including expense efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to expect our 2023 medical care ratio to be within the range of 81.5% to 82.3%. Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Year-to-date through August 2, 2023, we have repurchased approximately $3.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. The continued strength of our cash generation gives us the confidence to increase our full year 2023 expected cash flow from operations by $500 million to at least $9.5 billion for the full year. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remain strong, benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins and attractive returns on capital. Now, to recap, second quarter results were strong, reflecting high-quality underlying fundamentals in our foundational and accelerated businesses, giving us confidence to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of at least $24.70, and we continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28.00, consistent with our prior commentary. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning, Scott. It's Brian. I'll try to take each of those bites kind of one at a time. So, as I mentioned in my comments, in the quarter, we had an $80 million impact from the risk adjustment payable matter in 2023, which reflects essentially a true-up for the first two quarters of the year. But that was largely offset in the quarter by the favorable true-up we had on the 2022 risk adjustment settlement. The other residual piece within the individual exchange business is we had some favorable claim cost experience in the first half of the year. So, the $80 million was offset largely by the 2022 risk adjustment settlement, but also, to a lesser degree, by favorable cost trend within our individual exchange business, which reflects a younger, healthier population than what we had in 2022. So claim costs there, certainly within check, but we had the larger payable, which creates the pressure point for the year. As it relates to the profit margins and how to think about where we are in '23 and the rate increase impact on '24, just for some context here, you can think of this business being approximately a $5 billion block for us in 2023 in terms of premium revenue. And we had shared on a prior call that we were anticipating the individual exchange book to run below our target margins within 2023. As you noted, our long-term target for this business is 4% to 6%. For the remainder of this year, we're expecting another $80 million of risk adjustment payable impact across the second half, which, as I mentioned, will be offset by the strength across the broader Cigna Healthcare portfolio, including expense efficiencies. But when you put all this together, the individual exchange margins in 2023 will be below our prior estimates. And for 2024, we have taken sizable price increases in our two largest states. So we would expect some degree of margin expansion in the individual exchange book overall in '24 relative to '23. The exact amount of that margin improvement will end up being a function of our geographic and customer mix in 2024 as we are likely to have fewer customers in the individual exchange business in 2024 relative to where we are in 2023. So, thanks for the question. Hopefully, you can follow all those moving pieces. Good morning, Justin. It's Brian. I'll start, and I think David will pile on in terms of the stop loss component. So, as it relates to our medical cost payables or reserves, nothing particular I'd flag here. We continue to employ a consistent methodology as it relates to how we set our reserves. There'll be some natural variability in this metric as product mix shift tends to occur from quarter-to-quarter. And I know the days claims payable metric is one that's commonly looked at. We don't target or forecast any specific level of DCP rather this is more the output of our detailed assumption setting that's -- then aggregated up to the enterprise level. So, we remain comfortable with our reserving methodology and confidence in the adequacy of the balance sheet. As it relates to stop loss, you're right, we're seeing nice growth in that product line. We've got 13% year-on-year premium growth. We're on track to achieve our target profitability in that business this year. So nice performance, and it continues to resonate with our clients. David, anything you want to add in that regard? Good morning, Lisa. It's Brian. I'll start. I think that's a multiparter, and then Eric is going to chime in with some comments on the sales season. But as it relates to the quarter, overall, Evernorth continues to perform really well. So, I'd start there. Largely in line with our expectations when you put all the different moving pieces together. The individual components you kind of called out there, Eric referenced earlier, GLP-1 utilization does continue to build, which in the Evernorth business is a positive contributor to our earnings at this point in time, whether that be for diabetic indications or non-diabetic indications. So that's certainly a net positive relative to the Evernorth business in 2023. On the biosimilar side of the house, you should think of, thus far, relatively low adoption of Amjevita in the first half of the year. On the second half of the year, we obviously added two additional biosimilars into the National Preferred Formulary. And one of the reasons we expect acceleration in income growth in the third and fourth quarter is the impact of greater biosimilar adoption as well as improved overall positioning relative to the dynamics of competitiveness across the four drugs that will be on the National Preferred Formulary. But in the second quarter, I wouldn't characterize biosimilars as a particular driver of the margin profile. On the Centene impact, we remain very much on track relative to the implementation against our commitments. As we mentioned before, we expect to spend about $200 million over the course of 2023. You should think of that as gradually building quarter-to-quarter over the course of the year. And so, the money is being spent as we speak. And all those factors did impact the second quarter. But again, nothing in particular I would call out being significantly deviating from our expectations compared to what we expected three months ago. Eric, maybe you can pick up both on Centene and the selling season. Good morning, Kevin. It's Brian. So, I'll start, and I think your question is specific to Cigna Healthcare, which is where I'll go. So, first off, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare book. If you look at our year-to-date customer growth, it's running ahead of expectations at $1.5 million net growth, and that builds off of a strong performance we had in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As it relates to our refreshed membership outlook for the year, you can think of the primary driver of that being an elevated expectation for individual exchange customers by year-end 2023. The other components of the Cigna Healthcare customer outlook are broadly unchanged from our prior projections. We're not yet seeing meaningful signs of any economic pressure within our commercial book of business. But that said, we have assumed some elevated disenrollment in the U.S. commercial business in the second half of 2023 in order to be prudent. We continue to exclude any potential Medicaid redetermination lives from our commercial forecast for the balance of the year. And taken all together, again, pleased to see a full year outlook of 8% growth in total medical customers across Cigna Healthcare. One minor refinement we made this year or this quarter relative to the individual exchange business is, we are now forecasting some level of Medicaid redeterminations coming in through the balance of the year. So, you should think of the commercial business, excluding Medicaid redetermination, the individual forecast now including some level of redeterminations for the balance of the year. Good morning, Josh. It's Brian. So, I'll take the first one, and then David will pick up on the Medicare Advantage question. So, as it relates to the different payable dynamics, let me try to give you the full picture here. So, just for some context, we ended the quarter with about 820,000 customers in the individual exchange business. That was up significantly from where we were at the end of 2022. And during the 2022 year, we were in a risk adjustment receivable position on this business. So, when we stepped into '23, we had been anticipating that, that would switch over and that will -- we'd be in a payable position for 2023. The first look we got at the industry-wide risk adjustment data that we received in early July indicated that we'll be in an even greater payable position for the 2023 plan year, and that was driven by two large states. Those two large states represent about half of the individual exchange premium base. And the adjustment in the first half of the year that came through the second quarter was an $80 million increase in the payable. That was offset largely by a favorable true-up on the 2022 receivable. You can think of that in the range of about $50 million. And then the residual is primarily driven by favorable claim costs in 2023 relative to our expectations. So that favorability in the 2023 claim costs partially offset the increased payable that we have -- that ran through the second quarter. So hopefully, that helps to square the picture a little bit on the individual exchange business. David, do you want to pick up on MA? Good morning, Nathan. It's Brian. So, as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare seasonality, I'd start -- just to remind you, we expect the second half earnings to be a little bit less than 55% in the third quarter. Relative to the MCR component of that, our prior expectations on the MCR seasonality have not changed. So, what I mean by that is the directional pattern we saw, for example, in 2022 on MCR is a reasonable proxy for what we'd expect the 2023 quarterly pattern to be, and as a result, the fourth quarter MCR is likely to be the highest quarter of the year as we see more customers meet their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum obligations. However, we do expect the pace of SG&A spending to look different than it did last year. For example, we had a step up in SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we would not expect to recur in the fourth quarter of '23. The other item that I call your attention to is our net investment income in the fourth quarter of '22 was considerably weaker than what we're expecting to see in the fourth quarter of '23. So, those are the primary things to think through as it relates to the seasonality pattern. As it relates to '24. At this point in time, there's nothing I'd call your attention to that will lead us to think there's any abnormal pattern. Good morning, Steve. It's Brian. So, as you noted, we planned and priced for more normalized utilization levels in 2023, and our claims experience is largely consistent with that expectation. So, within the MA book specifically to the core of your question, we have seen elevated utilization of both outpatient and professional services all year. But important this should be viewed in the context of what we had forecasted and priced for. So, the overall cost trends are largely in line with our expectations in both our second half 2023 guidance and our 2024 bids. Anticipate that, that dynamic will continue, as it relates to specifically within outpatient and professional surgeries are the area that I'd call your attention to, in particular, orthopedic and cardiovascular, we did see some level of favorability in inpatients. So those are a few of the subcategories that I'd call your attention to, but all in line with what we had anticipated coming into the year. Hey, Steve, it's Brian. So, a few things I'd call your attention to in regards to the profitability margins relative to revenue. We had an expansion of our relationship with the Department of Defense that was effective on January 1, and we had some additional spending that we're kind of working our way into in terms of growing into that. So that certainly weighed down the income growth a bit in the first half of the year. To your point, the rate and pace of investments, particularly around the accelerated growth businesses in Evernorth, both the healthcare services as well as the Accredo specialty pharmacy also impacted the income growth. And then for the back half of the year, we expect accelerated income growth, again, mid-single digits in the third quarter, mid- to high-single digits in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the increased ramp for biosimilars. And I would note that, that's not predicated on any meaningful share shift. We have strong visibility to that income emerging in the back half of the year. Good morning, George. It's Brian. I'll start and then Eric can pick up a bit. So yes, the fees and other revenue in Evernorth is a strong driver of growth, granted off of a low base. So, important to keep that in mind as you think about the overall P&L. Multiple areas of growth underneath this line. One I'd call out is we're seeing increased demand for PBM service-based solutions, meaning more fee-oriented relationships as we have more and more clients looking for those types of mechanisms. We also have contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses reflected here. So, for example, MDLive and eviCore are both contributing to that. And then if you're looking at pharmacy other revenue, the CuraScript Specialty Distribution business has been a strong grower year-on-year. You also recall from some of our prior conversations that we're very focused on driving cross-enterprise leverage between the Cigna Healthcare business and Evernorth. So, as Cigna Healthcare procures more and more services from Evernorth, we have some benefit that comes through the fees and the other revenue lines in Evernorth from that as well. So, Eric, anything you want to add in terms of further color? Good morning, Lance. It's Brian. I'll start, and then David, if you want to chime in with anything, feel free. So, for a long period of time, as I think you know, our specialty products within Cigna Healthcare been a really core part of the value proposition as we seek to expand client relationships. So, we have few clients that only purchase medical services from us more and more purchase a full suite because we've demonstrated over time our clinical models perform best when we have a fuller suite of services. As it relates to what we're seeing in terms of trends in terms of utilization, behavioral health has certainly been growing at a strong clip, not just this year, but for the past few years. Part of that is by design as we engage with our customers. And over time, that's a good thing because the more utilization we see in behavioral health services, it helps to defray core medical costs over time. We've also seen an uptick in dental utilization this year as well, but all of these things are within, again, the boundaries of what we had forecasted and planned for and priced for within our Cigna Healthcare book of business, which is why you're seeing our commercial employer business continue to perform so well financially. And again, that line is on track to achieve target margins here in 2023. David, anything you want to pick up on here?"

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. For the second quarter, again, we delivered a strong performance, fueled by continued growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses. Today, I will review key strategic drivers contributing to our momentum and why we believe we are well-positioned to sustain our growth as we continue to support the health and vitality of those we serve with our differentiated solutions and capabilities. Brian will cover additional details about our financial performance in the quarter and our 2023 outlook. As part of our ongoing effort for you to hear more from members of our leadership team Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services, will be joining our call and is available to take your questions. With that, let's get started. In the second quarter, we delivered total revenues of $48.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $6.13 and cash flow from operations of $2.5 billion. We are pleased with our performance overall during the quarter and through the first half of the year. With focus on affordability and innovation, we are continuing to strengthen our competitive position and grow our businesses. In Evernorth Health Services, we saw another strong quarter of our market-leading pharmacy, care and benefits portfolio. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefits business, harnesses our deep relationships, extensive clinical expertise and is delivering innovations and innovative solutions for those we serve. We've long been a leader in supporting access to prescription drugs and, to further enhance our efforts, we took a series of actions in the quarter, including launching Copay Assurance to support further affordability for patients, and ClearCareRX to provide our clients with broader choice. We also introduced [Independent Rx] (ph), which is a first-of-its-kind support program for rural pharmacists that recognizes the critical role they play in improving access for millions of Americans. We will continue to lead the way through the current environment of elevated legislative and regulatory activity and we are encouraged by the positive recognition of our work to make safe, effective and affordable access of prescription drugs within reach for millions of people who need them. Our client retention is also strong, and we are continuing to build and expand new relationships. For example, we are making good progress for implementation with Centene, which begins on January of 2024. Our teams are working collaboratively and we are on track as we prepare to further improve affordability in serving 20 million Centene customers. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Accredo, our specialty pharmacy business. In a moment, I'll profile the deep clinical expertise and capabilities that make Accredo a differentiated leader in this space. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, we delivered another quarter of organic customer growth, reinforcing how well our consultative approach and capabilities continue to resonate in the market. Our U.S. commercial business continues to build momentum. We've had sustained success with commercial customer growth outpacing the overall market and 2023 is shaping up to be another very strong year for this business. With our affordability initiatives and deep consultative sales approach, we are delivering highly competitive total cost of care for employer clients, as well as providing programs supporting healthy engaged workforces that they need. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above-market customer growth with high-quality affordable plans and targeted investments that we continue to make to further strengthen our network and offerings. In our individual exchange business, we will continue taking a focused approach by engaging customers to improve health outcomes and managing risks in the expanding population we serve. In the quarter, while our medical care ratio was generally in line with expectations, we did have an increase to our 2023 risk adjustment payable. Relative to the risk [adjuster] (ph) impact, we expect this to be a 2023 event, and we've already taken actions for 2024. And in our international health business, we drove continued innovation and growth in target markets with solutions for the [globally mobile] (ph) population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Overall, our second quarter results showed that The Cigna Group is performing well with underlying strength in our complementary businesses. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our company and delivering on our commitments. With the strength of our results, we are increasing our outlook for full year revenue and customer growth, as well as cash flow from operations, and we are reaffirming that we are on track to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023. Now, I will talk about how we are working to sustain our momentum with our differentiated and diversified capabilities and our durable strategic growth framework. Our framework guides us in continuing to respond to customer, patient and client needs, as well as capturing growth opportunities within our foundational businesses and our accelerated growth businesses. Additionally, we harness the power of our talent, client relationships and partnerships, as well as an expanding technology portfolio for cross-enterprise leverage. Technology increasingly provides us with opportunities to accelerate innovation and growth. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, are capabilities further enhancing ways for us to support patients and their clinical care teams, as well as drive additional efficiency initiatives. Today, I'll talk more about one of our accelerated growth businesses, Accredo, our flagship specialty pharmacy, where we have a competitive advantage in an area of growing needs and opportunity. Earlier this summer, we welcomed a group of investors to Warrendale, Pennsylvania at one of our Accredo clinical care sites. The visit provided an opportunity to see the breadth of our specialty capabilities and the depth of our clinical expertise, a critical driver for the positive outcomes and impact we achieve for patients requiring complex and high-cost treatments for chronic conditions. Here are a few headlines from the day at Warrendale. First, Accredo has a proven track record of growth. Nearly five years ago when Express Scripts combined with Cigna, Accredo was approximately a $30 billion business. Today, Accredo has grown to approximately $60 billion. And in 2023, serves approximately 900,000 patients with some of the most complex conditions and needs. Accredo now represents about 40% of Evernorth's total revenue, and because of its unique strengths, Accredo has grown faster than the overall marketplace. Second, these secular tailwinds in the market create significant growth opportunities as we look to the future. Those who need specialty drugs make up about 5% of the population and they drive more than 40% of total healthcare costs across medical, behavioral and pharmacy services. This is fueling expected mid to high single-digit annual growth in what is already a specialty pharmaceutical market of approximately $380 billion. Biosimilars represent force of change and a substantial opportunity for further growth and impact, and we will leverage them for greater affordability for clients and patients. We've long been a leader in supporting greater adoption of biosimilars as we did with the wave of generic medications when they became available decades ago. And like generics, we believe biosimilars will drive much-needed affordability improvements for those we serve and thereby create more financial capacity to pay for new pharmaceutical innovations today and as we look to the future. Third is the breadth of our clinical capabilities and use of data that further fuels precision and impact. We built and strengthened our clinical capabilities and far-reaching operating model over decades. Within Accredo, we have therapeutic resource centers with clinical teams of pharmacists, nurses, dietitians and social workers specializing in different disease states, such as blood and neurological disorders and multiple types of cancers. Unlike many of our competitors, we directly employ hundreds of field-based infusion nurses. Today, they are located within 75 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population. And as they care for patients inside their homes, they provide better, more coordinated and personalized experiences, including addressing social determinants of health. With the clinical care model focused on each individual patient, we are able to provide a level of personalized clinical support that is vital in specialty pharmacy. Many new high-cost drugs for oncology, gene therapies and rare conditions are coming to market, further pressuring affordability for clients and requiring greater support for patients that take these complex medications safely and effectively. I would note, drug manufacturers also recognize our expertise and capabilities, as well as our superior outcomes that we produce with our unique, coordinated clinical model. Putting all this together, we are excited about the accelerated growth opportunities we have with Accredo's differentiated specialty pharmacy, and view it as a powerful growth engine for our company today and into the future. Now, stepping back to the enterprise level, I'll briefly recap. We drove strong earnings that built on our momentum from the first quarter and last year. We delivered adjusted EPS of $6.13, strong customer, revenue and cash flow growth. Our progress gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance of adjusted EPS of at least $24.70 for full year 2023, and we also remain on track for adjusted EPS of at least $28.00 in 2024. This reinforces how we are creating value for our customers and clients and leveraging differentiated capabilities to give us flexibility to continue performing well in a dynamic environment. Now, Brian will share additional perspective about our performance in the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Brian? A.J., good morning. It's David. Let me describe a little bit of the -- we'll say the buying characteristics and areas of focus in the market more broadly, and then I'll ask Eric to give you a little bit more color in terms of the pharmacy specific space and using your GLP-1 as an example. So, stepping back, and it's for the latter part of your comment to reinforce it, the buying behaviors continue to have an intense focus on, what I will call, base buying needs focused on affordability, coupled with consistent high-quality service levels. There's two additional dimensions, I would say, that have intensified recently relative to need state. One, as employers, because you're coming at through the employee lens, continue to intensify their focus on having healthy, engaged, highly-productive workforce. They're intensifying their focus and need and awareness of the complex behavioral health needs from their population, inclusive of, but also beyond the more intense behavioral health dimensions. This includes anxiety, stress, depression and complexity to come along with that. Here, I would note that within our Cigna Group portfolio of solutions, we're well positioned to meet the needs, because there's a lot of coordination that's necessary to advance there. The second trend I'd highlight is what the marketplace is sometimes calling point solution fatigue, where over time, employers have aggregated many individual point solutions that made sense at a given moment in time, but they find themselves stepping back and looking at that inventory, questioning whether or not either, a, they're getting all the value out of each individual solution, or b, the friction and/or abrasion for their coworkers or medical professionals is worth the value of the fractured point solutions, and therefore, are challenging more opportunities to coordinate or integrate solutions to get more value, leverage and better service from that standpoint. And again, our portfolio is really well positioned there and continues to resonate in the market as evidenced by our growth. I'll ask Eric to provide a little bit of color of areas of focus for buyers more broadly in pharmacy, including the GLP-1. Yes. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Justin. The item I amplify is, Justin, as you recall from prior conversations, part of our consultative approach and go-to-market approach is when you work with clients of a variety of sizes around the benefit design that matches their strategy, the clinical programs in support of that, that match your strategy, the service support programs that match your strategy. The final thing we work on is the funding mechanism. And as the market conditions change, we have the ability to flex between risk or guarantee cost, shared returns and/or self-funded with stop loss. And our stop loss program, as you call out, continues to perform well, grow well and resonate in the marketplace because it provides that peace of mind and predictability for employers around their cash flow and any dislocation that may happen in a given year. So, our specialists in that space have a high-performing book. It continues to resonate well. And you'll see ebb and flow over time based on market buying conditions, but continued growth. Sure, Brian, thanks. Good morning, Josh. So, you had two questions. Specific to MA and our bid strategy, I'll just speak more broadly. I'm not going to go into detail specifically, Josh, just to manage expectations given the time cycle and the competitive nature. First and foremost, as I noted, we're pleased with our growth in 2023, point one. Two, as we look to 2024 to some of the points you made reference to, we expect to see larger-than-average local market variability in terms of offering and positioning by competitors. And at this point, I would highlight and reinforce that we remain convicted to and comfortable with our bid assumptions relative to underlying medical costs based upon what we've seen through the first two quarters of the year and our outlook for the year. I'd also note that our [stars] (ph) position coming into the cycle is consistent and strong and our early look at the stars on a go-forward basis remains consistent and strong from that standpoint. Specifically to your last point around Village, first and foremost, I'd ask you to think about initiating the relationship with Village, we seek to have a long-term strategic positive impact. I would note that day one for the benefit of our customers who are experiencing Village and Summit relationships, they began to see benefits immediately by the nature of the structure of our relationship. And then, we continue to collaborate, innovate on value-based care, whether it's leveraging some Evernorth capabilities like behavioral, virtual or other services, and/or go more deeply into individual markets around more precisely leveraging data and insights to curate sub-specialty networks to get the best possible quality and cost and affordability. That benefit will continue to mount as we go forward, and to the core of your question, contribute to market by market, our posture in MA. But specifically, we're driving this initiative with Village and with our Evernorth team to benefit our commercial space as well. So, we're pleased with the early traction, a lot of work to do, and it will continue to yield dividends both today and into the future. Thanks, Josh. Sure, Brian. Thanks. Good morning, Lance. A few items to highlight, specifically, just click down a little more notch, in behavioral, as Brian noted, elevated trend and as you would expect, and over a prolonged period of time, I think the last three to five years, as you click down in it, think about the professional services as such, we continue to innovate new products, new programs, expansion of network, both physical network, we operate the largest virtual behavioral network in America today, and then expanding behavioral services even further in our value-based care programs to help medical professionals be a first line of screening and support from that standpoint. To the last part of your question around the expansion opportunities within our portfolio, you know our portfolio well in terms of the healthcare side of the equation. If you think about the old monikers of Select, I think under 500 employees, middle market, 500 to 5,000 old monikers, and Nashville above 5,000, multi-geographic. Select, you still think about that as totally cross-sold and penetrated. We go to market with bundled solutions. It's a big part of our value proposition. Helps us generate a predictable high quality, low trend and outcome. Middle market remains and has a high level of penetration, yet there are cross-sell opportunities. And national accounts, a lower level of penetration versus the other segments. However, as I noted to A.J.'s question, the point solution fatigue in the marketplace presents it even further opportunity as you coordinate those services. The last note I would make is as we leverage the breadth of the Evernorth capabilities today and into the future, we're innovating new solutions. So, you'll hear us talk more about [path wall] (ph) programs to take specific diagnoses and look at reengineering those episodes of care end-to-end. And in cases to your phraseology, we take risk based on the performance, we hold ourself accountable based upon the clinical service and financial outcomes. So, strong penetration down market, opportunities upmarket, market buying behavior is evolving because of point solution fatigue, and importantly, continued innovation will continue to drive growth for us there. Thanks, Lance. Thank you for your engagement and questions today. I just want to highlight a few items. We stepped into 2023 with strong growth and have been successful in building beyond that momentum throughout the first half of the year. We remain confident that we'll deliver on our commitments, including our adjusted EPS outlook for 2023 of at least $24.70 and our commitment for at least $28.00 of EPS in 2024. I'd also know how proud and appreciative I am of our colleagues around the world who continue to be dedicated to driving innovation and delivering on the programs and solutions, as well as partnerships that support every day the health and vitality of our customers, our patients and our clients. As always, we look forward to talking to you again soon about how we're working to sustain the growth of our company and capture more opportunities to serve more lives and achieve a greater impact, and we continue to invest in our future every day to drive further innovation. Have a great day."

            "name": "Eric Palmer",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, David. Good morning, A.J. I'll start with the GLP-1. GLP-1s are definitely top of mind for many of our clients. There's been a meaningful uptick in utilization here. And as I think you know, we have coverage for these medications on our formularies from early on for value-based arrangements with pharma manufacturers. We've seen contributions for the benefit of patients and our clients by result of those -- the structures. We have recently launched a program called ENCIRCLERX, which brings together management of the GLP-1, cardiac, diabetic conditions, obesity. So these conditions often tend to be interrelated, to bring together a benefit plan design, the clinical support as necessary and the overall resources we can bring to help these patients, better manage their health and ultimately get to a better plan costs. So, at GLP-1 and the broader cardiac, obesity, diabetes space is a real area of focus. I would also note, as David touched on in his comments, continued interest in behavioral solutions. That's an area that we've got strong expertise within Evernorth, and we're excited about the opportunities in that market and the need to help manage behavioral care more effectively. Those will probably be the top couple of specific themes I would call out at this point, A.J. Great. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Lisa. So, just a couple of other comments that I had on Centene. I'm really pleased with how we are working together to deliver an implementation program to serve Centene's customers. We are on track, and there's good momentum in the readiness for our January '24 implementation. So, continue to be excited about that opportunity. With respect to the selling season more broadly, we operate in a competitive market, and the strength of our solutions really continues to resonate. We will deliver another strong retention rate. As we look to the 2024, I think mid-90%-s or higher, and consistent with our prior commentary around what a strong retention rate looks like. We'll have additional new growth, new client wins on top of the large Centene win as well. So, feeling good as we kind of wind down the 2024 selling season at this point, and we'll provide more detail on that when we provide our 2024 guidance later on. Good morning, Nathan. It's Eric. I'll start. So, as you noted and implied in your question, biosimilars are a really important opportunity to drive competition and for us to then help to make that competition efficient to drive improvements to the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. Now, in 2023, we've continued to co-prefer Humira on the formulary. Towards the beginning of the year, we added Amjevita to our National Preferred Formulary and recently added Cyltezo and Sandoz's products, both the low and high [indiscernible] versions onto the NPF. So that's the activity that's gotten us to this point to date. I would note, we work through with the manufacturers on the terms of those to drive to the best available cost, the best available expense for our clients. And we have visibility into that pretty early on. So, we've navigated and made our arrangements in constructing the placement such as we came into this year. And so, I wouldn't want you to think about there being dynamics kind of playing out simultaneously. These are things we have negotiated in advance. We have visibility into as the products come into the market and we work to leverage the competition to continue to improve affordability for the benefit of the clients we serve. Over time, as we drive even more products, more competition, we'll work to continue to bring improved levels of affordability to our clients and continue to construct our offerings in a way that best meet their needs. I hand it over to Brian on the second part of your question. Brian, thanks. You've hit the headlines in terms of the main drivers here financially. Well, just to note, on the fee-based portion of the PBM in particular, this is an area that we've continued to accelerate. David made reference in his prepared remarks around our ClearCareRx program. This builds off of a couple of years of experience that we've got in providing fee-based fully-aligned mechanisms in terms of providing the pharmacy benefit, and so those fee types of arrangements will come through there. I would say, have you think about the margin profile for that business is very consistent with the other businesses in Express Scripts and the like. And then likewise, the growth in our MDLive and behavioral platforms continue to be an area of real focus for us and continued momentum into that driver as well. And I would have you think about those margins is also generally in line with the Evernorth segment overall. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity and the momentum that we're building in all of the different lines across the Evernorth portfolio, and you're seeing the growth there come through that line."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedures on how to enter queue to ask questions at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the conference over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, The Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our first quarter financial results and our updated financial outlook for 2023. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income, and total revenues respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of thecignagroup.com.  We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2023 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note in today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results effective January 01, 2023 we adopted, amended accounting guidance for long duration insurance contracts, LDTI, and related amendments, our 2023 full year outlook included the impact of LDTI and prior results have been restated to reflect this change. There has been no material impact to prior results and this change will not materially impact our future operating results. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance including our full year 2023 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2023 dividends. With that I will call -- turn the call over to David. \nDavid Cordani: Thanks Ralph. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining today\u2019s call. We begin 2023 with momentum and in the first quarter we again delivered strong performance and continued our long track record of innovating for customers, clients, and partners. Today I will discuss some of the key drivers fueling our growth during the quarter and we also talk about how we are leading the way to address evolving state health care needs with a flexible financial model providing multiple avenues to deliver and capture revenue. Specifically, I will describe how the durable and flexible pharmacy benefit services we harbor continue to drive in the marketplace. Finally, we will provide additional details about our financial results and discuss our outlook for 2023 and then we will take your questions. With that let\u2019s get started.  In the first quarter we delivered $46.5 billion in total revenues, $5.41 in adjusted earnings per share, and we are ranging our full year 2023 guidance for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth. We are pleased with the strong start across Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare and we look forward -- as we look forward, we expect another very good year for the Cigna Group. Evernorth comprising pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy, and Evernorth Care again contributed strong growth while retaining, expanding and winning new relationships for the employers, health plans, and governmental organizations we serve. Our foundational pharmacy benefit service business continued the strong performance demonstrating the value we provide to our clients and patients.  Specialty pharmacy which accounts for approximately 40% of Evernorth's total revenue drove outside its growth with a continued rise in new to market specialty drugs and increasing demand. Evernorth Care represents one of our most significant long-term growth opportunities given the growing needs a virtual care as well as for example behavioral health services. Insignia Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of revenue and customer growth with strong performance across our U.S. commercial, U.S. government, and international health businesses. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with their medical cost performance and our medical care ratio which was 81.3%. Our U.S. commercial business is on pace for another good year. Our affordability initiatives continue to strengthen our overall competitive position and this has helped fuel our strong customer growth. Our momentum also is a reflection of how employers of all sizes rely upon our consultative approach and the breadth of our solutions to support the health, engagement, and productivity of their workforces. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above market growth in 2023 from a high quality and affordable plans, our geographic expansion, and the maturation of markets we previously expanded into. In a dynamic individual exchange market we also have substantial growth in our individual and family plan business, allowing us to bring Cigna Healthcare capabilities to a larger customer base. And in International Health, our earnings growth has been strong for the past few years and we expect positive top line and bottom line contributions again in 2023 given our high quality and localized health insurance solutions supported by our global provider network.  Overall, we're pleased with the quality, strength, and resilience demonstrated in our results and importantly, how they position us for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation. Looking ahead, we are confident in our increased outlook for the year as well as our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 13% compounded EPS growth over our strategic horizon along with providing an attractive dividend.  Today, I want to spend a few minutes on Express Risk, our pharmacy benefits business within Evernorth, including our recent announcements about how we are continuing to provide greater affordability, choice, and transparency for our clients and customers. Pharmacy services have an essential and impactful role in a time when in medical care, physical or behavioral are increasingly relying upon the use of pharmaceutical interventions. It's also important to recognize that successful care coordination programs for pharmacy services often create significant benefit and value for the medical services. We recognize the ongoing attention and legislative debate regarding the rising costs of prescription drugs. We are taking an active leadership role and I want to be clear about how we are using our differentiated capabilities to create and capture value out of the drug supply chain on behalf of our clients and customers.  First is the strength of our model, which is to deliver solutions and care coordination that address specific client needs and expand relationships with our full suite of services and capabilities, fueling our sustained attractive growth over time. Second, we are committed to enabling and prioritizing choice for our clients as we drive down costs. And third, we continue to build on our long track record of innovation to drive greater affordability, access, transparency and improved clinical outcomes. Stepping back, our Pharmacy Benefit Service business is achieving attractive growth because we're able to secure a diverse group of any growing client base, leading with the strength of our supply chain, clinical and care management programs. With our proven model Express Groups client retention rates are consistently in the mid-90s or higher and we've been able to continuously grow our pipeline and win new business, from medium size to the largest employers, from the local health plans to national players, and even the largest government sponsored programs.  We've expanded our efforts to advocate on behalf of our clients and customers particularly as it relates to financing models which are key areas of focus for some of the current legislative proposals. The Express Scripts business model starts with the commitment to enabling and prioritizing choice in benefit design and financing options for clients who are the primary financers of their employee benefit programs. This includes providing them the option to finance the cost of their programs by allowing us to share in the discounts we secure on their behalf, be it rebates or spread pricing. Our clients choose amongst these models based upon their needs for managing risk and greater predictability for the pharmacy costs as well as their cash flow.  For context, across the breadth of our Express Scripts Pharmacy Benefit Service portfolio today over 95% of rebate dollars are passed through to clients. The key point is that each client chooses the financing mechanism that works best for them. They have choices in how they pay for the value we deliver and many find that using rebate sharing or spread pricing generates a stronger level of alignment incentives in addition to being able to plan for predictable cash flow that it generates. Proposes to limit the availability and scope of these options will result in less choice for thousands of employers, health plans and government, the clients we serve and increase their costs over time. As it relates to Express Scripts, we are confident in our ability to earn sustainable and attractive margins for our services under a variety of legislative scenarios. We are able to create value through the breadth of our capabilities from supply chain to benefit design, driving competition amongst drug manufacturers to bring costs down, and deliver better health outcomes through our clinical programs. One area of focus for multiple stakeholders has been the amount of income we earn from rebate retention and retail spread. To put this in context, we expect about 20% of Evernorth's 2023 pretax adjusted earnings to come from Express Scripts retention of rebates and retail spread. This percentage has trended down over time and we expect it to continue trending downward. This is fueled by our ongoing innovation and greater diversification of our Evernorth businesses. I would also remind you that these financing options that we provide the clients are developed in exchange for lower service fees. So said otherwise if these programs decrease further overtime fee based income would increase. Therefore, we are confident that if some of these payment vehicles were reduced or removed by regulatory change or client preference, Express Scripts has a broad set of capabilities that create value and will continue to earn an attractive return.  Let me provide some specific examples that reinforce our flexibility and durable model and how we tap into our long track record of innovation for better outcomes on behalf of our customers and clients who are seeking greater affordability and transparency for prescription drugs. First, we're taking several steps to expand transparency. Express Scripts new ClearCareRX fully demonstrates the flexibility we have for prescription drug benefits where clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for prescriptions. They receive 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtained by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. They pay one service fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, product services, reporting analytics and the program is supported by a fully audible mechanism. In addition, clients also benefit from guarantees to keep Express Scripts accountable for clinical and financial performance measures, including improvements in overall inheritance rates and patient outcomes. Additional steps to drive even greater transparency include providing clients with enhanced financial and feed disclosures regarding their spread pricing programs when they exist. Along with today's release about our first quarter financial results, you will also find additional disclosures we are providing about Express Scripts model in our quarterly regulatory filings and on our new microsite. We will also offer a new digital pharmacy benefits statement for customers starting in 2024. The statement will share drug pricing information, out of pocket costs and the net value delivered by Express Scripts on behalf of customers. With respect to the broader issue of drug pricing, to be clear, we were fully aligned with lowering costs of prescription drugs for customers. For example, Express Scripts Patient Assurance program launched in 2019 capped out of market costs for eligible members of select diabetes and cardiovascular medications. In 2022 alone, customers taking insulin saved more than $18 million because of this program. Now with the introduction of our new copay assurance plan, we are taking further action to cap out our pocket costs for customers in client prescription drug benefits at $5 for generic drugs, $25 for preferred brand medications, and $45 for preferred specialty medications. Finally, we also have a series of groundbreaking initiatives to further support pharmacists in rural communities across the United States. We are offering increased reimbursement to true independent pharmacists and partnering in opportunities to expand their clinical practices to further support care needs of the local communities. We are also convening an advisory committee of community pharmacists. These initiatives will encourage better care, expanded access to lower prices for rural Americans, as well as increasing a more sustainable revenue stream for independent pharmacists. We are encouraged by how our recent actions have been received by a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, our pharmacy network partners and policymakers. They recognize our commitment as a leader and trusted partner that could use to create value through our deep expertise in designing programs for specific client needs, driving innovation, and broadening our reach. In summary, we are demonstrating our leadership in the competitive pharmacy benefits market that is such a critical building block for the American healthcare system. We are serving specific client needs through the strength of our model and the effectiveness of our care coordination programs, allowing us to drive sustained attractive growth. We are continuing to advocate for clients and their ability to choose the appropriateness of programs that work best for the business as we help to lower costs. And we are continuing to innovate in driving greater affordability, transparency, and improved outcomes for those we serve.  Now let me briefly recap our performance for the quarter and our outlook. In the first quarter, we continue to execute and perform well. We delivered for our customers, clients and partners and our business kept our commitment to our shareholders. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.41 per share and we're pleased to have increased our full year outlook or adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth as well as an improved medical care ratio. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver and capture value in the dynamic and changing environment. We've shaped our business model to navigate varying economic conditions and our differentiated capabilities within Evernorth to provide us with the flexibility to meet unique client needs and potential changes caused by regulatory requirements. Additionally, our business is driving growth that is generating strong cash flows and we are confident that we will further create value for successful and effective capital deployment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's first quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. The first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations, demonstrating focused execution across our high performing Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 6% to $46.5 billion, after tax adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, and cash flow from operations of $5 billion. This performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.70 per share.  Before I discuss our Evernorth results, I'll build on David's comments regarding our recent announcement to advance transparency around our PBM and I'll provide incremental details on our earnings drivers. I'd first start with a level setting that of our operating platforms ever takes up approximately 60% of earnings and Cigna Healthcare is about 40%. Within Evernorth, our Express Scripts PBM is a foundational asset with a diverse set of earnings sources including service and administrative fees, clinical programs, and value based care arrangements along with retained rebates and retail spread. These earnings sources are a function of the choices made by our clients. As David referenced, approximately 20% of Evernorth's adjusted pretax earnings are comprised of PBM retained rebates and retail spread. This percentage has decreased over time as we continue to expand fee based client relationships and as our Evernorth portfolio becomes more diverse and continues to grow. Importantly, as Evernorth's business mix has changed over the years, margins have remained stable. This speaks to our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate disruption in the operating or regulatory environment. As David mentioned and I would underscore, our foundational PBM asset will continue to create and deliver significant value, which will allow us to sustain growth at attractive competitive returns.  Shifting to our current period Evernorth results, first quarter 2023 revenues grew 8% to $36.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, in line with our expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, providing an additional avenue for growth as we further deepen our relationships across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We also continue to make strategic investments, which serve to strengthen and grow our client relationships, expand our portfolio of products and services, and advance our digital capabilities. As it relates to our strategic partnerships, we remain on track in our implementation of the Centene contract that begins in 2024. And our collaboration with VillageMD is progressing and provides us an attractive opportunity to further accelerate our value-based care programs and capabilities. We will continue to expand these value-based solutions for the benefit of our Cigna Healthcare, U.S. commercial and U.S. government clients as well as other provider partners and Evernorth health plan clients.  Additionally, we remain confident around the multiyear accelerating biosimilar opportunity with high visibility into expected savings for customers and clients in the second half of this year, consistent with our prior expectations and regardless of utilization shifts for product approvals in the market. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well. Our diversified set of earnings streams, along with flexible financing models enable us to innovate and adapt through dynamic environments. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, first quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion, slightly above our expectations. The medical care ratio of 81.3% was better than expectations as overall utilization came in slightly favorable. This was reinforced by our clinical engagement models and related affordability initiatives as well as our continued pricing discipline. Turning to medical customers, we ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers since the end of 2022. This strong growth demonstrates the continued differentiation of our market-leading products and services. Our commercial customers increased 8% year-to-date aided by the addition of a large fee-based health plan client that expands upon an existing Evernorth relationship. And even excluding this client win, we drove organic customer growth across all of our U.S. commercial market segments. In our U.S. government business, we saw considerable growth in our U.S. Individual and Medicare Advantage customers, with MA growth of 10% on a year-to-date basis. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2023 as we continue to deliver differentiated value and affordability to our customers and clients. Across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we delivered strong first quarter financial results driven by our diversified portfolio of foundational and accelerated growth businesses, further bolstered by cross enterprise leverage. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $188 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening customer relationships in Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $24.70 per share. Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect earnings this year to be back half weighted in large part driven by Evernorth's earnings ramp over the course of the year with second half EPS contributing slightly below 55% of full year EPS. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance, all while investing in growth and innovation. We continue to expect Evernorth full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.3 million customers, an increase of 100,000 lives. We are improving our 2023 medical care ratio outlook to a range of 81.5% to 82.3% and we are raising our expected full year 2023 adjusted earnings to at least $4.425 billion. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have yet to see material impact to Cigna Healthcare enrollment levels. We remain prudent with respect to our enrollment outlook for the rest of the year as evidenced by our full year guidance relative to the first quarter customer growth results. To be clear, we continue to expect underlying organic employer client growth as we move through the year. And our outlook continues to assume some elevated disenrollment in the second half of the year corresponding with some expected softening in the economy. Additionally, as a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate incremental customer growth from Medicaid redeterminations. Finally, when contemplating the Cigna Group's performance under various future economic scenarios, it's important to keep in mind that we have strategically positioned the company's portfolio of businesses to be more diversified than it was in prior economic downturns. This gives us confidence and resilience to weather dynamic macroeconomic environments.  Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 42.2% as of March 31st. We expect to lower this ratio over the balance of the year, and we continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Year-to-date through May 4, 2023 we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. And for full year 2023, we continue to expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. First quarter results were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses. Evernorth continued to deliver strong results with the first quarter in line with our expectations. While Cigna Healthcare had a strong start to the year, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 EPS guidance of at least $24.70. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And over the long run, we continue to expect average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and are confident in our ability to adapt and navigate the operating and regulatory backdrop with our diversified business mix, and complementary capabilities across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ms. Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question. \nLisa Gill: Thanks very much, good morning. David, thank you for all the comments around the PBM and profitability, etcetera. I guess my first question is really to understand where do you think the disconnect is from a legislative standpoint versus how the PBMs actually operate? And then secondly, when we think about an employer, it feels to me that a lot of this legislation is going to take away that decision-making by the employer, what are employers saying to you around legislation, what are they saying to you around the selling season, and then also if you can just give us an update as to how you're thinking about the 2024 selling season?\nDavid Cordani: Lisa, you put a lot in there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Let me try to touch on each. First, as we step back, as I noted, we're quite proud of the results that we have delivered and continue to deliver in view of the PBMs using that acronym, but the pharmacy service organizations are the organizations that relentlessly work to improve affordability for the benefit of a broad constituency group. I think to your first question, if we step back, well, we could point to tremendous results in terms of clinical trends, outcome, affordability on average, less than $1 increase in out-of-pocket costs for individuals. We do recognize, and I think this is part of the legislation or the legislative energy, the program still don't work for everyone.  So for example, while the programs are designed to generate overall affordability, if there's a high deductible plan is an illustration and in the month of January, someone has -- it is a deductible and has a significant out-of-pocket for our pharmaceutical experience that creates a financial dislocation for an individual, that's a failure of the system, right. We need to step up to that. We need to innovate because that's an unintended consequence of the failure of a system. So we could talk about the averages that we're proud of from an affordability, but we need to make sure we continue to innovate till it works for everyone or we could talk about the fact that we have leading breadth of network access through our pharmacy networks, coupled with our home delivery, yet when you look at the uniqueness of America in some rural locations may not have the access or accessibility in a specific case. And therefore, the market is not working for those individuals. Hence, you see some of the innovations we step forward on.  Our copay assurance program directly goes at the out-of-pocket predictability for individuals under a variety of circumstances. Our rural pharmacy and independent pharmacy initiatives go directly at specific actions to support individuals. So the averages when we sit and look at the data is accepted, we need to do better, and we're stepping forward as a leader to do better from that standpoint. As it relates to employers, our retention rates and our new business growth rates reinforce the fact that by and large, employers see us as being successful. I would note that our ClearCareRx program that we just rolled out, that was two years in design and we worked with about a dozen sophisticated large employers to design those programs to work for them and work for us and how we can roll those out and scale. And as we sit here today, we have hundreds of clients together with our Evernorth team and our Express Scripts team talking about future innovation. So there remains high receptivity and high receptivity to the advancements we're making in terms of further transparency in clinical programs, but they like their choice. They like having the choice of financing mechanisms, which we are aligned with. And then finally, maybe just to manage time, on the 2024 selling season, 2024 will be another year of growth for us in the Evernorth service portfolio. We will see strong retention. As I noted, our retention has historically been in the mid-90s or better. We will see strong retention and we will see good growth as our products and programs resonate in the marketplace. Lisa, thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you Ms. Gill. Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Valiquette with Barclays. You may ask your question.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning. So regarding the Evernorth results in the first quarter, you mentioned they were in line with the expectations. Just with the script volume though being down, just curious to get more color on that? And also, I know you're not giving script volume guidance for the full year, but just curious if the trends in the first quarter are good run rates for the full year? Thanks. \nBrian Evanko: Good morning Steve, it's Brian. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, our Evernorth results are very much in line with expectations for the quarter. One thing that's important to keep in mind, David mentioned 40% of the revenue in Evernorth now is derived from our specialty pharmacy business. And as you can appreciate, the Specialty Pharmacy script counts end up being dwarfed by the generics and the higher-volume script counts that come through the PBM. So it's a little bit misleading to look at the aggregate script counts for those reasons. And I'd note our -- the revenue in the Specialty Pharmacy grew mid-teens year-over-year. So it was a very strong grower. You saw strong script growth in specialty, but again, it was dwarfed by the big picture of the PBM generic volumes moving around a bit. And as you think about the overall script counts year-on-year, I think of the client mix changes that occurred from 2022 to 2023 is driving a good bit of that and that really drove the kind of flattish all-in script counts. Now as we look forward to 2024, obviously, we prepare to onboard Centene, you'll see a meaningful step-up in that metric. But as I mentioned earlier, with the specialty pharmacy growing at such an attractive rate, it's a bit masked when you look purely the script count metrics. So hopefully, that helps a bit. And when you put all those pieces together, we're getting confident and comfortable with the full year outlook in terms of Evernorth income.\nSteven Valiquette: Perfect, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you Mr. Valiquette. Our next question comes from Mr. Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.\nNathan Rich: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the PBM and the regulatory focus, David. You mentioned that not all pharmacy benefit designs work for everyone. And the target, I think, of much of the legislation is focused on lowering out-of-pocket cost for patients. You've had plan options in the past that address some of these areas. I know you said that clients like having that choice. But are there -- is there any middle ground in terms of different solutions that you couldn't maybe roll out more broadly that would address some of these pain points kind of proactively ahead of maybe being forced legislatively? And I guess kind of my follow-up to that is client preferences I think kind of changed relatively slowly over time. I guess if we did see legislation go in place, how quickly could you kind of shift the client -- shift clients to new payment models to kind of adjust to a new regulatory backdrop?\nDavid Cordani: Good morning Nate. So first, on the affordability in the out-of-pocket, choices have been in the marketplace for some time. And important to note, by and large, as I noted before, on average those programs are working well in terms of the balance of overall affordability. And planned sponsors made trade-offs in terms of how much is put in premiums, how much is put in the benefits, etcetera from that standpoint. Two, just pointing you to specific because you said actions we could take, in 2019, we rolled out the first of its kind, the patient assurance program for insulin-dependent diabetics, cap monthly costs at $25 will stop. There's 11 million people benefiting from that program today as you see more focus relative to insulin. So we can have and will from that standpoint. Second, as you click down because, in many cases, the devils in the details, as you roll out new programs, you learn that, for example, some of the copay assurance programs can work in an HRA program, but in some cases don't work in a HSA program because of the regulatory requirement to the HSA program. They'll only work for preventative drugs, but they won't work for a broader class of drugs. So that now enables us to be more consultative with employers to make sure there's even a more pinpointed focus on benefit design and communication strategies as open enrollment happens because in some cases, an individual will enroll in an HSA, yet learn later that they have more dislocation in their out-of-pocket costs in a given month from the copay. So my point is actions taken, actions being taken, more precision that is necessary from that standpoint. As it relates to the -- how quickly we could pivot, we've proven tremendous flexibility in our model. Some of the additional data we're providing, we noted even last year at our Investor Day, we would continue to push ourselves with expanded disclosures and you're seeing more and more. We can pivot, we will pivot, we will continue to offer choice and the tools exist today as exemplary with our ClearCareRx program to provide further choice that use different financing mechanisms. So we are confident that we will be able to flex rapidly, if necessary. But we want to also ensure that we are a voice for employers to still work to preserve choices for them as how they want to finance their programs, how they want to manage their overall cost and predictability from that standpoint. But to reassure you, we have ample flexibility to flex rapidly.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Rich. Our next question comes from Mr. A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.\nAlbert Rice: Hi everybody. I guess I'll try to pivot away from the PBM question. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned your ongoing discussions with VillageMD about putting in place value-based contracting. I wonder if you can give us any further update on that, when you start to think about your 2024 bids commercially and MA, will any of those arrangements be part of the package that you offer or a factor in your bids and -- so it's about 2024 anything on the MA final rate notice and whether that changes your view on growth or margin trajectory that you're on in MA?\nDavid Cordani: A.J. good morning. You tucked a lot of questions in there, but let me start from the top. Relative to value-based care, before I hit the Village first, we've had a long commitment and positive track record relative to value-based care programs. Our orientation, as you may recall, is oriented around partnering, using data in collaborating with additional care extended resources to drive better, more consistent clinical outcomes and therefore overall value. Today, think about order of magnitude approaching 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based program. And depending on what you're looking at commercial or individual exchange, 40% or 50% of lives benefiting from the value-based program. And I'd underscore that we're seeing benefits from that in our continued market-leading lower medical cost trend. Specific to Village, we're pleased to advance and even further partnering more deeply with Village and collaborating with them. There are many ways in which we'll collaborate with Village to further accelerate value-based tier care traction off of their already successful model. I would note and highlight one of the portions that we are really excited about with Village is they've proven their current value-based care approach for commercial as well as Medicare Advantage. And our model with them has the ability to design and benefit from not only commercial and Medicare Advantage, but ASO and guaranteed cost as we bring more Evernorth services and collaborate with them as we curate more specialty networks, etcetera, going forward. As it relates to the part of your question, are there benefits in our current pricing as a result of our village initiative, they are starting to yield benefits already, starting to contribute to pricing in specific markets where the initiatives are underway is the headline. As it relates to your last question relative to big strategy, rate notice, etcetera, you should think about our view is our net rate for 2024 approximates the industry average. We take all the puts and takes that are framed in. Secondly, as you know, we're in the latter part of the bid cycle right now, so it would be premature and inappropriate for me to speak in any depth relative to our specific pricing strategy for 2024. We're pleased with our growth in 2023. We're pleased to see the 10% that we wheeled today and the traction in some of our markets that are maturing, and we will work on a market-by-market basis relative to the bid strategies and look forward to updates as we get into the second half of the year. Thanks, A.J.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Rice. Our next question comes from Mr. Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. And I'll just echo how much we appreciate the comments on the PBM transparency there. I wanted to follow up with a couple of things on the PBM. The first is -- and so 20% of your profits come from those spread contracts and rebates. If the government did pass what they're talking about this year, how would -- how are your contracts structured such that you could pivot away, is that something that would have to happen over time, what would the near-term impact be versus the longer term? And then secondly, I've gotten a lot of questions on 340B given what one of your peers talked about is a pretty meaningful headwind versus their expectations this year. So curious if you can give us some color there in terms of maybe what percentage of earnings come from 340B or how your outlook has changed there within your [indiscernible]? Thanks. \nDavid Cordani: Good morning Justin. I'm going to take your questions. It's David. I'll take your questions in reverse order. Specific to 340B, we've seen some recent extrapolation of what potential exposure could be for us based upon what some others said or the size of certain other programs. I would start by saying we think those estimates are overstated. So now let me step back. By way of context, we do believe the 340B represents an important series of capabilities, in many cases, for hospitals to benefit from more affordable pharmaceuticals for underserved populations. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally removed or made it much more difficult for those hospitals to engender those benefits. By way of context, we saw deceleration, some deceleration in our volumes in the first half of 2022. We saw that deceleration trough mid-2022 and we saw volumes begin to increase in the second half of 2022 is different data sharing and other activities move forward. As it relates to our impact, we have factored into our plan for the year and our most recent updated outlook for the year, our best estimate, which includes some dampening of the overall program as it relates to our results, but I would stress, some of these extrapolation based on the size of certain other programs, we think is overstated. This is manageable within our portfolio and not a material driver of the overall Evernorth portfolio. As it relates to your first question, which I really appreciate, Justin, I can't give you a precise answer to your question. If we take a theoretical and say that legislation is passed tomorrow, that creates an immediacy, which we do believe will transpire. In fact, if you could look at some of the most recent dialogue coming out of committees and otherwise for the consideration of consideration of consideration being implemented in the latter half of 2025, for example, we don't think that theoretical exists. Having said that, you should think that we have contractual by and large, contractual frameworks that take into consideration unanticipated immediate legislative or regulatory movement. We don't believe that is the case. We will continue to advocate for our clients. We will continue to work to ensure that choice exist. And as we made clear, even with our ClearCareRx program, we have the tools and flexibility to deliver what a client wants from a choice standpoint, with or without sharing and being able to earn a sustained attractive margin for the value we create. Thanks, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Lake. Our next question comes from Ms. Erin Wright, Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nErin Wright: Hey, thanks. You mentioned some elevated disenrollment in the second half embedded in your guidance from a softening economy and can you quantify that range or how are you thinking about that and what are you seeing now and how did that change relative to what you were anticipating previously? Thanks. \nBrian Evanko: Good morning Erin, it's Brian. So first of all, I just would reiterate, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. When you think of our U.S. commercial Medicare Advantage and our U.S. individual business is all showing strong year-to-date results running ahead of expectations in aggregate for enrollment levels. And that builds upon our really strong performance in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As I mentioned, we are not yet seeing signs of economic pressure in our book, for example, the disenrollment levels in the most recent months are very much in line with historical norms. But as I mentioned, we have assumed some level of elevated disenrollment in the back half of the year in order to be prudent. And in addition to that, we typically see some in-year attrition within the U.S. individual book over the course of a given calendar year. And as I mentioned, we still see organic growth in net client counts in the U.S. commercial business, particularly as the select segment continues its sales cycle through the balance of the year. And finally, we have not yet incorporated any assumption of potential volume for Medicaid redetermination. So that represents pure upside for us. And so should we not see economic weakness transpire later in the year or should we pick up some unexpected customers from the Medicaid redeterminations we may have some upside in our Cigna Healthcare customer accounts. Final comment I'll give you just in terms of sensitivities. In prior economic downturns, we've seen for every 1% change in the unemployment rate, our commercial employer levels enrollment levels will move by either 0.5% to 1% as it relates to 1% move in the unemployment rate. So it gives you a sense for the sensitivity relative to the size of the book as you think about how to model the rest of the year.\nOperator: Thank you Ms. Wright. Our next question comes from Mr. Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. You may ask your question.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. It seems like cost cut really wasn't a problem for you in the quarter, but still after earnings season is basically over, still trying to reconcile the strong numbers from the providers and the med tech companies with a relatively solid numbers from the managed care industry. Can you help reconcile what seems to be an apparent conflict and any color on cost trend, particularly, I guess, through the quarter and into this quarter would be helpful? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few thoughts for you in terms of the reconciliation to the provider side, etcetera. I'd start by saying we're pleased to having delivered another strong quarter here of MCR performance in line or better than expected. So I'm pleased to start the year in that position. You can think of that as a function of the strong progress we've made in recent years with our affordability initiatives. So that includes items such as our provider contracting improvements, clinical program evolution, siding [ph] care optimization, along with our continued pricing discipline. So all that served us well, all while allowing us to grow 1.5 million customers year-to-date. As you think about the first quarter specifically, the favorability that we saw was driven by lighter-than-expected viral or respiratory claims. So in this case, think of COVID, flu, RSV in aggregate running a little bit lower than what we had been expecting. Now on the non-viral side, we had planned in price or normalized utilization levels to transpire in 2023 that were more consistent with pre-COVID levels. And during the first quarter, that's what we saw. We saw non-viral utilization, reflecting this more normalized pattern. But again, this was in line with our expectations that we had planned and priced for stepping into the year.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Fischbeck. Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Taylor with Cowen. You may ask your question.\nGary Taylor: Hey, good morning. Quick question. I do appreciate the PBM disclosure because obviously, if you're talking about 10% to 15% of the company's total earnings that you expect to retain it seems like the down 26% stock price is quite overdone this year. So I appreciate that. Are we going to see some of that financial disclosure in the 10-Q when you talk about new disclosure, will that be around some of the economics of retained spread in rebate? And then my second question is we did see the Florida pass or I believe, is going to be signed or just was signed by the Governor that would prohibit spread pricing in Florida across all lines of business. And just wondered what the -- if you knew what the implementation date on that was and just how quickly you had to sort of move to address that employer?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning Gary, it's Brian. I'll take your first question. I think David will comment on the situation that you referenced in Florida. As it relates to the incremental disclosures, so really, those were designed today to give all of our investors some further context on the earnings sources within Evernorth, just given the amount of misinformation in the ecosystem. And so alongside our 10-Q that we filed today, you'll find a supplemental disclosure that provides some additional qualitative information as well as some metrics that we think are important to help various stakeholders understand what the PBM does and doesn't do. And hopefully, we find that investors look at that as useful information. As it relates to some of the additional data points David and I shared, for example, the 20% of pretax adjusted earnings associated with PBM retained rebates and spread. As we referenced, that percentage has declined over time. At this point, we're not necessarily intending to update that every quarter in the Q but we will obviously give you context for how the earnings sources are evolving over time as that business continues to grow. David, do you want to comment on the...\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Good morning Gary, relative to the Florida activity, one of the two components we talked about. We talked about rebates. This is specific to your question relative to spread. We're still working through the details from a state standpoint. Interesting timing as well. We literally have our large client gathering that is taking place as we speak. This is a topic of discussion for clients in terms of digesting the ramifications. We'll have the ability to flex our capabilities as I noted in prior questions relative to this one aspect as it's implemented. I don't want to go any further in terms of quantifying or otherwise. Big picture, it's manageable. Specifically, we'll work through client by client, the impacts relative to their respective forward footprint and then considerations on a go-forward basis as to whether or not they want to flex financing mechanisms for other geographies going forward, using our capabilities. But we have the ability to flex, and we will be compliant, obviously, with the implementation time line.\nGary Taylor: Thanks, appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you Mr. Taylor. Our next question comes from Mr. Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, Yes, I wanted to ask about ClearCareRx. I guess, first, how quickly do you think this model will be adopted, is there any kind of target for this that you can share? And then obviously, your clients are sophisticating of access to pools to evaluate your economics during RFPs. But how do you think about competitive dynamics of the industry as a whole over time could be progressing to explicit fee-based pricing models? Thanks. \nDavid Cordani: Good morning. Stephen, the ClearCareRx program, as I noted previously, we've worked for about two years with a small number, think of a dozen large sophisticated clients to design this program to work through the program to perfect aspects in a program, and we're excited to roll it out on a more extensive basis. Two, I would think about the addressable market as more the larger of the large clients working down given the immediacy of pass-through and then the potential cash flow management ramifications that it creates from that standpoint. So this will be another choice that's offered in the marketplace. I think to your broader question, inferred to your broader question, the relentless of ongoing commitment to innovation is mission-critical in any industry. In this subset of our industries, it's mission-critical and we're proud of the fact that we had leadership relative to a variety of programs. As I mentioned, insulin programs, as we talked before about our Embark program on high-cost gene therapies, our SafeGuardRx program, that is benefiting all of our clients relative to care management programs. TRCs, as you know, more therapeutic resource groups and centers that come together and focus on specific diagnosis and have detailed expertise and then how they're coordinated with the medical professionals and how they coordinated with the behavioral professionals are mission critical. So the path of innovation and whether it is, to your point, a fee-based environment that transpires may transpire. However, having the choice, we think, is mission critical. Finally, for you and maybe the broader audience, we may see some similarities as we've seen in the medical space where as you think about our approach, I mean, the medical benefit space, our approach was broad funding mechanisms and financing mechanisms, an agnostic model, meaning we could flex in any of them, whether it's self-funded, self-funded with stop loss on risk management, a share return model, or a guaranteed cost model. And we see those same trends manifesting in the pharmacy space and we're in a position to lead there. So largest of large employers, two years in its design, it's perfected and it's ready to scale. We don't think the entire market shifts to this in 2024. We think there'll be more adoption of programs like ClearCareRx, and we're happy to be the leader in the space.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Baxter. Our next question comes from Mr. Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. You may ask your question.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on the individual book. It looks like it came in maybe 100,000 or so more than expected. Maybe where did those lives come from and was that the reason for the increased total membership guidance? And then maybe any early signs on utilization and other metrics that give you comfort that you priced that business correctly?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning Josh, it's Brian. So overall, the strong individual customer growth in 2023, you can think of as a combination of a few things. So one, obviously, the industry had some strong growth rates from 2022 into 2023. We also had some new market entries and there were some competitors that exited certain geographies where we participate in. And if you think about the sources of that, our growth came from a combination of existing geographies and those three new states that we stepped into, which were Texas, Indiana, and South Carolina here in 2023. We did see the majority of our growth come from three states in particular. So Texas, Georgia and Florida drove the majority of the growth not any one specific city, we're in multiple locations in those states. Fortunately, we have a long history in these geographies that goes well beyond the U.S. individual business, meaning our commercial and MA businesses has been operating in those locations for some time. So our provider engagement and clinical programs should benefit these individual customers as well. Now for purposes of the claims experience and the margins, etcetera, for the 2023 calendar year, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our long-term goal, which is 4% to 6% in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. So we expect to run below that 4% to 6% long-term goal. Given the substantial amount of new customers we've added in 2023, we think this is a prudent assumption to make from the standpoint of the margins running below that long-term target. While it's early in the year so far, the claims are largely in line with our expectations through the first quarter. And importantly, as you think about the first quarter actuals as well as our full year outlook, we've assumed that we will be in a risk adjustment payable position for the 2023 plan year despite the fact that we were in a receivable position for the 2022 plan year. So again, we think that's a prudent assumption to make at this early juncture in the year until later. And in 2023 when we see some industry-wide risk adjustment data that will help us to recalibrate that assumption. As you think about the longer run, this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help contribute to the segment's long-term margin expansion and income growth. So overall, a good start to the year. Still a long way to go for the full year, and we think we've taken a prudent posture as it relates to the accruals.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Raskin. Our next question comes from Mr. Scott Fidel with Stephens. You may ask your question.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I would be interested if you could maybe just drill in a bit more into your latest thinking on both the GLP-1 drugs and then the emerging Alzheimer's drugs, maybe give us just some insights from both the Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth business segment perspectives? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning Scott, it's David. Clearly, the GLP-1 drugs have been in the price pretty significantly. And by way of headline, we think the drugs and the treatment protocols represent a positive step forward specifically for diabetics as such. We have coverage within our formulary. I would remind you that early on when the first within the class came out, we actually stepped in with some value-based care arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers and have seen positive contributions for both the benefit of patients as well as our clients. But to date, I'd also add that employers have had a more limited appetite to expand coverage beyond clinical diagnoses such as diabetes for certain lifestyle treatments. There has been some, but we've seen more limited adoption of that thus far. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect to have our P&T committee and our internal clinical oversight continue to monitor the progress relative to ongoing testing development in this important class. I would take that trend and carry it across similarly relative to the Alzheimer's space, clearly, a lot of interest excitement and demand for drugs within the Alzheimer's space to help a growing population confronting this challenging disease from that standpoint. We've seen more limited adoption thus far. We see some early data like you're seeing right now relative to next-in-class [Technical Difficulty] seeming to demonstrate some promise going through FDA, working through CMS relative to Medicare reimbursement, and we will stay tightly aligned relative to that. On a final note, if you put a circle around this, I think you've heard in the latter part of your question, you can think about these drugs is, in some cases, creating cost on the benefit side of the equation with an offset of a benefit, clearly. But you should also think about the Cigna Group's portfolio because of Evernorth is having some dimension of a natural hedge given the size and sophistication and reach of our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy programs and the breadth of the clients we're able to serve within that portfolio. So we see this as a growth opportunity within the Evernorth portfolio and the clinical depth we have in there in terms of coordinating services for individuals will be helpful in terms of ensuring that the value is delivered. So emerging space in both categories some promise, early adoption, some track record in value-based care. And importantly, I would underscore, we have a natural hedge relative to some cost pressure you would think about in the benefit space through our high-performing services space.\nOperator: Thank you Mr. Fidel. Our last question comes from Kevin -- Mr. Kevin Caliendo with UBS. You may ask your question.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks for getting me in. Getting back to the 20% of Evernorth earnings, does that include the ESI rebates and pass-through and spread, does that also account for the medical profit like the pharmacy profit in the Medical segment as well or is that separate? And since you've been in such a giving mood, can you provide us -- is there any transparency on that number?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So the 20% that we made reference to is the PBM retained rebates and the retail spread that comprise the Evernorth segment's contribution specifically. So as with all of our clients of Evernorth, whether they be the Cigna Healthcare affiliated health plan or our unaffiliated health plan clients, they choose how they would like to use the pharmacy value that we create for them. So to your question, if there are pharmacy earnings in the Cigna Healthcare segment, that's not reflected in the 20% metric we're specifically dimensioning the Evernorth contribution. And then like I said, the Cigna Healthcare health plan decides how they choose to deploy any value that's created from Evernorth to sister company. David, maybe you want to pile on here?\nDavid Cordani: And Kevin to add on that, as you think about the health plans that are served by Evernorth, if you consider the total cost of care, a health plan through their medical contracting, ancillary contracting, pharmacy contract behavioral contracting, aggregate a total cost of care to generate their price point. So in the case of a guaranteed cost offering or a risk-based offering, the cost of the pharmaceuticals are baked into that from that standpoint, whether that's commercial, individual exchange business, or Medicare Advantage business for health plan. So that's value delivered just like the value that's delivered for their medical contracting, their DME contracting, their behavioral contracting, etcetera, and part of their overall cost equation that they'll factor into the net pricing that they're offering to the marketplace.\nKevin Caliendo: Appreciate it, thanks guys. \nOperator: Thank you Mr. Caliendo. I will turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks again for joining our call today. Let me just reinforce a couple of quick points. One, we are confident that we will deliver our increased adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth outlook for this year. To do that, our team remains focused on everyone we serve and is executing with good focus and discipline, all while we continue to innovate. We will also continue our leadership in working to improve health care, including our increased transparency, choice and clinical programs to drive down further drug costs for our customers, our patients and our clients. I would want to underscore that the progress we continue to make all starts with in is fueled by the dedication and commitment of our 70,000 coworkers around the world who I want to thank for their commitment and demonstration every day to working to make a very positive difference in the people's lives we are able to serve both formally through our commercial relationships as well as in the communities we serve each and every day. Finally, thank you for joining our call. And as always, we look forward to our continued discussions in the future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's First Quarter 2023 Results Review.

            "content": "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's first quarter 2023 results and discuss our updated outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong start to the year. The first quarter adjusted earnings per share were above our expectations, demonstrating focused execution across our high performing Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses. Looking at the quarter specifically, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue growth of 6% to $46.5 billion, after tax adjusted earnings of $1.6 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $5.41, and cash flow from operations of $5 billion. This performance gives us the confidence to increase our full year adjusted earnings outlook to at least $24.70 per share.  Before I discuss our Evernorth results, I'll build on David's comments regarding our recent announcement to advance transparency around our PBM and I'll provide incremental details on our earnings drivers. I'd first start with a level setting that of our operating platforms ever takes up approximately 60% of earnings and Cigna Healthcare is about 40%. Within Evernorth, our Express Scripts PBM is a foundational asset with a diverse set of earnings sources including service and administrative fees, clinical programs, and value based care arrangements along with retained rebates and retail spread. These earnings sources are a function of the choices made by our clients. As David referenced, approximately 20% of Evernorth's adjusted pretax earnings are comprised of PBM retained rebates and retail spread. This percentage has decreased over time as we continue to expand fee based client relationships and as our Evernorth portfolio becomes more diverse and continues to grow. Importantly, as Evernorth's business mix has changed over the years, margins have remained stable. This speaks to our flexibility to adapt to an ever-changing market and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate disruption in the operating or regulatory environment. As David mentioned and I would underscore, our foundational PBM asset will continue to create and deliver significant value, which will allow us to sustain growth at attractive competitive returns.  Shifting to our current period Evernorth results, first quarter 2023 revenues grew 8% to $36.2 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, in line with our expectations. Evernorth results in the quarter were driven by continued strong growth in our high-performing specialty pharmacy business and our focus on affordability and delivering lowest net cost solutions for our customers and clients. Additionally, we continue to build our cross-enterprise leverage capabilities, providing an additional avenue for growth as we further deepen our relationships across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We also continue to make strategic investments, which serve to strengthen and grow our client relationships, expand our portfolio of products and services, and advance our digital capabilities. As it relates to our strategic partnerships, we remain on track in our implementation of the Centene contract that begins in 2024. And our collaboration with VillageMD is progressing and provides us an attractive opportunity to further accelerate our value-based care programs and capabilities. We will continue to expand these value-based solutions for the benefit of our Cigna Healthcare, U.S. commercial and U.S. government clients as well as other provider partners and Evernorth health plan clients.  Additionally, we remain confident around the multiyear accelerating biosimilar opportunity with high visibility into expected savings for customers and clients in the second half of this year, consistent with our prior expectations and regardless of utilization shifts for product approvals in the market. Overall, Evernorth continues to perform very well. Our diversified set of earnings streams, along with flexible financing models enable us to innovate and adapt through dynamic environments. Turning to Cigna Healthcare, first quarter 2023 adjusted revenues grew 12% to $12.7 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.1 billion, slightly above our expectations. The medical care ratio of 81.3% was better than expectations as overall utilization came in slightly favorable. This was reinforced by our clinical engagement models and related affordability initiatives as well as our continued pricing discipline. Turning to medical customers, we ended the quarter with 19.5 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.5 million customers since the end of 2022. This strong growth demonstrates the continued differentiation of our market-leading products and services. Our commercial customers increased 8% year-to-date aided by the addition of a large fee-based health plan client that expands upon an existing Evernorth relationship. And even excluding this client win, we drove organic customer growth across all of our U.S. commercial market segments. In our U.S. government business, we saw considerable growth in our U.S. Individual and Medicare Advantage customers, with MA growth of 10% on a year-to-date basis. Overall, Cigna Healthcare is off to a strong start in 2023 as we continue to deliver differentiated value and affordability to our customers and clients. Across our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we delivered strong first quarter financial results driven by our diversified portfolio of foundational and accelerated growth businesses, further bolstered by cross enterprise leverage. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2023. We have increased our expectations for full year 2023 consolidated adjusted revenues to at least $188 billion, enabled by continued growth and deepening customer relationships in Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. We are also increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to at least $24.70 per share. Consistent with our prior commentary, we expect earnings this year to be back half weighted in large part driven by Evernorth's earnings ramp over the course of the year with second half EPS contributing slightly below 55% of full year EPS. In Evernorth, we expect continued strong performance, all while investing in growth and innovation. We continue to expect Evernorth full year 2023 adjusted earnings of at least $6.4 billion. In Cigna Healthcare, we are raising our medical customer growth expectation to at least 1.3 million customers, an increase of 100,000 lives. We are improving our 2023 medical care ratio outlook to a range of 81.5% to 82.3% and we are raising our expected full year 2023 adjusted earnings to at least $4.425 billion. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we have yet to see material impact to Cigna Healthcare enrollment levels. We remain prudent with respect to our enrollment outlook for the rest of the year as evidenced by our full year guidance relative to the first quarter customer growth results. To be clear, we continue to expect underlying organic employer client growth as we move through the year. And our outlook continues to assume some elevated disenrollment in the second half of the year corresponding with some expected softening in the economy. Additionally, as a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate incremental customer growth from Medicaid redeterminations. Finally, when contemplating the Cigna Group's performance under various future economic scenarios, it's important to keep in mind that we have strategically positioned the company's portfolio of businesses to be more diversified than it was in prior economic downturns. This gives us confidence and resilience to weather dynamic macroeconomic environments.  Switching gears, let's move to our 2023 capital management position and outlook. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 42.2% as of March 31st. We expect to lower this ratio over the balance of the year, and we continue to target a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 40%. Year-to-date through May 4, 2023 we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.1 billion. And for full year 2023, we continue to expect at least $9 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and our cash flow outlook remains strong benefiting from our highly efficient service-based model that drives strategic flexibility, strong margins, and attractive returns on capital. So now to recap. First quarter results were above our expectations, reflecting strong contributions across our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses. Evernorth continued to deliver strong results with the first quarter in line with our expectations. While Cigna Healthcare had a strong start to the year, giving us confidence to deliver on our increased 2023 EPS guidance of at least $24.70. We continue to expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $28 consistent with our prior commentary. And over the long run, we continue to expect average annual EPS growth of 10% to 13% and are confident in our ability to adapt and navigate the operating and regulatory backdrop with our diversified business mix, and complementary capabilities across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning Steve, it's Brian. Yes, as I mentioned earlier, our Evernorth results are very much in line with expectations for the quarter. One thing that's important to keep in mind, David mentioned 40% of the revenue in Evernorth now is derived from our specialty pharmacy business. And as you can appreciate, the Specialty Pharmacy script counts end up being dwarfed by the generics and the higher-volume script counts that come through the PBM. So it's a little bit misleading to look at the aggregate script counts for those reasons. And I'd note our -- the revenue in the Specialty Pharmacy grew mid-teens year-over-year. So it was a very strong grower. You saw strong script growth in specialty, but again, it was dwarfed by the big picture of the PBM generic volumes moving around a bit. And as you think about the overall script counts year-on-year, I think of the client mix changes that occurred from 2022 to 2023 is driving a good bit of that and that really drove the kind of flattish all-in script counts. Now as we look forward to 2024, obviously, we prepare to onboard Centene, you'll see a meaningful step-up in that metric. But as I mentioned earlier, with the specialty pharmacy growing at such an attractive rate, it's a bit masked when you look purely the script count metrics. So hopefully, that helps a bit. And when you put all those pieces together, we're getting confident and comfortable with the full year outlook in terms of Evernorth income. Good morning Erin, it's Brian. So first of all, I just would reiterate, we're really pleased with the strong growth momentum across the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. When you think of our U.S. commercial Medicare Advantage and our U.S. individual business is all showing strong year-to-date results running ahead of expectations in aggregate for enrollment levels. And that builds upon our really strong performance in 2022, where we added nearly 1 million customers across the Cigna Healthcare platform. As I mentioned, we are not yet seeing signs of economic pressure in our book, for example, the disenrollment levels in the most recent months are very much in line with historical norms. But as I mentioned, we have assumed some level of elevated disenrollment in the back half of the year in order to be prudent. And in addition to that, we typically see some in-year attrition within the U.S. individual book over the course of a given calendar year. And as I mentioned, we still see organic growth in net client counts in the U.S. commercial business, particularly as the select segment continues its sales cycle through the balance of the year. And finally, we have not yet incorporated any assumption of potential volume for Medicaid redetermination. So that represents pure upside for us. And so should we not see economic weakness transpire later in the year or should we pick up some unexpected customers from the Medicaid redeterminations we may have some upside in our Cigna Healthcare customer accounts. Final comment I'll give you just in terms of sensitivities. In prior economic downturns, we've seen for every 1% change in the unemployment rate, our commercial employer levels enrollment levels will move by either 0.5% to 1% as it relates to 1% move in the unemployment rate. So it gives you a sense for the sensitivity relative to the size of the book as you think about how to model the rest of the year. Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So just a few thoughts for you in terms of the reconciliation to the provider side, etcetera. I'd start by saying we're pleased to having delivered another strong quarter here of MCR performance in line or better than expected. So I'm pleased to start the year in that position. You can think of that as a function of the strong progress we've made in recent years with our affordability initiatives. So that includes items such as our provider contracting improvements, clinical program evolution, siding [ph] care optimization, along with our continued pricing discipline. So all that served us well, all while allowing us to grow 1.5 million customers year-to-date. As you think about the first quarter specifically, the favorability that we saw was driven by lighter-than-expected viral or respiratory claims. So in this case, think of COVID, flu, RSV in aggregate running a little bit lower than what we had been expecting. Now on the non-viral side, we had planned in price or normalized utilization levels to transpire in 2023 that were more consistent with pre-COVID levels. And during the first quarter, that's what we saw. We saw non-viral utilization, reflecting this more normalized pattern. But again, this was in line with our expectations that we had planned and priced for stepping into the year. Good morning Gary, it's Brian. I'll take your first question. I think David will comment on the situation that you referenced in Florida. As it relates to the incremental disclosures, so really, those were designed today to give all of our investors some further context on the earnings sources within Evernorth, just given the amount of misinformation in the ecosystem. And so alongside our 10-Q that we filed today, you'll find a supplemental disclosure that provides some additional qualitative information as well as some metrics that we think are important to help various stakeholders understand what the PBM does and doesn't do. And hopefully, we find that investors look at that as useful information. As it relates to some of the additional data points David and I shared, for example, the 20% of pretax adjusted earnings associated with PBM retained rebates and spread. As we referenced, that percentage has declined over time. At this point, we're not necessarily intending to update that every quarter in the Q but we will obviously give you context for how the earnings sources are evolving over time as that business continues to grow. David, do you want to comment on the... Good morning Josh, it's Brian. So overall, the strong individual customer growth in 2023, you can think of as a combination of a few things. So one, obviously, the industry had some strong growth rates from 2022 into 2023. We also had some new market entries and there were some competitors that exited certain geographies where we participate in. And if you think about the sources of that, our growth came from a combination of existing geographies and those three new states that we stepped into, which were Texas, Indiana, and South Carolina here in 2023. We did see the majority of our growth come from three states in particular. So Texas, Georgia and Florida drove the majority of the growth not any one specific city, we're in multiple locations in those states. Fortunately, we have a long history in these geographies that goes well beyond the U.S. individual business, meaning our commercial and MA businesses has been operating in those locations for some time. So our provider engagement and clinical programs should benefit these individual customers as well. Now for purposes of the claims experience and the margins, etcetera, for the 2023 calendar year, we continue to expect the margins on this book will run below our long-term goal, which is 4% to 6% in our Cigna Healthcare income and MCR guidance reflects this. So we expect to run below that 4% to 6% long-term goal. Given the substantial amount of new customers we've added in 2023, we think this is a prudent assumption to make from the standpoint of the margins running below that long-term target. While it's early in the year so far, the claims are largely in line with our expectations through the first quarter. And importantly, as you think about the first quarter actuals as well as our full year outlook, we've assumed that we will be in a risk adjustment payable position for the 2023 plan year despite the fact that we were in a receivable position for the 2022 plan year. So again, we think that's a prudent assumption to make at this early juncture in the year until later. And in 2023 when we see some industry-wide risk adjustment data that will help us to recalibrate that assumption. As you think about the longer run, this is a book of business that does represent a source of future embedded earnings power that will help contribute to the segment's long-term margin expansion and income growth. So overall, a good start to the year. Still a long way to go for the full year, and we think we've taken a prudent posture as it relates to the accruals. Good morning Kevin, it's Brian. So the 20% that we made reference to is the PBM retained rebates and the retail spread that comprise the Evernorth segment's contribution specifically. So as with all of our clients of Evernorth, whether they be the Cigna Healthcare affiliated health plan or our unaffiliated health plan clients, they choose how they would like to use the pharmacy value that we create for them. So to your question, if there are pharmacy earnings in the Cigna Healthcare segment, that's not reflected in the 20% metric we're specifically dimensioning the Evernorth contribution. And then like I said, the Cigna Healthcare health plan decides how they choose to deploy any value that's created from Evernorth to sister company. David, maybe you want to pile on here?"

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks Ralph. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining today's call. We begin 2023 with momentum and in the first quarter we again delivered strong performance and continued our long track record of innovating for customers, clients, and partners. Today I will discuss some of the key drivers fueling our growth during the quarter and we also talk about how we are leading the way to address evolving state health care needs with a flexible financial model providing multiple avenues to deliver and capture revenue. Specifically, I will describe how the durable and flexible pharmacy benefit services we harbor continue to drive in the marketplace. Finally, we will provide additional details about our financial results and discuss our outlook for 2023 and then we will take your questions. With that let's get started.  In the first quarter we delivered $46.5 billion in total revenues, $5.41 in adjusted earnings per share, and we are ranging our full year 2023 guidance for adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth. We are pleased with the strong start across Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare and we look forward -- as we look forward, we expect another very good year for the Cigna Group. Evernorth comprising pharmacy benefit services, specialty pharmacy, and Evernorth Care again contributed strong growth while retaining, expanding and winning new relationships for the employers, health plans, and governmental organizations we serve. Our foundational pharmacy benefit service business continued the strong performance demonstrating the value we provide to our clients and patients.  Specialty pharmacy which accounts for approximately 40% of Evernorth's total revenue drove outside its growth with a continued rise in new to market specialty drugs and increasing demand. Evernorth Care represents one of our most significant long-term growth opportunities given the growing needs a virtual care as well as for example behavioral health services. Insignia Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we achieved another quarter of revenue and customer growth with strong performance across our U.S. commercial, U.S. government, and international health businesses. With our focus on affordability and disciplined pricing, we are pleased with their medical cost performance and our medical care ratio which was 81.3%. Our U.S. commercial business is on pace for another good year. Our affordability initiatives continue to strengthen our overall competitive position and this has helped fuel our strong customer growth. Our momentum also is a reflection of how employers of all sizes rely upon our consultative approach and the breadth of our solutions to support the health, engagement, and productivity of their workforces. In U.S. government, our Medicare Advantage business is achieving above market growth in 2023 from a high quality and affordable plans, our geographic expansion, and the maturation of markets we previously expanded into. In a dynamic individual exchange market we also have substantial growth in our individual and family plan business, allowing us to bring Cigna Healthcare capabilities to a larger customer base. And in International Health, our earnings growth has been strong for the past few years and we expect positive top line and bottom line contributions again in 2023 given our high quality and localized health insurance solutions supported by our global provider network.  Overall, we're pleased with the quality, strength, and resilience demonstrated in our results and importantly, how they position us for another year of sustained growth and attractive value creation. Looking ahead, we are confident in our increased outlook for the year as well as our ability to sustainably deliver 10% to 13% compounded EPS growth over our strategic horizon along with providing an attractive dividend.  Today, I want to spend a few minutes on Express Risk, our pharmacy benefits business within Evernorth, including our recent announcements about how we are continuing to provide greater affordability, choice, and transparency for our clients and customers. Pharmacy services have an essential and impactful role in a time when in medical care, physical or behavioral are increasingly relying upon the use of pharmaceutical interventions. It's also important to recognize that successful care coordination programs for pharmacy services often create significant benefit and value for the medical services. We recognize the ongoing attention and legislative debate regarding the rising costs of prescription drugs. We are taking an active leadership role and I want to be clear about how we are using our differentiated capabilities to create and capture value out of the drug supply chain on behalf of our clients and customers.  First is the strength of our model, which is to deliver solutions and care coordination that address specific client needs and expand relationships with our full suite of services and capabilities, fueling our sustained attractive growth over time. Second, we are committed to enabling and prioritizing choice for our clients as we drive down costs. And third, we continue to build on our long track record of innovation to drive greater affordability, access, transparency and improved clinical outcomes. Stepping back, our Pharmacy Benefit Service business is achieving attractive growth because we're able to secure a diverse group of any growing client base, leading with the strength of our supply chain, clinical and care management programs. With our proven model Express Groups client retention rates are consistently in the mid-90s or higher and we've been able to continuously grow our pipeline and win new business, from medium size to the largest employers, from the local health plans to national players, and even the largest government sponsored programs.  We've expanded our efforts to advocate on behalf of our clients and customers particularly as it relates to financing models which are key areas of focus for some of the current legislative proposals. The Express Scripts business model starts with the commitment to enabling and prioritizing choice in benefit design and financing options for clients who are the primary financers of their employee benefit programs. This includes providing them the option to finance the cost of their programs by allowing us to share in the discounts we secure on their behalf, be it rebates or spread pricing. Our clients choose amongst these models based upon their needs for managing risk and greater predictability for the pharmacy costs as well as their cash flow.  For context, across the breadth of our Express Scripts Pharmacy Benefit Service portfolio today over 95% of rebate dollars are passed through to clients. The key point is that each client chooses the financing mechanism that works best for them. They have choices in how they pay for the value we deliver and many find that using rebate sharing or spread pricing generates a stronger level of alignment incentives in addition to being able to plan for predictable cash flow that it generates. Proposes to limit the availability and scope of these options will result in less choice for thousands of employers, health plans and government, the clients we serve and increase their costs over time. As it relates to Express Scripts, we are confident in our ability to earn sustainable and attractive margins for our services under a variety of legislative scenarios. We are able to create value through the breadth of our capabilities from supply chain to benefit design, driving competition amongst drug manufacturers to bring costs down, and deliver better health outcomes through our clinical programs. One area of focus for multiple stakeholders has been the amount of income we earn from rebate retention and retail spread. To put this in context, we expect about 20% of Evernorth's 2023 pretax adjusted earnings to come from Express Scripts retention of rebates and retail spread. This percentage has trended down over time and we expect it to continue trending downward. This is fueled by our ongoing innovation and greater diversification of our Evernorth businesses. I would also remind you that these financing options that we provide the clients are developed in exchange for lower service fees. So said otherwise if these programs decrease further overtime fee based income would increase. Therefore, we are confident that if some of these payment vehicles were reduced or removed by regulatory change or client preference, Express Scripts has a broad set of capabilities that create value and will continue to earn an attractive return.  Let me provide some specific examples that reinforce our flexibility and durable model and how we tap into our long track record of innovation for better outcomes on behalf of our customers and clients who are seeking greater affordability and transparency for prescription drugs. First, we're taking several steps to expand transparency. Express Scripts new ClearCareRX fully demonstrates the flexibility we have for prescription drug benefits where clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for prescriptions. They receive 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtained by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies. They pay one service fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, product services, reporting analytics and the program is supported by a fully audible mechanism. In addition, clients also benefit from guarantees to keep Express Scripts accountable for clinical and financial performance measures, including improvements in overall inheritance rates and patient outcomes. Additional steps to drive even greater transparency include providing clients with enhanced financial and feed disclosures regarding their spread pricing programs when they exist. Along with today's release about our first quarter financial results, you will also find additional disclosures we are providing about Express Scripts model in our quarterly regulatory filings and on our new microsite. We will also offer a new digital pharmacy benefits statement for customers starting in 2024. The statement will share drug pricing information, out of pocket costs and the net value delivered by Express Scripts on behalf of customers. With respect to the broader issue of drug pricing, to be clear, we were fully aligned with lowering costs of prescription drugs for customers. For example, Express Scripts Patient Assurance program launched in 2019 capped out of market costs for eligible members of select diabetes and cardiovascular medications. In 2022 alone, customers taking insulin saved more than $18 million because of this program. Now with the introduction of our new copay assurance plan, we are taking further action to cap out our pocket costs for customers in client prescription drug benefits at $5 for generic drugs, $25 for preferred brand medications, and $45 for preferred specialty medications. Finally, we also have a series of groundbreaking initiatives to further support pharmacists in rural communities across the United States. We are offering increased reimbursement to true independent pharmacists and partnering in opportunities to expand their clinical practices to further support care needs of the local communities. We are also convening an advisory committee of community pharmacists. These initiatives will encourage better care, expanded access to lower prices for rural Americans, as well as increasing a more sustainable revenue stream for independent pharmacists. We are encouraged by how our recent actions have been received by a wide range of stakeholders, including clients, our pharmacy network partners and policymakers. They recognize our commitment as a leader and trusted partner that could use to create value through our deep expertise in designing programs for specific client needs, driving innovation, and broadening our reach. In summary, we are demonstrating our leadership in the competitive pharmacy benefits market that is such a critical building block for the American healthcare system. We are serving specific client needs through the strength of our model and the effectiveness of our care coordination programs, allowing us to drive sustained attractive growth. We are continuing to advocate for clients and their ability to choose the appropriateness of programs that work best for the business as we help to lower costs. And we are continuing to innovate in driving greater affordability, transparency, and improved outcomes for those we serve.  Now let me briefly recap our performance for the quarter and our outlook. In the first quarter, we continue to execute and perform well. We delivered for our customers, clients and partners and our business kept our commitment to our shareholders. We delivered adjusted EPS of $5.41 per share and we're pleased to have increased our full year outlook or adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth as well as an improved medical care ratio. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver and capture value in the dynamic and changing environment. We've shaped our business model to navigate varying economic conditions and our differentiated capabilities within Evernorth to provide us with the flexibility to meet unique client needs and potential changes caused by regulatory requirements. Additionally, our business is driving growth that is generating strong cash flows and we are confident that we will further create value for successful and effective capital deployment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Lisa, you put a lot in there. Good morning and thanks for the questions. Let me try to touch on each. First, as we step back, as I noted, we're quite proud of the results that we have delivered and continue to deliver in view of the PBMs using that acronym, but the pharmacy service organizations are the organizations that relentlessly work to improve affordability for the benefit of a broad constituency group. I think to your first question, if we step back, well, we could point to tremendous results in terms of clinical trends, outcome, affordability on average, less than $1 increase in out-of-pocket costs for individuals. We do recognize, and I think this is part of the legislation or the legislative energy, the program still don't work for everyone.  So for example, while the programs are designed to generate overall affordability, if there's a high deductible plan is an illustration and in the month of January, someone has -- it is a deductible and has a significant out-of-pocket for our pharmaceutical experience that creates a financial dislocation for an individual, that's a failure of the system, right. We need to step up to that. We need to innovate because that's an unintended consequence of the failure of a system. So we could talk about the averages that we're proud of from an affordability, but we need to make sure we continue to innovate till it works for everyone or we could talk about the fact that we have leading breadth of network access through our pharmacy networks, coupled with our home delivery, yet when you look at the uniqueness of America in some rural locations may not have the access or accessibility in a specific case. And therefore, the market is not working for those individuals. Hence, you see some of the innovations we step forward on.  Our copay assurance program directly goes at the out-of-pocket predictability for individuals under a variety of circumstances. Our rural pharmacy and independent pharmacy initiatives go directly at specific actions to support individuals. So the averages when we sit and look at the data is accepted, we need to do better, and we're stepping forward as a leader to do better from that standpoint. As it relates to employers, our retention rates and our new business growth rates reinforce the fact that by and large, employers see us as being successful. I would note that our ClearCareRx program that we just rolled out, that was two years in design and we worked with about a dozen sophisticated large employers to design those programs to work for them and work for us and how we can roll those out and scale. And as we sit here today, we have hundreds of clients together with our Evernorth team and our Express Scripts team talking about future innovation. So there remains high receptivity and high receptivity to the advancements we're making in terms of further transparency in clinical programs, but they like their choice. They like having the choice of financing mechanisms, which we are aligned with. And then finally, maybe just to manage time, on the 2024 selling season, 2024 will be another year of growth for us in the Evernorth service portfolio. We will see strong retention. As I noted, our retention has historically been in the mid-90s or better. We will see strong retention and we will see good growth as our products and programs resonate in the marketplace. Lisa, thanks for the questions. Good morning Nate. So first, on the affordability in the out-of-pocket, choices have been in the marketplace for some time. And important to note, by and large, as I noted before, on average those programs are working well in terms of the balance of overall affordability. And planned sponsors made trade-offs in terms of how much is put in premiums, how much is put in the benefits, etcetera from that standpoint. Two, just pointing you to specific because you said actions we could take, in 2019, we rolled out the first of its kind, the patient assurance program for insulin-dependent diabetics, cap monthly costs at $25 will stop. There's 11 million people benefiting from that program today as you see more focus relative to insulin. So we can have and will from that standpoint. Second, as you click down because, in many cases, the devils in the details, as you roll out new programs, you learn that, for example, some of the copay assurance programs can work in an HRA program, but in some cases don't work in a HSA program because of the regulatory requirement to the HSA program. They'll only work for preventative drugs, but they won't work for a broader class of drugs. So that now enables us to be more consultative with employers to make sure there's even a more pinpointed focus on benefit design and communication strategies as open enrollment happens because in some cases, an individual will enroll in an HSA, yet learn later that they have more dislocation in their out-of-pocket costs in a given month from the copay. So my point is actions taken, actions being taken, more precision that is necessary from that standpoint. As it relates to the -- how quickly we could pivot, we've proven tremendous flexibility in our model. Some of the additional data we're providing, we noted even last year at our Investor Day, we would continue to push ourselves with expanded disclosures and you're seeing more and more. We can pivot, we will pivot, we will continue to offer choice and the tools exist today as exemplary with our ClearCareRx program to provide further choice that use different financing mechanisms. So we are confident that we will be able to flex rapidly, if necessary. But we want to also ensure that we are a voice for employers to still work to preserve choices for them as how they want to finance their programs, how they want to manage their overall cost and predictability from that standpoint. But to reassure you, we have ample flexibility to flex rapidly. A.J. good morning. You tucked a lot of questions in there, but let me start from the top. Relative to value-based care, before I hit the Village first, we've had a long commitment and positive track record relative to value-based care programs. Our orientation, as you may recall, is oriented around partnering, using data in collaborating with additional care extended resources to drive better, more consistent clinical outcomes and therefore overall value. Today, think about order of magnitude approaching 75% of our MA lives are in a value-based program. And depending on what you're looking at commercial or individual exchange, 40% or 50% of lives benefiting from the value-based program. And I'd underscore that we're seeing benefits from that in our continued market-leading lower medical cost trend. Specific to Village, we're pleased to advance and even further partnering more deeply with Village and collaborating with them. There are many ways in which we'll collaborate with Village to further accelerate value-based tier care traction off of their already successful model. I would note and highlight one of the portions that we are really excited about with Village is they've proven their current value-based care approach for commercial as well as Medicare Advantage. And our model with them has the ability to design and benefit from not only commercial and Medicare Advantage, but ASO and guaranteed cost as we bring more Evernorth services and collaborate with them as we curate more specialty networks, etcetera, going forward. As it relates to the part of your question, are there benefits in our current pricing as a result of our village initiative, they are starting to yield benefits already, starting to contribute to pricing in specific markets where the initiatives are underway is the headline. As it relates to your last question relative to big strategy, rate notice, etcetera, you should think about our view is our net rate for 2024 approximates the industry average. We take all the puts and takes that are framed in. Secondly, as you know, we're in the latter part of the bid cycle right now, so it would be premature and inappropriate for me to speak in any depth relative to our specific pricing strategy for 2024. We're pleased with our growth in 2023. We're pleased to see the 10% that we wheeled today and the traction in some of our markets that are maturing, and we will work on a market-by-market basis relative to the bid strategies and look forward to updates as we get into the second half of the year. Thanks, A.J. Good morning Justin. I'm going to take your questions. It's David. I'll take your questions in reverse order. Specific to 340B, we've seen some recent extrapolation of what potential exposure could be for us based upon what some others said or the size of certain other programs. I would start by saying we think those estimates are overstated. So now let me step back. By way of context, we do believe the 340B represents an important series of capabilities, in many cases, for hospitals to benefit from more affordable pharmaceuticals for underserved populations. Some pharmaceutical manufacturers have unilaterally removed or made it much more difficult for those hospitals to engender those benefits. By way of context, we saw deceleration, some deceleration in our volumes in the first half of 2022. We saw that deceleration trough mid-2022 and we saw volumes begin to increase in the second half of 2022 is different data sharing and other activities move forward. As it relates to our impact, we have factored into our plan for the year and our most recent updated outlook for the year, our best estimate, which includes some dampening of the overall program as it relates to our results, but I would stress, some of these extrapolation based on the size of certain other programs, we think is overstated. This is manageable within our portfolio and not a material driver of the overall Evernorth portfolio. As it relates to your first question, which I really appreciate, Justin, I can't give you a precise answer to your question. If we take a theoretical and say that legislation is passed tomorrow, that creates an immediacy, which we do believe will transpire. In fact, if you could look at some of the most recent dialogue coming out of committees and otherwise for the consideration of consideration of consideration being implemented in the latter half of 2025, for example, we don't think that theoretical exists. Having said that, you should think that we have contractual by and large, contractual frameworks that take into consideration unanticipated immediate legislative or regulatory movement. We don't believe that is the case. We will continue to advocate for our clients. We will continue to work to ensure that choice exist. And as we made clear, even with our ClearCareRx program, we have the tools and flexibility to deliver what a client wants from a choice standpoint, with or without sharing and being able to earn a sustained attractive margin for the value we create. Thanks, Justin. Sure. Good morning Gary, relative to the Florida activity, one of the two components we talked about. We talked about rebates. This is specific to your question relative to spread. We're still working through the details from a state standpoint. Interesting timing as well. We literally have our large client gathering that is taking place as we speak. This is a topic of discussion for clients in terms of digesting the ramifications. We'll have the ability to flex our capabilities as I noted in prior questions relative to this one aspect as it's implemented. I don't want to go any further in terms of quantifying or otherwise. Big picture, it's manageable. Specifically, we'll work through client by client, the impacts relative to their respective forward footprint and then considerations on a go-forward basis as to whether or not they want to flex financing mechanisms for other geographies going forward, using our capabilities. But we have the ability to flex, and we will be compliant, obviously, with the implementation time line. Good morning. Stephen, the ClearCareRx program, as I noted previously, we've worked for about two years with a small number, think of a dozen large sophisticated clients to design this program to work through the program to perfect aspects in a program, and we're excited to roll it out on a more extensive basis. Two, I would think about the addressable market as more the larger of the large clients working down given the immediacy of pass-through and then the potential cash flow management ramifications that it creates from that standpoint. So this will be another choice that's offered in the marketplace. I think to your broader question, inferred to your broader question, the relentless of ongoing commitment to innovation is mission-critical in any industry. In this subset of our industries, it's mission-critical and we're proud of the fact that we had leadership relative to a variety of programs. As I mentioned, insulin programs, as we talked before about our Embark program on high-cost gene therapies, our SafeGuardRx program, that is benefiting all of our clients relative to care management programs. TRCs, as you know, more therapeutic resource groups and centers that come together and focus on specific diagnosis and have detailed expertise and then how they're coordinated with the medical professionals and how they coordinated with the behavioral professionals are mission critical. So the path of innovation and whether it is, to your point, a fee-based environment that transpires may transpire. However, having the choice, we think, is mission critical. Finally, for you and maybe the broader audience, we may see some similarities as we've seen in the medical space where as you think about our approach, I mean, the medical benefit space, our approach was broad funding mechanisms and financing mechanisms, an agnostic model, meaning we could flex in any of them, whether it's self-funded, self-funded with stop loss on risk management, a share return model, or a guaranteed cost model. And we see those same trends manifesting in the pharmacy space and we're in a position to lead there. So largest of large employers, two years in its design, it's perfected and it's ready to scale. We don't think the entire market shifts to this in 2024. We think there'll be more adoption of programs like ClearCareRx, and we're happy to be the leader in the space. Good morning Scott, it's David. Clearly, the GLP-1 drugs have been in the price pretty significantly. And by way of headline, we think the drugs and the treatment protocols represent a positive step forward specifically for diabetics as such. We have coverage within our formulary. I would remind you that early on when the first within the class came out, we actually stepped in with some value-based care arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers and have seen positive contributions for both the benefit of patients as well as our clients. But to date, I'd also add that employers have had a more limited appetite to expand coverage beyond clinical diagnoses such as diabetes for certain lifestyle treatments. There has been some, but we've seen more limited adoption of that thus far. And on a go-forward basis, we would expect to have our P&T committee and our internal clinical oversight continue to monitor the progress relative to ongoing testing development in this important class. I would take that trend and carry it across similarly relative to the Alzheimer's space, clearly, a lot of interest excitement and demand for drugs within the Alzheimer's space to help a growing population confronting this challenging disease from that standpoint. We've seen more limited adoption thus far. We see some early data like you're seeing right now relative to next-in-class [Technical Difficulty] seeming to demonstrate some promise going through FDA, working through CMS relative to Medicare reimbursement, and we will stay tightly aligned relative to that. On a final note, if you put a circle around this, I think you've heard in the latter part of your question, you can think about these drugs is, in some cases, creating cost on the benefit side of the equation with an offset of a benefit, clearly. But you should also think about the Cigna Group's portfolio because of Evernorth is having some dimension of a natural hedge given the size and sophistication and reach of our pharmacy and specialty pharmacy programs and the breadth of the clients we're able to serve within that portfolio. So we see this as a growth opportunity within the Evernorth portfolio and the clinical depth we have in there in terms of coordinating services for individuals will be helpful in terms of ensuring that the value is delivered. So emerging space in both categories some promise, early adoption, some track record in value-based care. And importantly, I would underscore, we have a natural hedge relative to some cost pressure you would think about in the benefit space through our high-performing services space. And Kevin to add on that, as you think about the health plans that are served by Evernorth, if you consider the total cost of care, a health plan through their medical contracting, ancillary contracting, pharmacy contract behavioral contracting, aggregate a total cost of care to generate their price point. So in the case of a guaranteed cost offering or a risk-based offering, the cost of the pharmaceuticals are baked into that from that standpoint, whether that's commercial, individual exchange business, or Medicare Advantage business for health plan. So that's value delivered just like the value that's delivered for their medical contracting, their DME contracting, their behavioral contracting, etcetera, and part of their overall cost equation that they'll factor into the net pricing that they're offering to the marketplace. Thanks again for joining our call today. Let me just reinforce a couple of quick points. One, we are confident that we will deliver our increased adjusted EPS, revenue and customer growth outlook for this year. To do that, our team remains focused on everyone we serve and is executing with good focus and discipline, all while we continue to innovate. We will also continue our leadership in working to improve health care, including our increased transparency, choice and clinical programs to drive down further drug costs for our customers, our patients and our clients. I would want to underscore that the progress we continue to make all starts with in is fueled by the dedication and commitment of our 70,000 coworkers around the world who I want to thank for their commitment and demonstration every day to working to make a very positive difference in the people's lives we are able to serve both formally through our commercial relationships as well as in the communities we serve each and every day. Finally, thank you for joining our call. And as always, we look forward to our continued discussions in the future."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference and review procedure on how to enter the queue to ask question at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our third quarter financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally, accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Before turning the call over, I will cover a couple items pertaining to our GAAP financial results. In the third quarter, we recorded shareholders' net income of $739 million or $2.63 per share. This is driven by a non-cash, after-tax, net realized investment loss of $1 billion or $3.69 per share related to VillageMD. This includes both the write-down of the remaining carrying value of the asset, as well as the impairment of the dividend, which is recognized as a special item in the quarter. This is excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share in our discussion of financial results. In the third quarter, we also recorded other after-tax net special item charges of $162 million or $0.58 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that when we make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full-year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share of purchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks Ralph. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. Today I'll spend a few minutes talking about our strong results in the third quarter and how we're advancing our growth strategy. I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2025, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds. Then Brian will share more detail about our results and our outlook for the rest of the year and we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Building on a track record of competitively differentiated performance, I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter the Cigna group delivered total revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. Our results are a testament to the collective depth and strength of our people and commitment, hard work and focus they bring to everything we do. We have deep continuity and the most experienced leadership team in the industry with more than 16-years average tenure across our growth platforms. And we continue to infuse new talent into the company from across many sectors and industries to round out our enterprise perspective. Our third quarter performance demonstrates how we harness the complementary capabilities of our two growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare to drive attractive growth. This quarter Evernorth anchored our results by delivering strong top and bottom line contributions generated by market leading innovation and affordability initiatives, particularly within our specialty and care services portfolio, as well as our pharmacy benefit service business. Evernorth\u2019s strong overall growth reflects the continued demand for our services as we continue investing in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. Cigna Healthcare was also continuing their momentum in the quarter. U.S. employer business draws on enterprise capabilities to deliver greater affordability and support healthy outcomes for the benefit of our clients and their employees and families. Of note, we are driving continued solid growth in our select customer segment. Our results demonstrate focus execution and momentum during our peak selling season and continued opportunity for growth in the years ahead. Touching on our Medicare Advantage business, we remain on track to close on our sale of our Medicare business to HCSC in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to expect to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase. I would note that our Medicare business is performing in line with expectations and we're pleased with the overall value of our offerings, including our nationwide enrollment weighted average will again be four stars for 2025. Going forward, our focus will be on further growing our Evernorth chassis to continue to serve Medicare lives. Overall, our quarterly results reflect clear strategy and strong execution resulting in attractive results. Now stepping back, I want to take a moment to comment on recent headlines and speculation around our company. And while we don't comment on media rumors, we believe that it is important to provide additional context during these unprecedented times. First, there is no question that the industry is highly disrupted. For example, the Medicare Advantage market is particularly challenged given a number of factors, including elevated medical costs, a significant change in SARS ratings for many, and a reset of the risk-adjusted revenue streams. These and other forces are contributing to operational disruption for some as well. As I noted, we don't comment on rumors. But what I will do is be very clear on the actions we are pursuing. We continue to deploy our excess free cash flow for share repurchase, with repurchases totaling $5.7 billion year-to-date, including over $715 million in October. Looking forward, we expect to continue to actively repurchase our shares in the fourth quarter, further leveraging our remaining repurchase capacity, which stands at $5.6 billion. Now I want to transition and cover several actions we are driving in the third quarter and throughout 2024 that address the forces of change that are reshaping the face of healthcare, while we continue to position our company for growth for the benefit of our clients, our customers, and our patients. The first is the pace and rate of pharmacological innovation, and it continues to surge. Many of the treatments coming to market are meaningful in extending and improving quality of lives, for example, through new gene therapies and breakthrough treatments, but they are pressuring affordability given the high list price for manufacturers. Evernorth\u2019s specialty pharmacy business, Accredo, is continuing its strong growth trajectory given both the secular tailwinds and our differentiated strengths, which make us the market leader in the space. The opportunity in biosimilars is a good example of how we are leading the way in providing more value. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. And we're pleased that biosimilar penetration was approximately one-third among eligible accredited patients in the quarter. Building on that success, several weeks ago we announced that we will begin offering an interchangeable to Stelara Biosimilar in 2025. Like Humira Biosimilar, it will be available for a $0 out of pocket for eligible Accredo patients, which drives savings for individuals as well as clients. Another example of our leadership is the GLP-1 drug class, which is on pace to be the number one drug trend driver for plants this year. Now, they're expensive with manufacturers' list price of approximately $15,000 a year. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit service business, the EnCircle Rx solution provides a clinical program wrapper around the medication to help to support sustainable and positive lifestyle changes for patients, as well as improve affordability and access for clients. I'm pleased to share that in the quarter, EnCircle has already grown to almost 8 million lives now enrolled. The pace of change in the pharmacological industry is also why we continue to proactively address misconceptions and misinformation around the pharmacy benefits industry. This is vital to ensure that patients and individuals continue to maintain access to affordable, high-quality prescriptions. Earlier this month, Dr. Dennis Carlton, Professor of Economics Emeritus from the University of Chicago and former DOJ economists released a comprehensive review of the PVM industry. Dr. Carlton's research was conducted over 16-months and drew from multiple sources, including analysis of approximately 20 billion 30-day equivalent prescriptions. The finding of Dr. Carlton\u2019s research in direct contradiction with the FTC's report concludes that PBMs lower high drug prices by fostering competition among [tribal] (ph) drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs facilitate broader access to generic medications in addition to name brand alternatives, which lower costs. And importantly, PBM support independent pharmacies with higher reimbursement rates than chains. And the number of independent pharmacies is increasing. We will leverage Dr. Carlton's study as we continue to engage in fact-based discussions about these critical issues. Moving to the second rapidly changing trend, the increased need for quality behavioral services, which is in part driven by geopolitical, economic, social dynamic tensions that are unfolding around the globe. For context, in the past five years, we've seen overhaul behavioral therapy utilization nearly double. Now in the same period, we worked to increase services and access, for example, adding almost 270,000 providers to our network, assessing the needs of those with lower complexity issues and offering new coaching programs, and implementing online scheduling and access with appointments guaranteed within 72 hours, which millions of Cigna Healthcare customers can now pursue. This is another example of how our businesses have complementary capabilities as we leverage behavioral health innovations and services from Evernorth and embed them into Cigna Healthcare Solutions. The final trend that I will touch on is technology-enabled innovations. We're only beginning to see the start of profound changes as emerging technologies such as AI-powered diagnostics and treatments will drive vast improvements including more personalized care. Another example is the ongoing adoption of virtual services which is rapidly rising with about 25% of patients accessing care through telehealth services last year in the U.S. This far exceeds the 5% or fewer who accessed care this way prior to the pandemic. We continue to advance in this area with our telehealth platform MDLIVE. We have offered MDLIVE for our customers since its acquisition in 2021. And last month we took another step forward with patients that have lower health risk issues enabling them to get fast, flexible care without a phone call or video call, whenever and wherever they want, with MDLIVE physicians via an online portal. And patients typically are able to receive treatment within one hour. At the Cigna Group, we're built to create and capture value from these forces of change for the benefit of those we serve. Next, I'll transition to provide some context relative to the tailwinds and headwinds we anticipate for 2025. Now we'll provide detailed guidance as we always do during our fourth quarter call. With the strength of our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we expect to both finish 2024 strong and for 2025 to have another year of competitively attractive performance. Some notable tailwinds include our continued ramp-up of biosimilar offerings, continued advancement of new client relationships, and EPS accretion from the divestiture of our Medicare business, specifically the impact of share repurchase from the sales proceeds. Now turning to headwinds, we expect lower net investment income as we will no longer recognize the dividend from our VillageMD investment. We anticipate some stranded overhead from the sale of our Medicare Advantage business, which we will mitigate over time. And we will make continued strategic investments across our portfolio to drive sustained innovation and position ourselves for long-term growth. Considering all the puts and takes, we expect another strong year of growth in 2025 with EPS growth of at least 10%, which is consistent with our historical approach when we start the year with appropriate prudence. Now I'll briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. Building on our momentum, our focus in discipline third-quarter execution positions us to meet our full-year 2024 and long-term growth targets. The Cigna group has earned a reputation for delivering differentiated value for those we serve and driving new innovation in ways that lead the industry. Our ability to consistently do this year-after-year is directly attributable to the strength of our leadership team and the passion and commitment of our 70,000 colleagues worldwide. And the deliberate structure of our company, which is designed with growth platforms capable of navigating even the most dynamic environments. As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered on our financial commitments with adjusted EPS of $7.51, and we remain on track to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.40 in 2024. Our company has attractive and sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term and we remain confident in delivering our continued average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 14% on average, building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS on a compound growth rate over the past decade. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to share additional perspective on our performance for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nBrian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review Cigna's third quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full-year. During the year where the environment has been highly disrupted and dynamic, we're pleased with another quarter of strong results, highlighting our consistent execution and delivering against our prior commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter include revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. These results, combined with our breadth of capabilities in diverse portfolio businesses, reinforce our confidence in our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing more than 13% year-over-year growth. Now turning to our segment results, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by consistent execution across our businesses with particularly significant growth within our specialty and care services business in the third quarter. Total Evernorth revenues for third quarter 2024 grew to $52.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 9% to $1.9 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. This growth came despite a $33 million headwind to net investment income related to the absence of the VillageMD dividend. Our strong Evernorth results reflect our continued execution amidst the ongoing long-term trend of pharmacological innovation. With rising clinical needs, the introduction of new therapies to the market, and more availability of biosimilars, Evernorth is well positioned to assist patients and clients in navigating these trends. Moving to our businesses within Evernorth, specialty and care services revenue of $23.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $825 million both grew 23% in the quarter, a significant acceleration in year-over-year growth when compared to the first-half of 2024. While we had expected strong contributions in the quarter, this performance was above expectations, reflecting growth across our specialty businesses driven by more rapid uptake of specialty medications. Additionally, the quarter also benefited from increased adoption of Humira biosimilars. The increased adoption benefits both patients through lower out-of-pocket costs, as well as clients through lower net costs. And in the quarter, we saw approximately one-third of eligible Humira scripts transition to biosimilars. As we have highlighted, we are the leader in the specialty market. We are confident in delivering long-term profitable growth, given the pipeline of new drug innovation and our decades of experience in the space, as we've established a differentiated business model with proven, superior clinical outcomes for complex, high-cost conditions. Pharmacy benefit services also posted robust revenue growth driven by the addition of new business wins, expansion of existing relationships, and continued demand for new drugs through our innovative products and solutions. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased to $1 billion as our differentiated capabilities continue to drive affordability and value to our patients, customers, and clients. Overall, Evernorth delivered results slightly above expectations, even while absorbing the aforementioned net investment income headwind. And we continue to expect accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. Regarding Cigna Healthcare, third quarter 2024 revenues were $13.3 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 82.8%. The medical care ratio was in line with expectations. As we have discussed, we planned and priced for elevated trend coming into the year. During the quarter, we did observe elevated trends in specialty medications in our Cigna Healthcare book. This is consistent with the higher volumes we saw in our specialty and care business within Evernorth and speaks to the balance of our well-diversified portfolio, which we intentionally created to position our company for some of the highest growth secular tailwinds in healthcare. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating consistent, steady execution in a dynamic environment. Now turning to our outlook for full-year 2024. Given the strength and diversity of our portfolio, we have the confidence to reaffirm our full-year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40. Moving to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms, in Evernorth we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects a continued acceleration of earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by strength and specialty volumes and increasing adoption of Humira biosimilars, as well as the continued advancement of new client relationships. This is partially offset by lower expected net investment income. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion. And we are maintaining our full-year medical care ratio outlook of 81.7% to 82.5%, although we now expect to be toward the high-end of the range due to the aforementioned increase in specialty medication utilization, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter. We expect the impact of the higher fourth quarter MCR to be offset by other levers within Cigna Healthcare, such as operating efficiency. Turning to our 2024 capital management position, we remain confident in our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation due to our efficient asset-like strategy that delivers attractive returns on capital. I would note that timing-related items impacted third quarter cash flow from operations. We are anticipating a meaningful step up in cash flow in the fourth quarter, and our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with our long-term framework. Regarding share repurchase, year-to-date through October 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 16.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.7 billion, including our repurchase of $715 million in the month of October alone. We continue to expect additional share repurchase in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our confidence in the strength and sustainable growth of our business. Now to recap, strong results through the first three quarters of the year give us confidence to deliver on our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing over 13% year-over-year growth toward the higher end of our long-term average adjusted EPS growth target range. As David mentioned, we look forward to providing our 2025 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. We are confident in delivering another year of competitively differentiated EPS growth of at least 10%, consistent with our historical approach where we start the year with appropriate prudence. The ability to consistently meet our financial commitments is a testament to our team executing to drive value for our clients and customers and our portfolio of complementary businesses that we've strategically positioned for strong, stable, and sustainable long-term growth. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of AJ Rice with UBS. Your line is open.\nAJ Rice: Thanks, hi everybody. Maybe I'll just ask about two things here. One, you obviously had a little bit of an elevated commercial trend this year, but you said all year long that you were able to price for it and anticipate it? I wonder at this early date as you look out to \u201825, are you assuming more of the same? Are you getting any pushback from employers on taking that approach if you are, again? And then on the VillageMD, I know you'd laid out a strategy for working with them as one of the ways that Evernorth could address the primary care market. Obviously, that situation's in flux. I wonder if there's any pivots the company's considering and how important putting something in place with respect to physician groups, particularly primary care, it is for the overall Evernorth strategy.\nDavid Cordani: Good morning, AJ, it's David. Let me ask Brian to take your first question relative to trend \u201824 and \u201825, and then I'll provide a little call around Village and specifically our value-based care strategy and where we go from here. Brian?\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, AJ. So first off, we're very pleased with the strength of our U.S. employer business within Cigna Healthcare. That business continues to perform well for us. And as a reminder, our U.S. employer book is nearly 85% ASO or self-funded, which includes earning levers that go well beyond the peer risk-based MCR. That said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within our target margin ranges here in 2024. As it relates to the external market to your point on employers, we characterize the environment as competitive but rational, and we've remained disciplined with our own pricing strategy in this environment. As it relates to 2025, we do expect cost trends to remain elevated above historical levels, and we're pricing for 2025 rate increases that are greater than what we achieved in 2024, given that continued elevated cost trend expectation, the firm competitive environment, as well as our desire to preserve our margin levels. So David, I'll turn it over to you to talk about the Village piece.\nDavid Cordani: Sure. AJ, so relative to Village, you brought up part of your question, talks about the strategy. So stepping back first and foremost, VBC, Value-Based Care, from our point of view is how do we align incentives, leverage information, and then leverage clinical resources and extenders to deliver improved overall quality and ultimately value. Within our Cigna Healthcare platform, that's done day in, day out for collaborative accountable care relationships, and those relationships continue to evolve. Those are partnered relationships, leverage relationships that we drive forward. Increasingly, some of Evernorth's capabilities are in support of that. Second, specific to the VillageMD relationship, we sought to accelerate that through our Evernorth Accountable Care relationship for lives and patients outside of those that were within our program and chassis on the benefit side of the equation. And in hindsight, the timing of that, given the disruptions at the marketplace, including the risk-adjusted disruption and some of the cash flow disruption from some of the underlying investors proved to be poorly timed. Moving forward from an Evernorth standpoint, the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships will continue to probe and identify where and how we can expand relationships. I would note that we do continue to make very good progress of deepening relationships with healthcare professionals out of Evernorth, specifically off of our CuraScript capabilities that could use to grow meaningfully. But we will continue to take a paced path with the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships currently given the disruption, again, meaningfully caused by the change in the risk adjuster environment. Thanks, AJ.\nAJ Rice: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First, I want to follow-up on, David, your comments around capital deployment and some of the rumors out there in the market. Just to be clear, do you, you talked a lot about the share repurchase in 2024, which has been significant. The fourth quarter, the proceeds, are you -- the last time we had this discussion, you also talked about a forward year and where you kind of saw the predominance of capital going as well. Are you also saying -- or did I miss that you were going to talk about that you are going to deploy capital to share repurchase or the vast majority of the share repurchase in 2025 as well? And then just on the business, can you give us some more color on what's going on in Specialty? There have been a few companies talking about that. What do you think is driving that? And any other specifics you can give us, we'd appreciate.\nDavid Cordani: Justin, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question, and then I'll ask Eric to give you, I think your broader second question is relative to what's transpired in the Specialty space. So first, to the specific part of your question, you didn't miss anything I communicated. We've not provided detailed guidance for 2025. We'll provide more comprehensive guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter call and we look forward to doing so. Second, stepping back, as I noted in my prepared remarks, given the disruption in the space, we wanted to ensure that we had as much information out there and the clarity of put forth. I'd ask maybe to step back and reflect for a moment. If you think about to the core of your question, what we've done, our actions that both Brian and I reinforced meaningful share repurchase in 2024, which has been on a repurchasing through the month of October and expect it to continue to repurchase in the fourth quarter. If you reflect back on the last four years, we've repurchased about $24 billion of our stock, right? That was strategically guided as we were harnessing the benefit of the combination. We did have some divestitures within the context of that and as we leverage the broad cash flow generation of our asset-light portfolio and capabilities. So I would ask you to stay tuned for more comprehensive 2025 guidance, but reflect on our disciplined track record of being a good steward of capital and demonstrating the ability to create real sustained shareholder value in the way we deploy capital. Eric, I'll ask you to talk about the Specialty space.\nEric Palmer: Great. Thanks, David. And good morning, Justin, it's Eric. As we find at our Investor Day earlier this year, the Specialty market is a $400 billion market and growing. And we're leaders in this space, driven by our focused condition-specific model, our clinical expertise and our overall geographic reach. And this positions us well to be helpful to our clients across the board, whether it's health plans, employers, health systems and the like. Now specific to this quarter, this was the first full quarter where we dispensed our biosimilar Humira. And additionally, we had some expansion with existing clients choosing to move more business to Accredo. And we had broad-based volume strength as well. And I'd call out therapies for inflammatory conditions, for oncology and neurology as areas with particularly strong growth in the quarter. With respect to the 23% growth in the quarter, we've noted in the past that the results in any given quarter is going to depend on the timing of new volumes, new customers, new therapies being available and so on. But over time, we expect this market to be a meaningful part of the growth of our enterprise. We've talked about our Specialty and Care Solutions space growing at 8% to 12% on a sustained annual basis. And all of these factors are built into our assessment there. So we continue to be well positioned in this market and quite excited about the opportunities to serve the market to grow and to serve our patients. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRyan Langston: Hi, thank you. I think in the prepared remarks, you said you had 8 million lives now on the EnCircleRx program. My understanding is that was only -- I say only about 3 million to 5 million only just a couple of months ago. That seems like incredibly strong growth and demand. I guess, what's driving that? And I guess, where do we see that pick up moving over the next couple of years, just given it seems in the past couple of months, that's risen pretty dramatically?\nEric Palmer: Good morning, Ryan, it's Eric. Thanks the question. As you can imagine, there's real interest in need from our clients is they're looking for help with managing the affordability of GLP-1s and these conditions overall. We're really excited about the opportunity to bring this first of its kind solution to the market. And as David noted, I think you said we're almost at 8 million lives. So not quite there yet, but approaching it rapidly. We launched this program just a handful of months ago. And as we've talked about previously, it targets the right patient population, working to bring the relevant clinical markers and engage patients with the support they need to help make changes that make the impact last, provides a guaranteed clinical comes to our clients and provides a strong overall return for the investment in the program. Performance so far is that the solution is working well. The early results, our clients are enrolled. They're seeing significant savings and reductions in trends compared to those who are not enrolled as we mature the process or mature the data, we'll have more to report here. David, maybe any other perspective you want to share?\nDavid Cordani: Sure. Thanks. I'll just amplify two points. As we all spend a significant amount of time in the market, we're a field-based organization. This is typically a top one, two or three topic with clients, with brokers, with consultants and with others in the market. So as we noted, GLP-1s remain front and center. The specific piece I would add, though, is as the market continues to absorb the challenges of affordability, the market also is observing and clients are observing and physicians are observing the start and stop dynamic that is transpiring for some patients, which also doesn't generate the desired or intended outcome if a patient starts on a regimen and stops in eight months and then maybe starts up and then maybe stops as well. So folks are really -- the value proposition really resonates relative to the clinical wrappers, the care wrappers, the coaching wrappers, the behavioral support wrappers that exist in the value-based care nature of the underlying program. So I appreciate you calling out the growth because it is significant and it underscores the need for innovation that we lead as these new treatments come to market.\nRyan Langston: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much. Good morning. Can you maybe talk about the 2025 selling season on the PBM side? I'm just really curious around a few things. One, as we have more biosimilars, are we seeing a change in the economics of how contracts are formulated going into 2025? And then just as a follow-up, David, you highlighted the FTC report and the report that the University of Chicago professors looked at. Is there any update on potential legislation or anything you're seeing from a state perspective that potentially is using some of this information when they're thinking about legislation?\nDavid Cordani: Lisa, it's David. Let me ask Eric to start with the Evernorth selling season, including the PBM dynamic and what's transpiring and then I'll address your FTC question.\nEric Palmer: Thanks, David. Lisa, fundamentally, we start with a portfolio that's equipped to offer choice and flexibility in how we work to support our clients. We work to make the pharmacy benefit accessible for the patient and more affordable, and we continue to innovate to bring new ways to the market to do that. And stepping back, Evernorth is well positioned to continue to grow. The strength of those innovations and our solutions continue to resonate. And just as we talked about the growth EnCircleRx, we continue to have growth in our various innovative programs. Now specifically with respect to the pharmacy benefit services business for 2025, we had a good 2025 selling season, and our retention rate continues to be consistent with recent years in the mid- to high-90s percent range. We're driving meaningful innovations, whether it's EnCircleRx, our oncology benefit services are just recent examples. And we're positioned for another good year in 2025. As far as change, again, I'd say there's good interest in discussing what services, what financing arrangements are going to best align with our clients' needs, but I wouldn't call out any wholesale or substantial change in terms of what our customers and clients are actually purchasing from us. David?\nDavid Cordani: This is relative to the FTC, I think the end of your question really pointed toward legislation, but let me just pull back for a moment. First and foremost, and you know the space extremely well, right? PBM and pharmacy benefit service industry exists to create real, sustained differentiated value through improved affordability, through expanding access to services that are more affordable like generics, through patient coordination and clinical coordination programs, which are especially critical for the chronic and polychronic population. And as a validation of the value we deliver, our client retention levels reinforce that with historic client retention levels in the 95% plus range. And as we look to the year ahead in 2025, it being even at the higher end of that range. And secondly, as we've talked about, whether it's through EnCircleRx, through the biosimilars, our ability to continue to lead the market with innovations that deliver more value especially with new treatments coming to market is mission-critical. Specific to the FTC report, let me be really clear. We disagree on the unfounded assertions that were put forth. Second, the clear direction that was put forth by Dr. Carlton's report is in direct contrast to that. And going forward, we will engage in fact-based conversations. As it relates specifically to legislation, we do not see any specific fully mature proposed legislation right now that looks like it will be put forward. Obviously, there's a bit more time left in the year. There's no doubt relative to that. We remain actively engaged. I was in Washington on Monday of this week on a variety of topics. We remain actively engaged. But I think most importantly, at capping it off, we're confident in the durability of our model, our proven ability to partner, our proven ability to drive ongoing innovation to make sure we are able to continue to grow and deliver the value, both in the pharmacy benefit service space as well as in the specialty space.\nLisa Gill: Great. Thanks for the comments, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. You called out planned investments across both core PBM and specialty in the release, and it sounds like that will continue into 2025. Can you give us a little bit more detail on the nature and magnitude of those investments? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Andrew, it's Brian. So as we intend to do in any year, we have a fair amount of our discretionary capital that goes back into internal reinvestments. So when we talk about the continued investment in the business, not just in the Evernorth platform, but also in Cigna Healthcare, that's a core part of our capital deployment framework before we start talking about capital being returned to shareholders. So this year, we're tracking to, call it, $1.5 billion or so of discretionary CapEx, and that's kind of over and above the core administrative expenses, which are round numbers about $20 billion that we spend in the year. So most of that will go toward technology going forward, so that some of that customer patient-facing technology. Some of that is provider-facing technology, and some of that is a broker or field-facing technology as well. So the majority of when you think about our discretionary CapEx is headed in that direction. And as we think about the long-term growth opportunity we have, for example, in the specialty space, which is already a $400 billion addressable market growing at the secular high-single-digit type rate. We see opportunities to continue strengthening our capabilities there to make ourselves even more relevant. So think of it as primarily technology, and we gear that up or down in any given year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Thanks so much. I wanted to dig into specialty a bit more. It just sounds like you're seeing the traction with the Humira biosimilar strategy. Just how would you compare that to the strategy around products like Stelara and the ramp you expect with Stelara relative to what you saw with Humira and other biosimilars that are coming down the pipe? I guess, how do you think about the cadence of that opportunity over the next several years but also just in terms of 2025 from an LOE perspective? Thanks.\nEric Palmer: Hi, Erin, it's Eric. I appreciate the question. Stepping back, I think the model that we've built here and that we've deployed around our biosimilar Humira has provided another good choice in the market, and it's one that we think we're well positioned to replicate in the appropriate situations going forward. As David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we will be launching a no out-of-pocket cost alternative to Stelara in 2025. And I could envision us using this playbook and approach for additional biosimilars as we look ahead into the coming years. We've noted at our Investor Day earlier this year that we see nearly half of the specialty market having biosimilar alternatives choice available in terms of bringing new affordability to the market. And this is one example of a strategy that will help to improve the affordability and the accessibility of these medicines for the patients that need them and for the plan sponsors that are funding them. So every different therapy will have a different alternatives, they will have different kind of adoption of paths based off of the clinical needs of the patients being served based off of the break and pace of availability of products and such. But at a macro level, we're really well positioned to continue to lead in this market and bring new solutions to market just like we did with the biosimilar Humira, like we are in the process of doing with Stelara and like we'll do with other drugs coming after that. David?\nDavid Cordani: Erin, just one point I want to add to Eric's comment relative to the specialty market specifically, and maybe it's a statement of the obvious, but when we operate in an environment of elevated medical cost pressure which the industry is seeing in a broader sense, you could also think about the high-performing nature in this case, of our specialty capabilities, both through Accredo as well as through CuraScript, in some ways, provides us a natural or structured hedge against the medical cost pressure that is natural to manifest itself on the benefit side of the equation. So when we talk about the conscious way, we've structured the corporation, we've structured it, obviously, with different addressable markets. We've structured it with an asset-light framework. But in this case, also highlighting the structure provides some natural hedge when inflationary pressure or utilization pressure manifests on one side, it also provides growth opportunity and value capture opportunities on the other side of our very diverse portfolio. So I just wanted to punctuate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question if I could try to do a two-part or would be one, just on the cost trend side, maybe if you could just drill in a little bit, give us an update on the inpatient side as well in terms of what you've been seeing there relative to expectations recently. And then I did want to get your perspective just on the competitive environment for the exchanges in 2025. It looks like from our analysis of the CMS landscape data for the federal exchange is that we do see a number of the major carriers with actually negative rates in their same-store plans for 2025. So it does seem like the competitive framework has intensified quite a bit. And so I'm certainly interested in your perspective right now on that market category as well? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Scott, it's Brian. I'll take both of your questions here. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance within Cigna Healthcare with the overall performance in line with expectations, as I noted earlier. And just as a reminder, we had planned and price for the overall elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. And within the quarter specifically, we had a range of affordability initiatives that proved to be beneficial to the MCR, and it had some offset to the uptick I mentioned in specialty drug utilization in the quarter. And where we saw that most notably was, we saw some deceleration in cost trends in surgical activity in particular. You asked about inpatient. Inpatient was broadly in line with our expectations in the quarter. So I wouldn't flag that as a particular hotspot or an area of favorability. And as David said, we're fortunate to have the natural hedge at the enterprise level where the elevated customer demand for specialty drugs resulted in the favorable performance, we saw in our Evernorth business, specifically within the specialty and care services platform. As it relates to the individual exchanges, so we continue to see this market as being an important subsegment of the U.S. health care system for those who don't have access to employer or government-sponsored coverages. We've been a consistent player in this market over the past decade since the ACA went into effect. And for us, 2024 has been a year focused on margin expansion in our individual exchange business. And that approach is playing out largely as we expected here with fewer customers in 2024, but carrying a higher profit margin profile compared to our 2023 experience. As it relates to 2025, specifically, as you noted, the weighted average rate increase for our customer base is in the low double digits, which based on the publicly available information is on the higher end of the competitive set. That said, there's a considerable variation by geography when you dig into that. And for us, the exact margin profile and customer volumes will be a function of geographic mix and competitor behavior in each of those different geographies. But taken all together, we continue to invest in this business, see it as a growth engine for the company and over time, look forward to 10% to 15% annualized growth here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Ron with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAdam Ron: Hey, thanks for the question. I also wanted to dig into the specialty comments. But from the managed care side, you mentioned that it was the reason that you're increasing your MLR guidance. And I know that you still do currently own the Medicare Advantage company. That also has the Part D business. And so wondering if you could delineate like the pressure that you're seeing in specialty between the Medicare side and the commercial side. And on the Medicare side, if you think it's being driven by the IRA at all? Thanks.\nBrian Evanko: Good morning, Adam, it's Brian. I'll start. If you my colleagues want to pile on, you're welcome to. So as it relates to what we saw in Cigna Healthcare on the Specialty drug side, really, the uptick in the utilization was broad-based across most of our Accredo therapeutic resource centers in the third quarter. In particular, we saw it in inflammatory conditions, oncology and neurology. And really this transpired across all the Cigna Healthcare product lines, Commercial Employer, Medicare and the individual exchanges. The Medicare volumes were slightly more elevated than commercial, but not enough that we would flag it as having a different root cause, and we do not see the IRA is having driven a meaningful amount of the third quarter experience. And as I said earlier, I'm pleased to have the natural hedge with the Evernorth Specialty business benefiting from those increased volumes in the quarter.\nDavid Cordani: And Brian, the only thing I would add is, Adam, to your broader question, as noted in our opening comments, but by and large, the Medicare Advantage portfolio of our business is performing in line with our expectations as we build the plan out for the course of the year. So Brian's reference is on the margin in terms of the elevation there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, good morning, guys. And David, I kind of want to come back to the -- your comments on the Medicare Advantage market that you opened up the call with, which is in the past, you kind of said that MA is a strategically important market with a lot of long-term value. And on this call, you're saying it's a challenged market. So first, I guess, number one is kind of can you help me bridge the gap between those two lines of thoughts? And then as you look at the MA market from where you sit, given that you guys still participate, do you see its challenges as cyclical or structural?\nDavid Cordani: George, my comments relative to the marketplace are our view, a statement of fact, given the current environment, drawing back to your broader point of view, we see from a societal standpoint, MA as currently and in the future, an important part of the offering to the marketplace. So it would be very clear. Secondly, as we've discussed before, within our Evernorth portfolio today, fully approaching one-third of all of our product programs and services face off against government-sponsored programs, very inclusive of MA and the supporting programs are on MA and we will continue to invest in and grow those programs, products and services. What I was seeking to draw back to was, again, given the disruption in the marketplace and the headline that we were drawn into great clarity that the marketplace is disrupted and our actions and our behaviors are consistent with what we said they were going to be specifically using our discretionary free cash flow for share repurchase. Looking forward, I would expect to see the MA marketplace find its footing again, albeit it's going to go through a choppy phase right now for the forces I talked about before, elevated medical costs. Significant reset the stars. So if you look back, there was a time when the marketplace had almost 90% of all lives in four-star plus plans that gets reset down to 60% plus of lives. That's a large resetting for the marketplace. The risk adjuster part of the program coming through is also quite meaningful. So I deem it to be transitional for the marketplace. The leaders in the marketplace will find a way to lead through this. And importantly, MA serves a very important value prop from a societal standpoint. On average, an MA life as lower income on average in MA life is supportive of better clinical coordination, clinical efficacy and an average in MA life is getting better overall value and affordability. The space is just going through a choppy time right now, and that's what we're trying to call attention to.\nGeorge Hill: I appreciate the color, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. So I'll harp on those. I'll sort of keep on the topic here. But just in terms of the cadence of buybacks, I want to understand you guys were relatively strong in the first quarter, particularly strong in the second quarter. A noticeable pause in 3Q, and I heard David, your response to Justin's question around this disruption in the space and wanting to get as much clarity as possible. Should we assume that you now have the clarity that you need to understand the Medicare Advantage business and that is what's leading to this reacceleration in the buybacks and into 2025? And then just a smaller one, just on favorable development, it was a little larger in 3Q. Could you talk were there any specific drivers of that or areas where development came in better?\nDavid Cordani: Josh, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question and then ask Brian to take the second part of your questions. No. If the specific answer to your question, the call -- the cadence of our buybacks is driven by cash flow timing. So you'll note that our cash flow, and we've highlighted this in the past, doesn't happen ratably throughout the course of the year. So early part of the year, we expected to have significant deployment of capital and toward the latter part of the year, we expect to have significant deployment of capital. So specific to your question, the timing and cadence of deployment of free cash flow is tied to the timing of the cash flow generation in the fourth quarter will be a high cash flow generation quarter for us. And we highlighted the fact that we are quite active in the marketplace, noting the share repurchase through the month of October thus far. Brian, can I ask you to take the second part of the question?\nBrian Evanko: Sure, David. So as it relates to the prior year development that we saw in the third quarter, it was a little bit higher than we typically would see in the third quarter. But Important to keep in mind that, that's gross prior year development, which doesn't translate one for one to a net P&L impact, just given the variety of factors like client sharing, MLR rebate impacts and other items. And in any given period, we tend to see a fluctuation as you can appreciate, in reserve development from year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. And overall, the net P&L effect of prior period reserve development was not a significant driver of the Cigna Healthcare MCO or the Cigna Healthcare income in the third quarter. So I appreciate the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lance, your line is open. You may need to unmute yourself.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks so much. Just a couple of cleanup questions and one broad strategic question. On the strategic level, as you're looking at deployment of capital as you're thinking about inorganic moves, how do you look at things from a management and board level with respect to management stability, stability and volatility of a business model, et cetera? And are there other important criteria\u2019s we should be aware of? And the little items are just over in the employer market, given high premium inflation, are you seeing different behaviors from employers whether that's faster shift to ASO or certain types of cost containment features that they're looking for? Thanks.\nDavid Cordani: Lance, good morning, it's David. Let me take your strategic question specific to M&A criteria and then ask Brian to take your follow-up. You painted a mis-cleanup. I find that interesting. But specific to your strategic question, if you step back and think about our M&A criteria, which is the core of your question, our criteria has not changed. And to remind you, first is strategic alignment. Then second is financial attractiveness. I'll come back to that in a moment. And then third is our need to see a clear path to close. As it relates to financial attractiveness, we take into consideration EPS accretion. So the level of, the timing of, the visibility of, the durability of. We also look at capital efficiency, return on invested capital on a relative basis in terms of assessing it. So to the core of your question, if I heard you correctly, a more disruptive environment or a less stable asset would increase the beta. Increasing the beta requires a higher visibility to highly durable synergies, value capture and the durability of that. So to the core of your question is, of course, we have to consider that because you're looking for strategic value creation and strategic value capture. And adjacency versus further adjacency and the more stable and predictable versus the more volatile has to be taken into consideration. And I'll end with, I believe we have a very clear, good track record of applying these criteria and creating shareholder value over a long period of time. Brian, I'll transition you?\nBrian Evanko: Yes. Lance, on the second question in terms of how employers are reacting to a higher cost trend environment, a few things highlight there from our U.S. employer portfolio. Affordability is generally the number one topic when we talk to employer clients. And historically, they look at benefit buy-downs, changes to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums maybe premium contribution changes. But the strategies are becoming more precise and more granular now. So as an example, we're seeing more and more interest in our specialty pharmacy capabilities, programs like the EnCircleRx to help mitigate GLP-1 spending and ensure clinical appropriateness of all those programs. So we're seeing interest in more precise affordability programs. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our mental health and substance of these capabilities. Since the pandemic started, this has been a higher cost trend category. And even this year, it's contributing about 1% to employer cost trends just in the year. So there's interest in what programs and services we have available to address that as well as the link between mental and physical health, which has been shown, metal health utilization deflects physical health needs down the line. And then finally, there's interest in more precise provider network configurations that help to optimize cost, quality incentive alignment. So things like our Pathwell Specialty offerings, things like our Pathway Bone & Joint program, so all those things are of increased interest to employers in a high trend environment. And taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address those themes.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Ha with Baird. Your line is open.\nMichael Ha: Hi, thank you. So firstly, on '25 headwinds and tailwinds, thank you for providing that list in your prepared remarks. I was just wondering if you could maybe flesh that out a bit more specifically, which of those building blocks perhaps are you most confident about in terms of helping you on your path to 10% or at least 10% EPS growth next year? And then following up on Erin's question, maybe a different approach to it. I know biosimilar quickly rose to 20% share of your specialty book last quarter. Where has that trended in third quarter? Where do you see both HUMIRA biosimilar adoption, which I believe is now one-third of eligible and that biosimilars share, especially by trending into year-end and over the next year. And then as I think about Evernorth's earnings growth, I think you mentioned last quarter that biosimilars is going to help drive it to high single-digit growth in third quarter, which you did. So I wanted to get your thoughts on how are we now in a spot where it can sustainably grow high single digits going forward, are we officially now in that sort of new paradigm of earnings contribution Evernorth from biosimilars? Thank you.\nDavid Cordani: Michael, good morning, it's David. You packed a lot in there for us to begin to bring our call to a close in short order, but important topics. So first, let me just frame a little bit of the headwind tailwind framework and then ask Brian to peel it back, although it will give you a bit more specificity. And then we'll transition to Eric, who will talk about the trends in direction, et cetera. I don't think we're declaring a new normal as opposed to the growth trajectory we see relative to that business in the 8% to 12% compounded over time, which is above the secular trends. But let me shift back to the headwind tailwind. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we'll provide much more detail in our fourth quarter call as we provide the 2025 outlook and guidance as we always do. Importantly, and we want to stress, this will come off of 2024, which is going to be another strong year and competitively differentiated year. And our outlook for 2025 will be a strong year and competitively differentiated year. And we highlighted several of the headwinds and tailwinds as you put them all together, even at this point, we're confident to step forward and say that our growth algorithm will be intact for 2025, yet we would expect to guide at the lower end of our algorithm range with taking a posture prudence. So Brian, could I ask you to give a little bit more color on some of the drivers within the headwinds and tailwinds and some dimensioning?\nBrian Evanko: Sure, David. Michael, I'll give you maybe a little bit more detail on the three tailwinds and three headwinds that David outlined earlier on the call. So in terms of the three tailwinds we see for 2025, continued biosimilar adoption is one. Obviously, that's been a theme throughout the morning here, and we do have a high degree of confidence in that being delivered in 2025. Secondly, we expect advancements in our large PBS client relationships. Obviously, we had a very sizable new client in '24. We also have others that we've onboard in recent years. And then the third tailwind is EPS accretion from the deployment of the Medicare sale proceeds. And given we know the magnitude of this, we would expect this to be a low single-digit percent impact on 2025 EPS when you think about the deployment of those proceeds. That's offset by three primary headwinds that we see at this juncture. The first is the absence of the 2025 VillageMD dividend recognition. So as I made reference to earlier, that was $33 million in the third quarter. You annualize that out. It's about $130 million of a headwind for 2025 to the Evernorth segment income as well as, obviously, the enterprise. Secondly, we'll have some stranded overhead from the Medicare divestiture, which is currently at about $150 million for the year. And you can think of that as split roughly half and half between Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. And obviously, our teams will work to whittle that down over time, but we see that as about $150 million headwind for '25. And then finally, continued investments for long-term growth, as I made reference to an earlier question, that will gear up or gear down depending on the market opportunities that we see as we balance short-term and long-term needs for the company. So Eric, you can pile on here on the biosimilars part of the question?\nEric Palmer: Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Michael. With respect to HUMIRA, a couple of notes I wanted just to be clear on, we began to spend in a biosimilar HUMIRA at the end of June. We noted in our second quarter call that throughout the month of July, had achieved about 20% -- or about 20% of our customers had elected to use the biosimilar HUMIRA. And that's grown throughout the quarter. The number we provided today was that across the third quarter in its entirety now about 33% of the eligible patients had adopted. So really nice growth throughout the quarter. We would expect that to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And to your more macro question, just I'll step back for a minute. We're well positioned to bring value to the benefit of our customers and clients overall. And as we've noted for several years now, we see and have worked to deliberately position ourselves to be lined up to capture the forces associated with pharmacological innovation and we've positioned our company to play a leading role in connecting patients with the medicines that they need there. At our Investor Day back in March, we again increased the top end of our long-term growth range for Evernorth up to 5% to 8% growth, and that reflects all of these dynamics. And so that's the I think the fourth time we increased the growth trajectory of Evernorth since Evernorth was launched just a few years ago, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow in this space are the same, the positive forces that we've just talked about and the ability to have a meaningful positive influence on affordability of health care and the patients that we serve overall. So we're excited about the opportunity and well positioned to play a leading role here.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani: Thank you. I just want to briefly wrap up. Most importantly, thanks for your questions, your time and your engagement on our call today. Just to highlight a few headlines. Cigna Group once again, given our business momentum and complementary growth platforms delivered a strong third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver our 2024 EPS outlook of at least $20.40, and we're on track for another competitively differentiated year in 2025. Before I close, I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues around the world and a fantastic senior leadership team. It's their focus, caring orientation and commitment that allows us to do what we do day in, day out for those we have the privilege to serve. We're proud of what we've accomplished in the third quarter and the trajectory that we have for the full-year, and we look forward to talking you in the future. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's third quarter 2024 results review.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review Cigna's third quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full-year. During the year where the environment has been highly disrupted and dynamic, we're pleased with another quarter of strong results, highlighting our consistent execution and delivering against our prior commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the third quarter include revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. These results, combined with our breadth of capabilities in diverse portfolio businesses, reinforce our confidence in our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing more than 13% year-over-year growth. Now turning to our segment results, I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by consistent execution across our businesses with particularly significant growth within our specialty and care services business in the third quarter. Total Evernorth revenues for third quarter 2024 grew to $52.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 9% to $1.9 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. This growth came despite a $33 million headwind to net investment income related to the absence of the VillageMD dividend. Our strong Evernorth results reflect our continued execution amidst the ongoing long-term trend of pharmacological innovation. With rising clinical needs, the introduction of new therapies to the market, and more availability of biosimilars, Evernorth is well positioned to assist patients and clients in navigating these trends. Moving to our businesses within Evernorth, specialty and care services revenue of $23.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $825 million both grew 23% in the quarter, a significant acceleration in year-over-year growth when compared to the first-half of 2024. While we had expected strong contributions in the quarter, this performance was above expectations, reflecting growth across our specialty businesses driven by more rapid uptake of specialty medications. Additionally, the quarter also benefited from increased adoption of Humira biosimilars. The increased adoption benefits both patients through lower out-of-pocket costs, as well as clients through lower net costs. And in the quarter, we saw approximately one-third of eligible Humira scripts transition to biosimilars. As we have highlighted, we are the leader in the specialty market. We are confident in delivering long-term profitable growth, given the pipeline of new drug innovation and our decades of experience in the space, as we've established a differentiated business model with proven, superior clinical outcomes for complex, high-cost conditions. Pharmacy benefit services also posted robust revenue growth driven by the addition of new business wins, expansion of existing relationships, and continued demand for new drugs through our innovative products and solutions. Pre-tax adjusted earnings increased to $1 billion as our differentiated capabilities continue to drive affordability and value to our patients, customers, and clients. Overall, Evernorth delivered results slightly above expectations, even while absorbing the aforementioned net investment income headwind. And we continue to expect accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. Regarding Cigna Healthcare, third quarter 2024 revenues were $13.3 billion. Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion and the medical care ratio was 82.8%. The medical care ratio was in line with expectations. As we have discussed, we planned and priced for elevated trend coming into the year. During the quarter, we did observe elevated trends in specialty medications in our Cigna Healthcare book. This is consistent with the higher volumes we saw in our specialty and care business within Evernorth and speaks to the balance of our well-diversified portfolio, which we intentionally created to position our company for some of the highest growth secular tailwinds in healthcare. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered solid results this quarter, demonstrating consistent, steady execution in a dynamic environment. Now turning to our outlook for full-year 2024. Given the strength and diversity of our portfolio, we have the confidence to reaffirm our full-year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40. Moving to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms, in Evernorth we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects a continued acceleration of earnings in the fourth quarter, driven by strength and specialty volumes and increasing adoption of Humira biosimilars, as well as the continued advancement of new client relationships. This is partially offset by lower expected net investment income. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full-year 2024 pre-tax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion. And we are maintaining our full-year medical care ratio outlook of 81.7% to 82.5%, although we now expect to be toward the high-end of the range due to the aforementioned increase in specialty medication utilization, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter. We expect the impact of the higher fourth quarter MCR to be offset by other levers within Cigna Healthcare, such as operating efficiency. Turning to our 2024 capital management position, we remain confident in our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation due to our efficient asset-like strategy that delivers attractive returns on capital. I would note that timing-related items impacted third quarter cash flow from operations. We are anticipating a meaningful step up in cash flow in the fourth quarter, and our capital deployment priorities remain consistent with our long-term framework. Regarding share repurchase, year-to-date through October 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 16.9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $5.7 billion, including our repurchase of $715 million in the month of October alone. We continue to expect additional share repurchase in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our confidence in the strength and sustainable growth of our business. Now to recap, strong results through the first three quarters of the year give us confidence to deliver on our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, representing over 13% year-over-year growth toward the higher end of our long-term average adjusted EPS growth target range. As David mentioned, we look forward to providing our 2025 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. We are confident in delivering another year of competitively differentiated EPS growth of at least 10%, consistent with our historical approach where we start the year with appropriate prudence. The ability to consistently meet our financial commitments is a testament to our team executing to drive value for our clients and customers and our portfolio of complementary businesses that we've strategically positioned for strong, stable, and sustainable long-term growth. And with that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Good morning, AJ. So first off, we're very pleased with the strength of our U.S. employer business within Cigna Healthcare. That business continues to perform well for us. And as a reminder, our U.S. employer book is nearly 85% ASO or self-funded, which includes earning levers that go well beyond the peer risk-based MCR. That said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within our target margin ranges here in 2024. As it relates to the external market to your point on employers, we characterize the environment as competitive but rational, and we've remained disciplined with our own pricing strategy in this environment. As it relates to 2025, we do expect cost trends to remain elevated above historical levels, and we're pricing for 2025 rate increases that are greater than what we achieved in 2024, given that continued elevated cost trend expectation, the firm competitive environment, as well as our desire to preserve our margin levels. So David, I'll turn it over to you to talk about the Village piece. Good morning, Andrew, it's Brian. So as we intend to do in any year, we have a fair amount of our discretionary capital that goes back into internal reinvestments. So when we talk about the continued investment in the business, not just in the Evernorth platform, but also in Cigna Healthcare, that's a core part of our capital deployment framework before we start talking about capital being returned to shareholders. So this year, we're tracking to, call it, $1.5 billion or so of discretionary CapEx, and that's kind of over and above the core administrative expenses, which are round numbers about $20 billion that we spend in the year. So most of that will go toward technology going forward, so that some of that customer patient-facing technology. Some of that is provider-facing technology, and some of that is a broker or field-facing technology as well. So the majority of when you think about our discretionary CapEx is headed in that direction. And as we think about the long-term growth opportunity we have, for example, in the specialty space, which is already a $400 billion addressable market growing at the secular high-single-digit type rate. We see opportunities to continue strengthening our capabilities there to make ourselves even more relevant. So think of it as primarily technology, and we gear that up or down in any given year. Good morning, Scott, it's Brian. I'll take both of your questions here. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance within Cigna Healthcare with the overall performance in line with expectations, as I noted earlier. And just as a reminder, we had planned and price for the overall elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. And within the quarter specifically, we had a range of affordability initiatives that proved to be beneficial to the MCR, and it had some offset to the uptick I mentioned in specialty drug utilization in the quarter. And where we saw that most notably was, we saw some deceleration in cost trends in surgical activity in particular. You asked about inpatient. Inpatient was broadly in line with our expectations in the quarter. So I wouldn't flag that as a particular hotspot or an area of favorability. And as David said, we're fortunate to have the natural hedge at the enterprise level where the elevated customer demand for specialty drugs resulted in the favorable performance, we saw in our Evernorth business, specifically within the specialty and care services platform. As it relates to the individual exchanges, so we continue to see this market as being an important subsegment of the U.S. health care system for those who don't have access to employer or government-sponsored coverages. We've been a consistent player in this market over the past decade since the ACA went into effect. And for us, 2024 has been a year focused on margin expansion in our individual exchange business. And that approach is playing out largely as we expected here with fewer customers in 2024, but carrying a higher profit margin profile compared to our 2023 experience. As it relates to 2025, specifically, as you noted, the weighted average rate increase for our customer base is in the low double digits, which based on the publicly available information is on the higher end of the competitive set. That said, there's a considerable variation by geography when you dig into that. And for us, the exact margin profile and customer volumes will be a function of geographic mix and competitor behavior in each of those different geographies. But taken all together, we continue to invest in this business, see it as a growth engine for the company and over time, look forward to 10% to 15% annualized growth here. Good morning, Adam, it's Brian. I'll start. If you my colleagues want to pile on, you're welcome to. So as it relates to what we saw in Cigna Healthcare on the Specialty drug side, really, the uptick in the utilization was broad-based across most of our Accredo therapeutic resource centers in the third quarter. In particular, we saw it in inflammatory conditions, oncology and neurology. And really this transpired across all the Cigna Healthcare product lines, Commercial Employer, Medicare and the individual exchanges. The Medicare volumes were slightly more elevated than commercial, but not enough that we would flag it as having a different root cause, and we do not see the IRA is having driven a meaningful amount of the third quarter experience. And as I said earlier, I'm pleased to have the natural hedge with the Evernorth Specialty business benefiting from those increased volumes in the quarter. Sure, David. So as it relates to the prior year development that we saw in the third quarter, it was a little bit higher than we typically would see in the third quarter. But Important to keep in mind that, that's gross prior year development, which doesn't translate one for one to a net P&L impact, just given the variety of factors like client sharing, MLR rebate impacts and other items. And in any given period, we tend to see a fluctuation as you can appreciate, in reserve development from year-to-year, quarter-to-quarter. And overall, the net P&L effect of prior period reserve development was not a significant driver of the Cigna Healthcare MCO or the Cigna Healthcare income in the third quarter. So I appreciate the questions. Yes. Lance, on the second question in terms of how employers are reacting to a higher cost trend environment, a few things highlight there from our U.S. employer portfolio. Affordability is generally the number one topic when we talk to employer clients. And historically, they look at benefit buy-downs, changes to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums maybe premium contribution changes. But the strategies are becoming more precise and more granular now. So as an example, we're seeing more and more interest in our specialty pharmacy capabilities, programs like the EnCircleRx to help mitigate GLP-1 spending and ensure clinical appropriateness of all those programs. So we're seeing interest in more precise affordability programs. We're also seeing a lot of interest in our mental health and substance of these capabilities. Since the pandemic started, this has been a higher cost trend category. And even this year, it's contributing about 1% to employer cost trends just in the year. So there's interest in what programs and services we have available to address that as well as the link between mental and physical health, which has been shown, metal health utilization deflects physical health needs down the line. And then finally, there's interest in more precise provider network configurations that help to optimize cost, quality incentive alignment. So things like our Pathwell Specialty offerings, things like our Pathway Bone & Joint program, so all those things are of increased interest to employers in a high trend environment. And taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address those themes. Sure, David. Michael, I'll give you maybe a little bit more detail on the three tailwinds and three headwinds that David outlined earlier on the call. So in terms of the three tailwinds we see for 2025, continued biosimilar adoption is one. Obviously, that's been a theme throughout the morning here, and we do have a high degree of confidence in that being delivered in 2025. Secondly, we expect advancements in our large PBS client relationships. Obviously, we had a very sizable new client in '24. We also have others that we've onboard in recent years. And then the third tailwind is EPS accretion from the deployment of the Medicare sale proceeds. And given we know the magnitude of this, we would expect this to be a low single-digit percent impact on 2025 EPS when you think about the deployment of those proceeds. That's offset by three primary headwinds that we see at this juncture. The first is the absence of the 2025 VillageMD dividend recognition. So as I made reference to earlier, that was $33 million in the third quarter. You annualize that out. It's about $130 million of a headwind for 2025 to the Evernorth segment income as well as, obviously, the enterprise. Secondly, we'll have some stranded overhead from the Medicare divestiture, which is currently at about $150 million for the year. And you can think of that as split roughly half and half between Cigna Healthcare and Evernorth. And obviously, our teams will work to whittle that down over time, but we see that as about $150 million headwind for '25. And then finally, continued investments for long-term growth, as I made reference to an earlier question, that will gear up or gear down depending on the market opportunities that we see as we balance short-term and long-term needs for the company. So Eric, you can pile on here on the biosimilars part of the question?"

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks Ralph. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. Today I'll spend a few minutes talking about our strong results in the third quarter and how we're advancing our growth strategy. I'll also provide some initial perspective relative to 2025, including some of the expected tailwinds and headwinds. Then Brian will share more detail about our results and our outlook for the rest of the year and we'll take your questions. So let's get started. Building on a track record of competitively differentiated performance, I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter the Cigna group delivered total revenue of $63.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $7.51. Our results are a testament to the collective depth and strength of our people and commitment, hard work and focus they bring to everything we do. We have deep continuity and the most experienced leadership team in the industry with more than 16-years average tenure across our growth platforms. And we continue to infuse new talent into the company from across many sectors and industries to round out our enterprise perspective. Our third quarter performance demonstrates how we harness the complementary capabilities of our two growth platforms: Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare to drive attractive growth. This quarter Evernorth anchored our results by delivering strong top and bottom line contributions generated by market leading innovation and affordability initiatives, particularly within our specialty and care services portfolio, as well as our pharmacy benefit service business. Evernorth's strong overall growth reflects the continued demand for our services as we continue investing in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. Cigna Healthcare was also continuing their momentum in the quarter. U.S. employer business draws on enterprise capabilities to deliver greater affordability and support healthy outcomes for the benefit of our clients and their employees and families. Of note, we are driving continued solid growth in our select customer segment. Our results demonstrate focus execution and momentum during our peak selling season and continued opportunity for growth in the years ahead. Touching on our Medicare Advantage business, we remain on track to close on our sale of our Medicare business to HCSC in the first quarter of 2025. We continue to expect to use the majority of the proceeds for share repurchase. I would note that our Medicare business is performing in line with expectations and we're pleased with the overall value of our offerings, including our nationwide enrollment weighted average will again be four stars for 2025. Going forward, our focus will be on further growing our Evernorth chassis to continue to serve Medicare lives. Overall, our quarterly results reflect clear strategy and strong execution resulting in attractive results. Now stepping back, I want to take a moment to comment on recent headlines and speculation around our company. And while we don't comment on media rumors, we believe that it is important to provide additional context during these unprecedented times. First, there is no question that the industry is highly disrupted. For example, the Medicare Advantage market is particularly challenged given a number of factors, including elevated medical costs, a significant change in SARS ratings for many, and a reset of the risk-adjusted revenue streams. These and other forces are contributing to operational disruption for some as well. As I noted, we don't comment on rumors. But what I will do is be very clear on the actions we are pursuing. We continue to deploy our excess free cash flow for share repurchase, with repurchases totaling $5.7 billion year-to-date, including over $715 million in October. Looking forward, we expect to continue to actively repurchase our shares in the fourth quarter, further leveraging our remaining repurchase capacity, which stands at $5.6 billion. Now I want to transition and cover several actions we are driving in the third quarter and throughout 2024 that address the forces of change that are reshaping the face of healthcare, while we continue to position our company for growth for the benefit of our clients, our customers, and our patients. The first is the pace and rate of pharmacological innovation, and it continues to surge. Many of the treatments coming to market are meaningful in extending and improving quality of lives, for example, through new gene therapies and breakthrough treatments, but they are pressuring affordability given the high list price for manufacturers. Evernorth's specialty pharmacy business, Accredo, is continuing its strong growth trajectory given both the secular tailwinds and our differentiated strengths, which make us the market leader in the space. The opportunity in biosimilars is a good example of how we are leading the way in providing more value. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. And we're pleased that biosimilar penetration was approximately one-third among eligible accredited patients in the quarter. Building on that success, several weeks ago we announced that we will begin offering an interchangeable to Stelara Biosimilar in 2025. Like Humira Biosimilar, it will be available for a $0 out of pocket for eligible Accredo patients, which drives savings for individuals as well as clients. Another example of our leadership is the GLP-1 drug class, which is on pace to be the number one drug trend driver for plants this year. Now, they're expensive with manufacturers' list price of approximately $15,000 a year. Express Scripts, our pharmacy benefit service business, the EnCircle Rx solution provides a clinical program wrapper around the medication to help to support sustainable and positive lifestyle changes for patients, as well as improve affordability and access for clients. I'm pleased to share that in the quarter, EnCircle has already grown to almost 8 million lives now enrolled. The pace of change in the pharmacological industry is also why we continue to proactively address misconceptions and misinformation around the pharmacy benefits industry. This is vital to ensure that patients and individuals continue to maintain access to affordable, high-quality prescriptions. Earlier this month, Dr. Dennis Carlton, Professor of Economics Emeritus from the University of Chicago and former DOJ economists released a comprehensive review of the PVM industry. Dr. Carlton's research was conducted over 16-months and drew from multiple sources, including analysis of approximately 20 billion 30-day equivalent prescriptions. The finding of Dr. Carlton's research in direct contradiction with the FTC's report concludes that PBMs lower high drug prices by fostering competition among [tribal] (ph) drug manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs facilitate broader access to generic medications in addition to name brand alternatives, which lower costs. And importantly, PBM support independent pharmacies with higher reimbursement rates than chains. And the number of independent pharmacies is increasing. We will leverage Dr. Carlton's study as we continue to engage in fact-based discussions about these critical issues. Moving to the second rapidly changing trend, the increased need for quality behavioral services, which is in part driven by geopolitical, economic, social dynamic tensions that are unfolding around the globe. For context, in the past five years, we've seen overhaul behavioral therapy utilization nearly double. Now in the same period, we worked to increase services and access, for example, adding almost 270,000 providers to our network, assessing the needs of those with lower complexity issues and offering new coaching programs, and implementing online scheduling and access with appointments guaranteed within 72 hours, which millions of Cigna Healthcare customers can now pursue. This is another example of how our businesses have complementary capabilities as we leverage behavioral health innovations and services from Evernorth and embed them into Cigna Healthcare Solutions. The final trend that I will touch on is technology-enabled innovations. We're only beginning to see the start of profound changes as emerging technologies such as AI-powered diagnostics and treatments will drive vast improvements including more personalized care. Another example is the ongoing adoption of virtual services which is rapidly rising with about 25% of patients accessing care through telehealth services last year in the U.S. This far exceeds the 5% or fewer who accessed care this way prior to the pandemic. We continue to advance in this area with our telehealth platform MDLIVE. We have offered MDLIVE for our customers since its acquisition in 2021. And last month we took another step forward with patients that have lower health risk issues enabling them to get fast, flexible care without a phone call or video call, whenever and wherever they want, with MDLIVE physicians via an online portal. And patients typically are able to receive treatment within one hour. At the Cigna Group, we're built to create and capture value from these forces of change for the benefit of those we serve. Next, I'll transition to provide some context relative to the tailwinds and headwinds we anticipate for 2025. Now we'll provide detailed guidance as we always do during our fourth quarter call. With the strength of our Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare platforms, we expect to both finish 2024 strong and for 2025 to have another year of competitively attractive performance. Some notable tailwinds include our continued ramp-up of biosimilar offerings, continued advancement of new client relationships, and EPS accretion from the divestiture of our Medicare business, specifically the impact of share repurchase from the sales proceeds. Now turning to headwinds, we expect lower net investment income as we will no longer recognize the dividend from our VillageMD investment. We anticipate some stranded overhead from the sale of our Medicare Advantage business, which we will mitigate over time. And we will make continued strategic investments across our portfolio to drive sustained innovation and position ourselves for long-term growth. Considering all the puts and takes, we expect another strong year of growth in 2025 with EPS growth of at least 10%, which is consistent with our historical approach when we start the year with appropriate prudence. Now I'll briefly summarize our performance for the quarter. Building on our momentum, our focus in discipline third-quarter execution positions us to meet our full-year 2024 and long-term growth targets. The Cigna group has earned a reputation for delivering differentiated value for those we serve and driving new innovation in ways that lead the industry. Our ability to consistently do this year-after-year is directly attributable to the strength of our leadership team and the passion and commitment of our 70,000 colleagues worldwide. And the deliberate structure of our company, which is designed with growth platforms capable of navigating even the most dynamic environments. As a result, in the third quarter, we delivered on our financial commitments with adjusted EPS of $7.51, and we remain on track to deliver full-year adjusted earnings per share of at least $20.40 in 2024. Our company has attractive and sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term and we remain confident in delivering our continued average annual EPS growth rate of 10% to 14% on average, building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS on a compound growth rate over the past decade. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to share additional perspective on our performance for the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Good morning, AJ, it's David. Let me ask Brian to take your first question relative to trend \u201824 and \u201825, and then I'll provide a little call around Village and specifically our value-based care strategy and where we go from here. Brian? Sure. AJ, so relative to Village, you brought up part of your question, talks about the strategy. So stepping back first and foremost, VBC, Value-Based Care, from our point of view is how do we align incentives, leverage information, and then leverage clinical resources and extenders to deliver improved overall quality and ultimately value. Within our Cigna Healthcare platform, that's done day in, day out for collaborative accountable care relationships, and those relationships continue to evolve. Those are partnered relationships, leverage relationships that we drive forward. Increasingly, some of Evernorth's capabilities are in support of that. Second, specific to the VillageMD relationship, we sought to accelerate that through our Evernorth Accountable Care relationship for lives and patients outside of those that were within our program and chassis on the benefit side of the equation. And in hindsight, the timing of that, given the disruptions at the marketplace, including the risk-adjusted disruption and some of the cash flow disruption from some of the underlying investors proved to be poorly timed. Moving forward from an Evernorth standpoint, the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships will continue to probe and identify where and how we can expand relationships. I would note that we do continue to make very good progress of deepening relationships with healthcare professionals out of Evernorth, specifically off of our CuraScript capabilities that could use to grow meaningfully. But we will continue to take a paced path with the Evernorth Accountable Care relationships currently given the disruption, again, meaningfully caused by the change in the risk adjuster environment. Thanks, AJ. Justin, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question, and then I'll ask Eric to give you, I think your broader second question is relative to what's transpired in the Specialty space. So first, to the specific part of your question, you didn't miss anything I communicated. We've not provided detailed guidance for 2025. We'll provide more comprehensive guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter call and we look forward to doing so. Second, stepping back, as I noted in my prepared remarks, given the disruption in the space, we wanted to ensure that we had as much information out there and the clarity of put forth. I'd ask maybe to step back and reflect for a moment. If you think about to the core of your question, what we've done, our actions that both Brian and I reinforced meaningful share repurchase in 2024, which has been on a repurchasing through the month of October and expect it to continue to repurchase in the fourth quarter. If you reflect back on the last four years, we've repurchased about $24 billion of our stock, right? That was strategically guided as we were harnessing the benefit of the combination. We did have some divestitures within the context of that and as we leverage the broad cash flow generation of our asset-light portfolio and capabilities. So I would ask you to stay tuned for more comprehensive 2025 guidance, but reflect on our disciplined track record of being a good steward of capital and demonstrating the ability to create real sustained shareholder value in the way we deploy capital. Eric, I'll ask you to talk about the Specialty space. Sure. Thanks. I'll just amplify two points. As we all spend a significant amount of time in the market, we're a field-based organization. This is typically a top one, two or three topic with clients, with brokers, with consultants and with others in the market. So as we noted, GLP-1s remain front and center. The specific piece I would add, though, is as the market continues to absorb the challenges of affordability, the market also is observing and clients are observing and physicians are observing the start and stop dynamic that is transpiring for some patients, which also doesn't generate the desired or intended outcome if a patient starts on a regimen and stops in eight months and then maybe starts up and then maybe stops as well. So folks are really -- the value proposition really resonates relative to the clinical wrappers, the care wrappers, the coaching wrappers, the behavioral support wrappers that exist in the value-based care nature of the underlying program. So I appreciate you calling out the growth because it is significant and it underscores the need for innovation that we lead as these new treatments come to market. Lisa, it's David. Let me ask Eric to start with the Evernorth selling season, including the PBM dynamic and what's transpiring and then I'll address your FTC question. This is relative to the FTC, I think the end of your question really pointed toward legislation, but let me just pull back for a moment. First and foremost, and you know the space extremely well, right? PBM and pharmacy benefit service industry exists to create real, sustained differentiated value through improved affordability, through expanding access to services that are more affordable like generics, through patient coordination and clinical coordination programs, which are especially critical for the chronic and polychronic population. And as a validation of the value we deliver, our client retention levels reinforce that with historic client retention levels in the 95% plus range. And as we look to the year ahead in 2025, it being even at the higher end of that range. And secondly, as we've talked about, whether it's through EnCircleRx, through the biosimilars, our ability to continue to lead the market with innovations that deliver more value especially with new treatments coming to market is mission-critical. Specific to the FTC report, let me be really clear. We disagree on the unfounded assertions that were put forth. Second, the clear direction that was put forth by Dr. Carlton's report is in direct contrast to that. And going forward, we will engage in fact-based conversations. As it relates specifically to legislation, we do not see any specific fully mature proposed legislation right now that looks like it will be put forward. Obviously, there's a bit more time left in the year. There's no doubt relative to that. We remain actively engaged. I was in Washington on Monday of this week on a variety of topics. We remain actively engaged. But I think most importantly, at capping it off, we're confident in the durability of our model, our proven ability to partner, our proven ability to drive ongoing innovation to make sure we are able to continue to grow and deliver the value, both in the pharmacy benefit service space as well as in the specialty space. Erin, just one point I want to add to Eric's comment relative to the specialty market specifically, and maybe it's a statement of the obvious, but when we operate in an environment of elevated medical cost pressure which the industry is seeing in a broader sense, you could also think about the high-performing nature in this case, of our specialty capabilities, both through Accredo as well as through CuraScript, in some ways, provides us a natural or structured hedge against the medical cost pressure that is natural to manifest itself on the benefit side of the equation. So when we talk about the conscious way, we've structured the corporation, we've structured it, obviously, with different addressable markets. We've structured it with an asset-light framework. But in this case, also highlighting the structure provides some natural hedge when inflationary pressure or utilization pressure manifests on one side, it also provides growth opportunity and value capture opportunities on the other side of our very diverse portfolio. So I just wanted to punctuate that. And Brian, the only thing I would add is, Adam, to your broader question, as noted in our opening comments, but by and large, the Medicare Advantage portfolio of our business is performing in line with our expectations as we build the plan out for the course of the year. So Brian's reference is on the margin in terms of the elevation there. George, my comments relative to the marketplace are our view, a statement of fact, given the current environment, drawing back to your broader point of view, we see from a societal standpoint, MA as currently and in the future, an important part of the offering to the marketplace. So it would be very clear. Secondly, as we've discussed before, within our Evernorth portfolio today, fully approaching one-third of all of our product programs and services face off against government-sponsored programs, very inclusive of MA and the supporting programs are on MA and we will continue to invest in and grow those programs, products and services. What I was seeking to draw back to was, again, given the disruption in the marketplace and the headline that we were drawn into great clarity that the marketplace is disrupted and our actions and our behaviors are consistent with what we said they were going to be specifically using our discretionary free cash flow for share repurchase. Looking forward, I would expect to see the MA marketplace find its footing again, albeit it's going to go through a choppy phase right now for the forces I talked about before, elevated medical costs. Significant reset the stars. So if you look back, there was a time when the marketplace had almost 90% of all lives in four-star plus plans that gets reset down to 60% plus of lives. That's a large resetting for the marketplace. The risk adjuster part of the program coming through is also quite meaningful. So I deem it to be transitional for the marketplace. The leaders in the marketplace will find a way to lead through this. And importantly, MA serves a very important value prop from a societal standpoint. On average, an MA life as lower income on average in MA life is supportive of better clinical coordination, clinical efficacy and an average in MA life is getting better overall value and affordability. The space is just going through a choppy time right now, and that's what we're trying to call attention to. Josh, good morning, it's David. Let me take your first question and then ask Brian to take the second part of your questions. No. If the specific answer to your question, the call -- the cadence of our buybacks is driven by cash flow timing. So you'll note that our cash flow, and we've highlighted this in the past, doesn't happen ratably throughout the course of the year. So early part of the year, we expected to have significant deployment of capital and toward the latter part of the year, we expect to have significant deployment of capital. So specific to your question, the timing and cadence of deployment of free cash flow is tied to the timing of the cash flow generation in the fourth quarter will be a high cash flow generation quarter for us. And we highlighted the fact that we are quite active in the marketplace, noting the share repurchase through the month of October thus far. Brian, can I ask you to take the second part of the question? Lance, good morning, it's David. Let me take your strategic question specific to M&A criteria and then ask Brian to take your follow-up. You painted a mis-cleanup. I find that interesting. But specific to your strategic question, if you step back and think about our M&A criteria, which is the core of your question, our criteria has not changed. And to remind you, first is strategic alignment. Then second is financial attractiveness. I'll come back to that in a moment. And then third is our need to see a clear path to close. As it relates to financial attractiveness, we take into consideration EPS accretion. So the level of, the timing of, the visibility of, the durability of. We also look at capital efficiency, return on invested capital on a relative basis in terms of assessing it. So to the core of your question, if I heard you correctly, a more disruptive environment or a less stable asset would increase the beta. Increasing the beta requires a higher visibility to highly durable synergies, value capture and the durability of that. So to the core of your question is, of course, we have to consider that because you're looking for strategic value creation and strategic value capture. And adjacency versus further adjacency and the more stable and predictable versus the more volatile has to be taken into consideration. And I'll end with, I believe we have a very clear, good track record of applying these criteria and creating shareholder value over a long period of time. Brian, I'll transition you? Michael, good morning, it's David. You packed a lot in there for us to begin to bring our call to a close in short order, but important topics. So first, let me just frame a little bit of the headwind tailwind framework and then ask Brian to peel it back, although it will give you a bit more specificity. And then we'll transition to Eric, who will talk about the trends in direction, et cetera. I don't think we're declaring a new normal as opposed to the growth trajectory we see relative to that business in the 8% to 12% compounded over time, which is above the secular trends. But let me shift back to the headwind tailwind. As I noted in my prepared remarks, we'll provide much more detail in our fourth quarter call as we provide the 2025 outlook and guidance as we always do. Importantly, and we want to stress, this will come off of 2024, which is going to be another strong year and competitively differentiated year. And our outlook for 2025 will be a strong year and competitively differentiated year. And we highlighted several of the headwinds and tailwinds as you put them all together, even at this point, we're confident to step forward and say that our growth algorithm will be intact for 2025, yet we would expect to guide at the lower end of our algorithm range with taking a posture prudence. So Brian, could I ask you to give a little bit more color on some of the drivers within the headwinds and tailwinds and some dimensioning? Thank you. I just want to briefly wrap up. Most importantly, thanks for your questions, your time and your engagement on our call today. Just to highlight a few headlines. Cigna Group once again, given our business momentum and complementary growth platforms delivered a strong third quarter, and we remain on track to deliver our 2024 EPS outlook of at least $20.40, and we're on track for another competitively differentiated year in 2025. Before I close, I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues around the world and a fantastic senior leadership team. It's their focus, caring orientation and commitment that allows us to do what we do day in, day out for those we have the privilege to serve. We're proud of what we've accomplished in the third quarter and the trajectory that we have for the full-year, and we look forward to talking you in the future. Have a great day."

            "name": "Eric Palmer",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, David. And good morning, Justin, it's Eric. As we find at our Investor Day earlier this year, the Specialty market is a $400 billion market and growing. And we're leaders in this space, driven by our focused condition-specific model, our clinical expertise and our overall geographic reach. And this positions us well to be helpful to our clients across the board, whether it's health plans, employers, health systems and the like. Now specific to this quarter, this was the first full quarter where we dispensed our biosimilar Humira. And additionally, we had some expansion with existing clients choosing to move more business to Accredo. And we had broad-based volume strength as well. And I'd call out therapies for inflammatory conditions, for oncology and neurology as areas with particularly strong growth in the quarter. With respect to the 23% growth in the quarter, we've noted in the past that the results in any given quarter is going to depend on the timing of new volumes, new customers, new therapies being available and so on. But over time, we expect this market to be a meaningful part of the growth of our enterprise. We've talked about our Specialty and Care Solutions space growing at 8% to 12% on a sustained annual basis. And all of these factors are built into our assessment there. So we continue to be well positioned in this market and quite excited about the opportunities to serve the market to grow and to serve our patients. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Good morning, Ryan, it's Eric. Thanks the question. As you can imagine, there's real interest in need from our clients is they're looking for help with managing the affordability of GLP-1s and these conditions overall. We're really excited about the opportunity to bring this first of its kind solution to the market. And as David noted, I think you said we're almost at 8 million lives. So not quite there yet, but approaching it rapidly. We launched this program just a handful of months ago. And as we've talked about previously, it targets the right patient population, working to bring the relevant clinical markers and engage patients with the support they need to help make changes that make the impact last, provides a guaranteed clinical comes to our clients and provides a strong overall return for the investment in the program. Performance so far is that the solution is working well. The early results, our clients are enrolled. They're seeing significant savings and reductions in trends compared to those who are not enrolled as we mature the process or mature the data, we'll have more to report here. David, maybe any other perspective you want to share? Thanks, David. Lisa, fundamentally, we start with a portfolio that's equipped to offer choice and flexibility in how we work to support our clients. We work to make the pharmacy benefit accessible for the patient and more affordable, and we continue to innovate to bring new ways to the market to do that. And stepping back, Evernorth is well positioned to continue to grow. The strength of those innovations and our solutions continue to resonate. And just as we talked about the growth EnCircleRx, we continue to have growth in our various innovative programs. Now specifically with respect to the pharmacy benefit services business for 2025, we had a good 2025 selling season, and our retention rate continues to be consistent with recent years in the mid- to high-90s percent range. We're driving meaningful innovations, whether it's EnCircleRx, our oncology benefit services are just recent examples. And we're positioned for another good year in 2025. As far as change, again, I'd say there's good interest in discussing what services, what financing arrangements are going to best align with our clients' needs, but I wouldn't call out any wholesale or substantial change in terms of what our customers and clients are actually purchasing from us. David? Hi, Erin, it's Eric. I appreciate the question. Stepping back, I think the model that we've built here and that we've deployed around our biosimilar Humira has provided another good choice in the market, and it's one that we think we're well positioned to replicate in the appropriate situations going forward. As David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we will be launching a no out-of-pocket cost alternative to Stelara in 2025. And I could envision us using this playbook and approach for additional biosimilars as we look ahead into the coming years. We've noted at our Investor Day earlier this year that we see nearly half of the specialty market having biosimilar alternatives choice available in terms of bringing new affordability to the market. And this is one example of a strategy that will help to improve the affordability and the accessibility of these medicines for the patients that need them and for the plan sponsors that are funding them. So every different therapy will have a different alternatives, they will have different kind of adoption of paths based off of the clinical needs of the patients being served based off of the break and pace of availability of products and such. But at a macro level, we're really well positioned to continue to lead in this market and bring new solutions to market just like we did with the biosimilar Humira, like we are in the process of doing with Stelara and like we'll do with other drugs coming after that. David? Thanks, Brian, and thanks for the question, Michael. With respect to HUMIRA, a couple of notes I wanted just to be clear on, we began to spend in a biosimilar HUMIRA at the end of June. We noted in our second quarter call that throughout the month of July, had achieved about 20% -- or about 20% of our customers had elected to use the biosimilar HUMIRA. And that's grown throughout the quarter. The number we provided today was that across the third quarter in its entirety now about 33% of the eligible patients had adopted. So really nice growth throughout the quarter. We would expect that to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And to your more macro question, just I'll step back for a minute. We're well positioned to bring value to the benefit of our customers and clients overall. And as we've noted for several years now, we see and have worked to deliberately position ourselves to be lined up to capture the forces associated with pharmacological innovation and we've positioned our company to play a leading role in connecting patients with the medicines that they need there. At our Investor Day back in March, we again increased the top end of our long-term growth range for Evernorth up to 5% to 8% growth, and that reflects all of these dynamics. And so that's the I think the fourth time we increased the growth trajectory of Evernorth since Evernorth was launched just a few years ago, and we're excited about the opportunity to continue to grow in this space are the same, the positive forces that we've just talked about and the ability to have a meaningful positive influence on affordability of health care and the patients that we serve overall. So we're excited about the opportunity and well positioned to play a leading role here."

We will conduct a question-and-answer session later during the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference, including the Q&A session, is being recorded. We'll begin by turning the call over to Ralph Giacobbe. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today's call. I'm Ralph Giacobbe, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the line this morning are David Cordani, the Cigna Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Evanko, Chief Financial Officer of the Cigna Group and President and Chief Executive Officer of Cigna Healthcare; and Eric Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Evernorth Health Services. In our remarks today, David and Brian will cover a number of topics, including our second quarter financial results and our financial outlook for 2024. Following their prepared remarks, David, Brian and Eric will be available for Q&A. As noted in our earnings release, when describing our financial results, we use certain financial measures, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted revenues, which are not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally, accepted in the United States, otherwise known as GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, shareholders net income and total revenues, respectively, is contained in today's earnings release, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of the cignagroup.com. We use the term labeled adjusted income from operations and adjusted earnings per share on the same basis as our principal measures of financial performance. In our remarks today, we will be making some forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our outlook for 2024 and future performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. A description of these risks and uncertainties is contained in the cautionary note to today's earnings release and in our most recent reports filed with the SEC. Regarding our results in the second quarter, we recorded an after-tax net special item charge of $64 million or $0.23 per share. Details of the special items are included in our quarterly financial supplement. Additionally, please note that we will make prospective comments regarding financial performance, including our full year 2024 outlook, we will do so on a basis that includes the potential impact of future share repurchases and anticipated 2024 dividends. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David.\nDavid Cordani: Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the second quarter, we again delivered strong performance as we continue to build on our momentum. Today, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter and key strategic drivers of our growth, demonstrate how the strength and durable nature of our model is fueling our success. Then Brian will review additional details on our results and our outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll move to your questions. So let's get started. For the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that the Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $60.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72. We achieved these positive overall results in a dynamic environment, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to focus on those we serve, ensuring that they get care of the need, to get their medications at an affordable cost and they get the support they need in order to make the best decisions about their health and vitality. All of this requires a relentless focus on innovation, disciplined execution and a passionate commitment to our mission. During the quarter, our Evernorth Health Service businesses demonstrated continued strength with our market-leading specialty and pharmacy benefit services capabilities. Within Evernorth, I'll start with our accelerated growth specialty and care businesses, which provides specialty drugs for the treatment of complex and rare diseases, distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals as well as clinical programs to help clients improve health and vitality. We saw strong growth in the quarter with adjusted income growing 12% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand for our services while we also continue to invest in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. In Accredo, our specialty business, our growth continues to be fueled by secular tailwinds as well as Accredo's differentiated strength which makes us the market leader in the space. Biosimilars, for example, represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for continued growth and impact. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. Our program has zero dollar out-of-pocket cost for patients, saving them on average $3,500 per year. To deliver these savings, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers that will produce biosimilars for Evernorth pharmaceutical distributor, Quallent Pharmaceuticals. Now the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond Humira. By 2030, we expect an additional $100 million of annual specialty drug spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition. And Accredo is well positioned to deliver differentiated value for our clients, customers and patients. In our care services businesses, we are continuing to grow and expand in key areas of increased demand, including behavioral health, virtual and home care. For example, in summer, we further expanded Evernorth behavioral care group to an additional seven states. We are seeing positive patient outcomes from our unique clinician matching capabilities based on individual needs and preferences with fully 84% of patients experiencing clinically significant reductions in the depression and anxiety symptoms. Now shifting to Express Scripts, our foundational pharmacy benefit services businesses, we are seeing continued strong client demand given our breadth of clinical and supply chain expertise as well as our proven partnership orientation. This quarter, Express Scripts built on a long track record of innovating for those we serve with continued enhancements and new solutions. For example, given the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, we're continuing to see meaningful interest from our clients in EnCircleRx, now with more than 2 million lives already enrolled. Our program starts with our longitudinal data to target patients who will most benefit from these medications and we provide patients with resources to make lasting changes to help maximize the effectiveness of these medications, both in the short and long-term. Another example of our innovation orientation is a recent announcement of Express Scripts oncology benefit services, which will be available in 2025. Our new solution helps patients navigate the challenges of cancer care by providing a single oncology benefit, integrating pharmacy, medical and behavioral health treatments. Our patient centered approach will help to ensure the earliest possible detection guide individuals to high-quality providers and coordinate care across clinical teams. Now moving to Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we continue to deliver solutions that create value and better outcomes for clients and customers, coupled with highly competitive total cost of care. Similar to others in the industry and as we've anticipated, we are seeing increased utilization in our book of business. I would note that our results are largely in line with the elevated levels in our planning and pricing assumptions. Our U.S. employer foundational growth business continues to perform in line with our expectations. Over this year, I've met with hundreds of clients across the U.S. and globally. And while the needs of every client are unique, there are a few consistent themes across every discussion. First, continued focus on affordability, particularly in light medications like GLP-1 and gene therapies coming to market. Next, an increased need of improved access and importantly, coordination of behavioral health services. Third is mounting point solution fatigue. And fourth, the opportunity and need for leverage of our longitudinal data and clinical programs to help keep people healthy and vital. Our solutions continue to resonate well given our highly consultative approach to help clients choose the right set of solutions, our proven capabilities to support their workforce and our innovative programs that help to keep costs down. As a result, we are further gaining share and continue to see outsized opportunities, for example, in our Select segment. Another capability of our U.S. employer business to deliver integrated and tailored benefits for our clients and customers, our modular solutions that incorporate innovative services from Evernorth, including Behavioral health, virtual care and pharmacy. Our Pathwell suite of solution, which continues to drive exceptional value is a prime example. Pathwell specialty is another way we are reducing costs associated with specialty drug therapies, while also providing improved care and clinical outcomes for patients. With our Accredo nurses, nearly 50% of our Pathwell specialty patients, who've transitioned their site of care, now receive treatment in the comfort and convenience of their home. We are pleased with how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through solutions like Pathwell. Turning to our Medicare Advantage business. We continue to make great progress regarding the sale of this business, and I'm pleased that we remain on track to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. Next, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the current environment surrounding pharmacy benefit managers and the relative landscape. At the heart of this debate is the cost of pharmaceuticals. As we previously discussed, a key force of change in health care is the surge of pharmacological innovation. For context, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used care benefit. And on average, it used 15x per year per person resulting in billions of dollars -- billions of prescriptions per year annually in the United States. Today, and for the foreseeable future, and most meaningful advances extending and improving quality of life will come through gene therapies, breakthrough and treatments for cancers and other conditions as well as personalized medicines. In the U.S., for example, there are already more than 20 gene therapy and cell therapies available. However, there are nearly 1,000 more in the pipeline. Additionally, as we know, GLP-1s are growing rapidly, helping to treat diseases and complications that stem from obesity and diabetes. This class of drug is on tap to be the #1 pharmacy benefit trend driver for plans of all sizes this year. And the impact will grow with some forecasting nearly 10% of the U.S. population using GLP-1s in the next 10 years or sooner. The applications rippling from these fast-growing pharmaceutical trends across the entire health care system are undeniable. And one of the biggest unanswered questions is how could society afford this continued trajectory? Our role is to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as pharmacies to ensure that individuals are able to access pharmacological innovations at a fair and affordable price. In fact, pharmacy benefit companies are the only part of the drug supply chain who work to drive cost down. To underscore this, new drugs coming to market with unsustainable prices in 2023, were up $300,000 on a median basis, up over 35% over 2022. And last year, median brand drug price increases were greater than 5% more than the rate of inflation. Let me repeat this. Last year, the median annual price for new drugs coming to market was $300,000, up 35% over 2022. Meanwhile, in 2023, Express Scripts change in pace and cost sharing was relatively flat on average. Express Scripts patients with employer sponsored drug coverage pay, on average, $15 out of pocket for a 30 day supply. And for clients, Express Scripts delivered more than $38 billion in savings annually. Stepping back, our industry negotiations to drive these results can at times generate friction in the system. Friction that is spilled into and now has reached tightened levels in the political arena and media with industry winners and losers being declared at every report and every headline. We believe that the facts and results and outcomes delivered to our clients, customers and patients will rule the day. However, the environment calls on us to be more proactive. This means ensuring that what we do and the value we bring is more widely and better understood. And we continue to evolve our model to address legitimate pain points and opportunities. For example, in 2023, 1% of the patients in the United States experienced out-of-pocket costs above $2,000 a year. From our point of view, that's too many. We accept the responsibility to accelerate innovation to make medications more affordable, while continuing to improve health outcomes in finding solutions for every person we serve. Make no doubt our team will continue to lean into the challenge for the benefit of our patients, clients and the health care ecosystem and we are proud of the work that our team does every day and the role we play and the results we're able to achieve. Now let me pause and summarize before transitioning to Brian. When you combine our compelling growth potential and strong execution focus, we have confidence in our ability to meet our 2024 and long-term growth targets. We have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value for those we serve by innovating new solutions like in EnCircleRx and our Pathwell suite as well as expanding meaningful partnerships. As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered on our financial commitment with adjusted EPS of $6.72, and we remain on track to deliver our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40 for 2024. Further, our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term, and we remain on track to deliver average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% and building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS growth over the last decade, all while we generate cumulative operating cash flow of $60 billion over the next five years, while continuing to meaningfully invest capital for the benefit of shareholders. We also continue to make strategic investments in strengthening our capabilities in our foundational and accelerated growth business and remain focusing on harnessing the breadth of our capabilities of our organization to meet the evolving needs of those we serve. Overall, our strong performance through the first half of the year reflects the balance in our company portfolio and the significant value creation that positions us for sustained and differentiated growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.\nBrian Evanko : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, reflecting growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. The results underpin the strength and the stability of our diversified portfolio of businesses in a dynamic environment and demonstrate continued execution against our operating and financial commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $60.5 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72 or 10% year-over-year growth. With the strong first half performance, we continue to have confidence in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, which represents more than 13% year-over-year growth in EPS. Now turning to our segment results. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by both of its operating segments. Second quarter 2024 revenues grew to $49.5 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 7% to $1.6 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. Specialty and Care Services showed strong growth with revenue up 18% to $22.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were up 12% to $756 million, at the high end of our long-term target growth range. This performance is a demonstration of our robust and diversified capabilities, as we delivered broad-based growth across our specialty businesses, Accredo and CuraScript as well as in our care services businesses. Pharmacy Benefit Services also posted strong revenue growth, driven by the addition of new business wins and expansion of existing relationships. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $798 million as our innovative capabilities continue to drive value for our clients, customers and patients. Overall, we're pleased with Evernorth's second quarter results and continue to expect strong income growth in the second half of the year. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2024 revenues were $13.2 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion. Second quarter earnings were in line with expectations and included approximately $50 million of unfavorable prior year impact related to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment. The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.3% was within our expected range, inclusive of the aforementioned unfavorable prior year impact of approximately $50 million or 40 basis points on the medical care ratio. Absent this item, the underlying medical care ratio was broadly in line with expectations. As noted previously, we had planned and priced for 2024 medical cost trend to be above 2023 levels, which took into account both unit cost inflation as well as continued elevated utilization. Year-to-date, we have seen elevated cost trends, consistent with our planning and pricing assumptions. The net medical cost payable at the end of the second quarter was $5.04 billion, compared to $5.66 billion at the end of the first quarter. As noted previously, in the first quarter, we had booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves relating to the Change Healthcare disruption. Those reserves have since developed in line with expectations and claims payments have returned to more normalized levels. driving the sequential decline in net medical cost payable. Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical Customers. We ended the quarter with 19 million total medical customers. We expect growth in Cigna Healthcare medical customers for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. employer Select and Middle market segments. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered consistent results in a dynamic operating environment. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024. With our continued strong underlying performance in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share. Regarding cadence of earnings, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects continued momentum into the second half, with third quarter Evernorth earnings expected to accelerate to high single-digit year-over-year growth, in part due to an increase in adoption of our interchangeable biosimilar offering. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 81.7% to 82.5%. With the first half medical care ratio coming in at 81.1%, the midpoint of our guidance implies an 83.1% medical care ratio for the second half of the year. We would expect the third quarter to be slightly below that level. Turning to our 2024 capital management position. As of July 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares of common stock or approximately $5 billion, consistent with our previous commentary. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Our first half 2024 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our two growth platforms, which gives us confidence to deliver on our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\nJustin Lake : Appreciate the commentary on cost trend. Maybe you can give us an update on what you're seeing by business line and also how things have trended 2Q versus 1Q? When you say it's in line with your pricing and your expectations, is that a year-to-date discussion? Or is that where trend is running today coming out of the second quarter? Is that in line? Or is that more or less elevated versus what you expected?\nBrian Evanko : Justin, it's Brian. So I'll start by saying we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance at Cigna Healthcare which ran toward the lower end of our MCR guidance range when you exclude the prior year Medicare risk adjustment revenue impacts in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Now within the quarter, total cost of care was broadly in line with expectations. There are a few puts and takes that I call out if we get into specific cost drivers. So we continue to see elevated usage of facility-based services, including emergency room. Additionally, we saw a continuation of elevated utilization of mental health care services, which we do see as a positive over the longer term given the correlation to whole person health. You'll recall in the first quarter, I highlighted slowing growth in surgical costs. During the second quarter, we continued to see abatement in the rate of growth of surgical costs although costs still didn't grow. Now taken all together, we are seeing sustained high cost trends, yet these are broadly in line with our guidance as we planned and priced for the elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. Now specifically in the second quarter, we did not witness aggregate acceleration or deceleration of care patterns within the quarter. I also would not note any month-to-month variability relative to the year-to-date experience that we've seen. So overall, we remain confident in the full year MCR range outlined in our guidance.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\nLisa Gill : I want to start with the 2025 selling season on the pharmacy side. You made comments around GLP-1. We continue to see new indications there. I'm just curious, one, when we think about the opportunities in '25, how would you characterize that to what kind of programs are people buying going into 2025? And then lastly, David, you made a comment that the facts need to be more widely understood when it comes to the pharmacy business. What are your plans around making those facts more wiping known? Because as you know, I agree with you that both Congress as well as the media reports don't fairly reflect what the benefits are of the business.\nEric Palmer : Lisa, it's Eric. I'll start then maybe invite David to add some additional comments on the end here. But overall, our foundational pharmacy benefit services business, Express Scripts is off to a really good start for 2025. We've got strong new sales and our 2025 retention rate is going to be consistent with three years and the mid-90s or better. Stepping back a little bit, Evernorth overall is -- continues to be well positioned to grow. The specialty business is also positioned for strong growth with significant growth driven by our pharmacy benefits clients electing to use our specialty capabilities as well as strong growth in services sold directly to health systems and other health plans. So overall, we are quite excited about the strength of the solutions and how they continue to resonate with the market overall. The themes or specific programs that I would point to come back to areas that help to make the value of the dollar spent on medicine is more effective, right? So programs like our EnCircleRx program that helps to effectively manage weight loss medication GLP-1 or our most recent oncology benefit offering that David mentioned a bit ago in his prepared remarks. So targeted specific types of programs that work really well with the broader suite of benefit offerings continue to resonate really well in that scenario we continue to invest in. David, do you want to take a bit on the broader environment comment?\nDavid Cordani : I appreciate the call out. First and foremost, let me reiterate we're proud of the work we do daily, and I'm greatly appreciative of our team that gets up everyday serving our patients and customers through employer relationships, health plane relationships, governmental entity relationships and increasingly through partnerships and collaborations to health care professionals. Second, we will and need to continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve, whether that's through the likes of ClearCareRx, our patient insurance program, our EnCircle program, our independent pharmacy program, all of which are first in the space. Now specific to your question, we challenged ourselves to be much more aggressive and complete relative to communication and engagement in support of our clients, be they employers or health buying customers collaborate even more deeply and intensely with the independent pharmacies and subsegmenting the independent pharmacists who are truly independent and rural working on the hill, of course. And then lastly, more aggressively leveraging credible third-party independent analysis of what our industry does and specifically what we do on behalf of those we serve in a fact-based incredible way. So you should expect to see us a bit more complete and aggressive ensuring that we're amplifying that. But make no doubt, we also need to continue to innovate as we have, and we will continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve.\nOperator: And this question comes from A.J. Rice , your line is open. You may ask your question from UBS.\nA.J. Rice: I might just flip over and ask you about the any distinctive you're seeing in the health benefit selling season across your book, and a large group and select, et cetera. And then also, you called out for quite a while now, fatigue on point solutions. I wonder, I understand how you're addressing affordability and understand how you addressing behavioral health integration. But on the point solution question, is there anything that is -- or do you think you'll consider buying some of these point solutions and then offering them as part of your integrated offering? Do you sort of see yourself getting in the middle of helping employers choose between the myriad of point solutions? How are you addressing that?\nBrian Evanko : A.J., it's Brian. I'll start on the Cigna Healthcare selling season and buying pattern dynamic. And then I think David will pick up on the second part of your question relative to point solutions and some of our inorganic activities. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare selling season, I'll concentrate my comments on the larger end of the U.S. employer market just given the time of the year. We're seeing a relatively consistent number of RFPs this year in comparison to last year at this time. And similarly, in terms of our existing clients, we have a similar amount out to bid as we did last year at this time. So, just for some context on the numbers. Now each of these larger employer clients tend to have unique needs. There's a few areas that thematically I'd call out in terms of what our teams are seeing out in the market. One, as David made reference to earlier, affordability continues to be a key area of focus particularly with the wave of drug innovation, including GLP-1s and gene therapy hitting the market. Secondly, to your point, some of the larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. Third, we're seeing mental health and substance of these benefits and programs becoming more and more important each year, particularly given some of the downstream effects of the pandemic. And finally, many of these larger clients are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to drive either further study care optimization or consumer empowerment. So taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address these themes and demands from large employers. And importantly, we also continue to see strong traction in net growth in our under 500 Select segment as you'll see in the statistical supplement, 7% year-over-year growth in customers within our Cigna Healthcare Select segment specifically. David, maybe you want to pick up on the point solution question?\nDavid Cordani : Sure. So first, if you think about some of the solutions we identified both in today's call and in prior conversations, you can think about our digital health formulary, as a way that we connect capabilities and work to connect them seamlessly. You can think about the way the Encircle program is designed. It's designed to have actually coordination and continuity that is patient-centric the oncology program that we will roll out in 2025 is another example of taking specific care need or episode of care and redesigning the pathway to care in a much more coordinated basis, staying focused on the patient and the health care professional. The Cigna Behavioral Group offering that I referenced has much more continuity and coordination of the care experience, starting from the access to the medical professional, the matching and the coordination and there'll be new offerings. You can think about all those as largely having been built organically as we continue to invest back in the organization. To the core question through acquisition, you could think about that as well, you never roll it out largely not fueled through acquisition, although there could be episodic coordination of point solutions. And then I would graph in the middle, I'd remind you that we operate the Cigna Ventures organization where we have a now meaningful track record of partnering with organizations where they are, by definition, almost point solutions and helping collaboratively to co-innovate with them as we go forward. So stepping back, largely organically driven proven track record and the acceleration of new innovations that are coming to market for the benefit of those we serve to meet that demand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Mok with Barclays.\nAndrew Mok: With all the changes coming to Part D, there could be significant changes, not only to membership, but also formulary managing for next year. How does the shifting risk to Part D sponsors impact Evernorth more broadly? And how are you helping clients navigate these changes?\nDavid Cordani : Andrew, it's David. Let me comment briefly on the PDP macro environment and then ask Eric to walk through our capabilities and our proven track record of supporting our clients relative to their PDP offerings. As you step back, it was clear that the Inflation Reduction Act as it was designed and the ultimate implementation of it was going to cause PDP premiums to rise meaningfully. And most likely, that was going to create some meaningful disruption for seniors. Now as the bids have gone in, CMS has assessed those bids and has drawn apparently some of the similar conclusions relative to the acceleration of the bids and the acceleration of the premiums required given the design features. And after reviewing those has created a short-term window for some bid adjustments that we and like others are going through that on an accelerated basis. So that disruption was designed from the Inflation Reduction Act in the marketplace is reacting to that. Mok Eric to talk more specifically to our capabilities and how we work and supportive in many cases, our health plan clients in their PDP book of business to ensure we deliver great quality and overall affordability. Eric?\nEric Palmer : Evernorth and Express Scripts specifically has a long history of supporting health plans to offer Medicare Part D plans. We've got a great track record of a treatment and strong stars outcomes for them and supporting our plans and their offerings and helping them with the tools to manage formularies and model the impacts of changes for example. We're continuing to make investments to help ensure our plans are well positioned with the continued evolution of Part D coverage. We even with the most recent round of changes from the IRA like the administrative requirements associated with the copay smoothing just as one example. This continues to be an important part of the Evernorth and Express Scripts business that we're positioned to continue to help our plans succeed and thrive as they work through these changes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens.\nScott Fidel : I was hoping to maybe just touch on the marketplace and a couple of things there. One, just with the [Hips] 2023 risk adjustment true-up, if you can tell us what the net impact was to earnings if there was any relative to how you had accrued for that? And then also, just when thinking about the commentary on cost trends. Maybe if you could overlay that into the marketplace in terms of if you're seeing a similar trend there and how that's influencing your view on exchange margins for the full year. I think that prior view had been probably still a bit below long-term target there for marketplace margins this year, just interested in an updated view on margins for the year.\nBrian Evanko : Scott, it's Brian. Maybe I'll try to just take a big picture view of the individual exchange business in aggregate and hit your risk adjustment question as part of that. So the headline I'd ask you to take away broadly speaking, our individual exchange book is performing as we expected in 2024. As it relates to the final 2023 individual exchange risk-adjusted true-up, we had already been accrued for a sizable risk adjustment payable. And in the second quarter results, we did have a small unfavorable true-up that was recorded in the Cigna Healthcare P&L. But overall, this was not a meaningful performance driver in the second quarter for us. And then as it relates to the 2024 performance year, we did receive our first look at the industry-wide risk adjustment data for the specific states we participate, as we closed up the second quarter books and the preliminary industry data confirmed that our previous 2024 risk adjustment assumptions were reasonable. My earlier commentary on cost trends was broadly applicable to the individual exchange business as well. So when you put all the pieces together, we are tracking toward the improved 2024 margin profile we outlined during our first quarter call. And therefore, we'd expect to land the year slightly below our long-term target margin range of 4% to 6% for the individual exchange business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Langston with TD Cowen.\nRyan Langston : Just looks like the exchange business was down maybe 99,000 to 100,000 members sequentially. I certainly understand why it was down versus '23 year-end, but wasn't exactly expecting that sequential move anything to call out there? And maybe a little early, but I'll ask just any expectations on 2025 in terms of growth trajectory and perhaps even margin profile?\nBrian Evanko : Ryan, it's Brian. Congratulations on your new role. As it relates to the individual exchange lives intra year, maybe I'll just step back and give you kind of a year-to-date perspective, and then I'll get into the sequential component of your question. So as we discussed during our first quarter results call, the primary driver of the year-to-date change in Cigna Healthcare customer volumes is our individual exchange book. You'll recall that we repositioned this business in 2024, including taking some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in order to improve profitability and we expected to see a reduction in customer volumes as we have witnessed. And sequentially, the individual exchange business drove the majority of the modest decline in the second quarter customer volumes. Now you should think of the primary driver of that being non-payment of premiums as a result of some of the pricing actions we took in a couple of the larger geographies. So it's essentially the delayed effect of those grace periods kicking in. It was an immaterial impact to our financial results in the quarter. Over the course of the balance of this year, we would expect to see continued strong growth within our U.S. employer under 500 Select segment, which should result in sequential growth in U.S. employer and Cigna Healthcare lives for the balance of the year. So taken all together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. As it relates to 2025 in the picture there, we've just recently completed all the pricing and rate filings network design. And until we really see all the competitive dynamics, it's hard to know how that will shake through we would expect our margins to be similar or potentially a little bit better next year in the individual exchange book as we look forward. But too early to know exactly how we'll shake out from a membership standpoint.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.\nJosh Raskin : I'd be curious to get your views on the potential for ICRA and specifically how that could impact the small group or select market? And maybe how does stop-loss fit into that equation?\nBrian Evanko : Josh, it's Brian. I'll take that one as well. So we see the ICRA market in its current form is likely being a niche market, but one that we're monitoring closely. So more specifically, we see the ICRA market as something that could be in a feeling option for smaller employers who tend to be more commoditized buyers. And we expect this is most likely to be an attractive option for employers with less than 50 employees, which is a market segment that is financially immaterial for us today. And within the under 50 market, the average employer there has fewer than 10 employees, so very small employers typically. Now all that said, our individual exchange business represents an opportunity for us to participate in the ICRA space, should it gain more momentum? Again, I didn't know where I started and that we see this most likely being a niche market our stop-loss offerings, to your question, are fully integrated with our Select segment business. So you should not think of that as something that is a net threat to us in the select market provided that the under 50 concentration transpires the way that I described earlier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.\nGeorge Hill : I thought I'd just ask a question on what I consider to be your cost of goods sold line, which is there continues to be a lot of discussion from the retail pharmacy side of the business around trying to negotiate new payment models or changes in terms. I don't know if there's any update that you can provide on how those conversations are progressing?\nEric Palmer : George, it's Eric. First, I'm going to comment on any specific negotiations with any pharmacies or things along those lines. But as you know, we've got a wide array of choices and options for our clients. That extends to how we've constructed our network as we look to balance access and affordability that best meets the needs of our clients and their patients. So we work to assemble a range of different network options under a range of different reimbursement types that match up with the needs for cost access and the associated trade-offs and touch there for our clients. So overall, that approach has served us well. We work to continue to innovate to bring new solutions to market. An example of a new solution there would be like late last year, we announced our ClearNetwork Solution. ClearNetwork provides a comprehensive simple solution in that, the pricing is based off of independent, externally created index and then it's got a simple margin that's shared between us and the pharmacy. So it's a new offering we put in the market last year that's generating interest. But again, overall, the portfolio of offerings that we continue to pull together resonates with our buyers and is part of the reason we've continued to grow the pharmacy benefits services, chassis nicely over the last few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Adam on for Kevin. So you raised guidance in Q1 on what seems like a smaller beat at least for street expectations, but you didn't raise guidance this quarter. Can you give a little more color on why maybe you wouldn't raise and how things came in versus your expectations? And if there's anything to read into on the PYD or on the -- maybe on DCPs being down. Any color would be helpful.\nBrian Evanko : Adam, it's Brian. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of results on both the top and bottom lines with overall results slightly ahead of our expectations in the second quarter. Now within the quarter, we did have some timing-related benefits, including tax items that contributed to the strength in the EPS line, and we're pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance as well as all key supporting metrics considering this dynamic environment. And importantly, both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare are delivering against their respective commitments. Taking into account the environment, we're being prudent with this attractive full year EPS outlook of at least $2.40, representing over 13% growth near the high end of our long-term average annual EPS growth rate range of 10% to 14%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright : So you called out the strength across specialty and services at Evernorth. I guess, how do we think about the Humira strategy contributing to the results now? And then how does that influence sort of the quarterly progression across Evernorth in the back half of the year? And just the strategy around Humira, and how that's playing out relative to your expectations? Have you, for instance, in-sourced? Humira similar across your CuraScript business. Does it make sense to in-source more than the 50%, for instance, that you're targeting on that front?\nDavid Cordani : It's David. Let me start. You have a lot in your question and appreciate it, given the importance of the space. First, just to reiterate, the Specialty and Care part of the portfolio represents really 30% of our enterprise today. And we're quite excited about the growth potential for that business. We see the product business portfolio as a provision of care business that leverages in many cases, and we're talking about the specialty services. As noted, we had strong growth in the second quarter of 12% and as we discussed for quite some time, the breadth of our capabilities position us well relative to changes in the marketplace, more specifically the biosimilar opportunity. Now you have multiple questions here that I'll ask Eric to peel back a little bit relative to the more specific opportunities we see both in terms of our core business through Accredo as well as through CuraScript as we're expanding our capabilities in our portfolio. Eric?\nEric Palmer : Thanks, David. So, just stepping back a little bit again as well. Biosimilars are really important opportunity to improve the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. And we're really well positioned to help to connect our clients and their customers with these therapies. Our approach here has been consistent in that we offer choice and value to best align with our clients' needs. And we're focused on getting to low net cost fuel and competition and aligning incentives for everyone involved. The patients, our clients, our plan sponsors and the pharma supply chain. As you've made reference to in your question through Quallent Pharmaceuticals, our private label distributor we contracted with multiple manufacturers for interchangeable biosimilar Humira, and this is available at no cost to patients and attractive cost to plan sponsors began shipping this product at the very end of June. So just a few weeks ago, we've already seen meaningful uptake in the last few weeks, consistent with our expectations. We expect the customer adoption to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And it's early, five weeks in, really or so, but we see biosimilars having about a 20% share of our book at this point after just shipping this product for the last five weeks. I've said to overall continue to see that this is a real opportunity for us to improve the affordability of health care for the benefit of our clients and our plan sponsors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nStephen Baxter : One of the questions has been asked, but I wanted to ask about in-group membership trends. It does seem we're starting to see more mixed data on the job front. Could you spike out a little bit what you're seeing in the in group trends? And do you think your sequential membership changes are generally a good reflection of that?\nDavid Cordani : It's David. As we discussed back in 2023, as the year was unfolding, just by way of context, we were very mindful of the potential for some softening of the employer marketplace. And then to your point, in group trends softening a little bit. And when we state of quite close to monitoring it, it didn't really manifests itself in any material way, given employers we're still working to get to a full level of employment. For 2024, we've taken a similar cautious curious monitoring approach and built a little bit of consideration relative to softening. And by and large, we have not seen that to date. So the membership headlines that we've delivered represent good fundamental strength as Brian noted previously, the change in our membership is largely driven by our as expected, dampening of the marketplace, as you would call it, our individual exchange business. But we remain closely monitoring any dampening tied to the economy and thus far haven't seen anything material to call out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies.\nDavid Windley : Brian, in your comments, I think I heard you say that the excess reserves from 1Q have basically developed in line with your expectations. I think I also heard you say that you didn't see any, say, intra quarter trends or a particular month in the quarter that stood out as an anomaly. And I think in looking at our -- your progression looks like MLR implied for the second half is maybe in the neighborhood of 200 basis points above the first half historical normal, maybe about half of that. So just wanted to understand if the higher MLR expectation for the second half is kind of cautious posture or if you're expecting certain things to accelerate in the second half that would drive that. And maybe a last question would be relative to pricing, would you view yourselves as pricing to forward view of trend as you head into next year? Or would you be pricing to expand margin? Another long question.\nBrian Evanko : No problem, Dave. So as it relates to the second half MCR guidance, I think your question was in a year-over-year context. Really, three factors that I'd highlight, if you're looking at it relative to the back half of '23, you may recall from our first quarter earnings release, we discussed that the 2024 seasonality would be more similar to pre-pandemic norms with the MCR increasing as the year unfolded, in part driven by our individual exchange business metal tier mix, which is skewed more bronze this year. Additionally, we had some favorable stop loss utilization in the fourth quarter of 2023 that we are anticipating will normalize in 2024 and our year-to-date experience is consistent with that expectation. And then finally, there is one additional business day in the third quarter of this year, which has some elevation in the MCR in the third quarter specifically for that. So all those factors combined to generate a higher second half MCR year-over-year. But again, we remain comfortable and confident with the full year MCR guidance range that we provided here. As it relates to the pricing environment, and I'll comment specifically on our U.S. employer business, as a reminder, this is a book that's nearly 85% ASO or self-funded. So therefore, we have earnings levers that go well beyond a pure risk-based MCR, but that said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within target margin ranges. And we remain disciplined with our own pricing strategy in the current environment. We continue to price to our best estimate of forward-looking cost trends. To your point, I don't need additional margin recapture at the book level. We are seeing the impact of inflation work its way through our provider contracts. As these contracts renew, we continue to expect elevated levels of utilization through 2024. So when you put all those pieces together, our all-in pricing trend for 2024, slightly higher than what we had assumed a year ago for the corresponding 2023 pricing cycle. And we're confident in our ability to secure appropriate pricing for 2025 and beyond. So a long answer to your long question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Tassan with Piper Sandler.\nJessica Tassan : I'm curious how you're thinking about the possibility that Skyrizi and Rinvoq substitutions could maybe foreclose the Humira biosimilar opportunity? And I guess just what recourse do you have to ensure that the biosimilar products that you've got in the market succeed, I think you've given us plenty of evidence that they're the best for the patients. So just yes, how are you thinking about the possibility of foreclosure and what can you do to kind of prevent or mitigate that?\nEric Palmer : Jessica, it's Eric. So I guess stepping back, our approach is focused on getting -- offering choice and value and getting to the lowest cost and best available solution from a patient perspective. So a couple of things I would note. First of all, our biosimilar offering is interchangeable. And so that facilitates an easier election if a patient chooses to choose a biosimilar, it's an easier process by being interchangeable, so that would be one thing I would note as a differentiator for us. More broadly, we're here to facilitate and ensure patients have access to the medicines that they need. So if the Skyrizi or Rinvoq will be in a position to fulfill that as well. But overall, we're working to make sure that we've got the right access to all of the medication. As we look ahead, ensuring we've got on a fully developed portfolio of all of the available biosimilar offerings will be important, and we'll continue to be in a position to lead here.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.\nLance Wilkes : Could you just give me a little more color on some of the faster growth areas in Evernorth, in particular, if you could talk a little bit about GLP-1 coverage outlook for -- during the selling season for next year, so fee growth has been really strong. How much of that is coming from traditional PBM versus care services growth? And are you seeing any of that in Accredo?\nEric Palmer : It's Eric. So let me start and just talk a little bit about the Encircle and then I'll ask Brian to talk a little bit more about the numerical dimensions of things. So within the Encircle program, we've got over 2 million covered lives at this point. So that's growing nicely. Stepping back a little bit in terms of just looking at the coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss indications overall in the Express Scripts business, we've now got essentially 50% or so of plan sponsors covering for weight loss indications. So we've seen continued incremental growth there. The underlying utilization levels also continue to grow nicely. We've seen growth there, consistent with what you might have seen from an industry growth perspective or things along those lines.\nDavid Cordani : Looking ahead, we expect the use of these medications to continue to grow. And that is part of the growth algorithm for Evernorth overall. Stepping away from GLP-1 specifically, we see broader growth opportunity in specialty with continued growth, both through new therapies through biosimilars coming to market as well as us continuing to expand our relationships whether that's through our CuraScript, specialty distributor or through other direct opportunities. So overall, growth across a number of different fronts within Evernorth that we're pleased to be in a position to deliver. Brian, do you want to pick up the second part of Lance's question?\nBrian Evanko : Sure. So as it relates to the fees and other revenue line in Evernorth, which is up 14% quarter-over-quarter, I think about a number of different areas contributing to the strong performance. contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses are reflected here. So think of EviCore, MDLIVE, our behavioral health business. And then additionally, to the core of your question, we are seeing continued growth in service-based solutions within the pharmacy benefit services business where clients are electing more fee-based orientations with us. So finally, the other contributor to this is the cross enterprise leverage that we're driving with Cigna Healthcare results in revenue from Cigna Healthcare showing up in fees and other revenue in Evernorth and then being eliminated at the corporate level. So all of those contribute to that strong growth in the fees and other revenue line.\nOperator: Thank you. I will turn the call back over to David Cordani for closing remarks.\nDavid Cordani : First, let me thank you all for your engagement today, your time and your questions. I just want to highlight a few headline points. With our momentum, we are confident that we will deliver on our EPS outlook of at least $28.40 for 2024, which represents over a 13% growth rate from 2023. Additionally, before we close, I want to recognize and express appreciation to our 70,000 co-workers across the globe. It's their continued focus, dedication and commitment to support our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners that enable us to deliver on our commitments, including those to you, our shareholders. We're proud of what we've achieved, and we're excited about the opportunities that stand as we look ahead. And as always, we look forward to our future discussions. Have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Cigna Group's second quarter 2024 results review. Cigna Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.

            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review Cigna's second quarter 2024 results and discuss our outlook for the full year. We're pleased with our strong second quarter results, reflecting growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. The results underpin the strength and the stability of our diversified portfolio of businesses in a dynamic environment and demonstrate continued execution against our operating and financial commitments. Key consolidated financial highlights for the second quarter include revenue of $60.5 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72 or 10% year-over-year growth. With the strong first half performance, we continue to have confidence in our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40, which represents more than 13% year-over-year growth in EPS. Now turning to our segment results. I'll first comment on Evernorth. Evernorth continues to deliver strong results driven by both of its operating segments. Second quarter 2024 revenues grew to $49.5 billion, while pretax adjusted earnings grew 7% to $1.6 billion, slightly ahead of expectations. Specialty and Care Services showed strong growth with revenue up 18% to $22.9 billion, and pretax adjusted earnings were up 12% to $756 million, at the high end of our long-term target growth range. This performance is a demonstration of our robust and diversified capabilities, as we delivered broad-based growth across our specialty businesses, Accredo and CuraScript as well as in our care services businesses. Pharmacy Benefit Services also posted strong revenue growth, driven by the addition of new business wins and expansion of existing relationships. Pretax adjusted earnings increased to $798 million as our innovative capabilities continue to drive value for our clients, customers and patients. Overall, we're pleased with Evernorth's second quarter results and continue to expect strong income growth in the second half of the year. Turning to Cigna Healthcare. Second quarter 2024 revenues were $13.2 billion and pretax adjusted earnings were $1.2 billion. Second quarter earnings were in line with expectations and included approximately $50 million of unfavorable prior year impact related to Medicare Advantage risk adjustment. The second quarter medical care ratio of 82.3% was within our expected range, inclusive of the aforementioned unfavorable prior year impact of approximately $50 million or 40 basis points on the medical care ratio. Absent this item, the underlying medical care ratio was broadly in line with expectations. As noted previously, we had planned and priced for 2024 medical cost trend to be above 2023 levels, which took into account both unit cost inflation as well as continued elevated utilization. Year-to-date, we have seen elevated cost trends, consistent with our planning and pricing assumptions. The net medical cost payable at the end of the second quarter was $5.04 billion, compared to $5.66 billion at the end of the first quarter. As noted previously, in the first quarter, we had booked approximately $650 million in incremental reserves relating to the Change Healthcare disruption. Those reserves have since developed in line with expectations and claims payments have returned to more normalized levels. driving the sequential decline in net medical cost payable. Moving to Cigna Healthcare Medical Customers. We ended the quarter with 19 million total medical customers. We expect growth in Cigna Healthcare medical customers for the remainder of the year, primarily driven by growth in our U.S. employer Select and Middle market segments. Overall, Cigna Healthcare delivered consistent results in a dynamic operating environment. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024. With our continued strong underlying performance in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 expectation for consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $8.065 billion or at least $28.40 per share. Regarding cadence of earnings, we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. In Evernorth, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. This reflects continued momentum into the second half, with third quarter Evernorth earnings expected to accelerate to high single-digit year-over-year growth, in part due to an increase in adoption of our interchangeable biosimilar offering. For Cigna Healthcare, we continue to expect full year 2024 pretax adjusted earnings of at least $4.775 billion, and we expect the third quarter adjusted earnings to be approximately 25% of the full year outlook. We continue to expect the full year medical care ratio within the range of 81.7% to 82.5%. With the first half medical care ratio coming in at 81.1%, the midpoint of our guidance implies an 83.1% medical care ratio for the second half of the year. We would expect the third quarter to be slightly below that level. Turning to our 2024 capital management position. As of July 31, we have repurchased 14.7 million shares of common stock or approximately $5 billion, consistent with our previous commentary. We continue to expect at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations. Our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains strong, benefiting from our efficient asset-light framework that drives attractive returns on capital. Now to recap. Our first half 2024 consolidated results reflect strong contributions and execution from both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Our 2024 outlook reflects the sustained momentum and strong fundamentals of our two growth platforms, which gives us confidence to deliver on our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share outlook of at least $28.40. With that, we'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A portion of the call. Justin, it's Brian. So I'll start by saying we're pleased to have delivered another solid quarter of MCR performance at Cigna Healthcare which ran toward the lower end of our MCR guidance range when you exclude the prior year Medicare risk adjustment revenue impacts in the quarter that I mentioned earlier. Now within the quarter, total cost of care was broadly in line with expectations. There are a few puts and takes that I call out if we get into specific cost drivers. So we continue to see elevated usage of facility-based services, including emergency room. Additionally, we saw a continuation of elevated utilization of mental health care services, which we do see as a positive over the longer term given the correlation to whole person health. You'll recall in the first quarter, I highlighted slowing growth in surgical costs. During the second quarter, we continued to see abatement in the rate of growth of surgical costs although costs still didn't grow. Now taken all together, we are seeing sustained high cost trends, yet these are broadly in line with our guidance as we planned and priced for the elevated utilization levels that began in 2023 to continue throughout 2024. Now specifically in the second quarter, we did not witness aggregate acceleration or deceleration of care patterns within the quarter. I also would not note any month-to-month variability relative to the year-to-date experience that we've seen. So overall, we remain confident in the full year MCR range outlined in our guidance. A.J., it's Brian. I'll start on the Cigna Healthcare selling season and buying pattern dynamic. And then I think David will pick up on the second part of your question relative to point solutions and some of our inorganic activities. So as it relates to the Cigna Healthcare selling season, I'll concentrate my comments on the larger end of the U.S. employer market just given the time of the year. We're seeing a relatively consistent number of RFPs this year in comparison to last year at this time. And similarly, in terms of our existing clients, we have a similar amount out to bid as we did last year at this time. So, just for some context on the numbers. Now each of these larger employer clients tend to have unique needs. There's a few areas that thematically I'd call out in terms of what our teams are seeing out in the market. One, as David made reference to earlier, affordability continues to be a key area of focus particularly with the wave of drug innovation, including GLP-1s and gene therapy hitting the market. Secondly, to your point, some of the larger employers are seeking to consolidate vendors or point solutions with those who can supply more integrated offerings. Third, we're seeing mental health and substance of these benefits and programs becoming more and more important each year, particularly given some of the downstream effects of the pandemic. And finally, many of these larger clients are interested in digitally enabled care navigation capabilities to drive either further study care optimization or consumer empowerment. So taken all together, our Cigna Healthcare offerings are well positioned to address these themes and demands from large employers. And importantly, we also continue to see strong traction in net growth in our under 500 Select segment as you'll see in the statistical supplement, 7% year-over-year growth in customers within our Cigna Healthcare Select segment specifically. David, maybe you want to pick up on the point solution question? Scott, it's Brian. Maybe I'll try to just take a big picture view of the individual exchange business in aggregate and hit your risk adjustment question as part of that. So the headline I'd ask you to take away broadly speaking, our individual exchange book is performing as we expected in 2024. As it relates to the final 2023 individual exchange risk-adjusted true-up, we had already been accrued for a sizable risk adjustment payable. And in the second quarter results, we did have a small unfavorable true-up that was recorded in the Cigna Healthcare P&L. But overall, this was not a meaningful performance driver in the second quarter for us. And then as it relates to the 2024 performance year, we did receive our first look at the industry-wide risk adjustment data for the specific states we participate, as we closed up the second quarter books and the preliminary industry data confirmed that our previous 2024 risk adjustment assumptions were reasonable. My earlier commentary on cost trends was broadly applicable to the individual exchange business as well. So when you put all the pieces together, we are tracking toward the improved 2024 margin profile we outlined during our first quarter call. And therefore, we'd expect to land the year slightly below our long-term target margin range of 4% to 6% for the individual exchange business. Ryan, it's Brian. Congratulations on your new role. As it relates to the individual exchange lives intra year, maybe I'll just step back and give you kind of a year-to-date perspective, and then I'll get into the sequential component of your question. So as we discussed during our first quarter results call, the primary driver of the year-to-date change in Cigna Healthcare customer volumes is our individual exchange book. You'll recall that we repositioned this business in 2024, including taking some needed pricing actions in certain geographies in order to improve profitability and we expected to see a reduction in customer volumes as we have witnessed. And sequentially, the individual exchange business drove the majority of the modest decline in the second quarter customer volumes. Now you should think of the primary driver of that being non-payment of premiums as a result of some of the pricing actions we took in a couple of the larger geographies. So it's essentially the delayed effect of those grace periods kicking in. It was an immaterial impact to our financial results in the quarter. Over the course of the balance of this year, we would expect to see continued strong growth within our U.S. employer under 500 Select segment, which should result in sequential growth in U.S. employer and Cigna Healthcare lives for the balance of the year. So taken all together, we're pleased with the overall balance in the Cigna Healthcare portfolio. As it relates to 2025 in the picture there, we've just recently completed all the pricing and rate filings network design. And until we really see all the competitive dynamics, it's hard to know how that will shake through we would expect our margins to be similar or potentially a little bit better next year in the individual exchange book as we look forward. But too early to know exactly how we'll shake out from a membership standpoint. Josh, it's Brian. I'll take that one as well. So we see the ICRA market in its current form is likely being a niche market, but one that we're monitoring closely. So more specifically, we see the ICRA market as something that could be in a feeling option for smaller employers who tend to be more commoditized buyers. And we expect this is most likely to be an attractive option for employers with less than 50 employees, which is a market segment that is financially immaterial for us today. And within the under 50 market, the average employer there has fewer than 10 employees, so very small employers typically. Now all that said, our individual exchange business represents an opportunity for us to participate in the ICRA space, should it gain more momentum? Again, I didn't know where I started and that we see this most likely being a niche market our stop-loss offerings, to your question, are fully integrated with our Select segment business. So you should not think of that as something that is a net threat to us in the select market provided that the under 50 concentration transpires the way that I described earlier. Adam, it's Brian. So first off, we're pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of results on both the top and bottom lines with overall results slightly ahead of our expectations in the second quarter. Now within the quarter, we did have some timing-related benefits, including tax items that contributed to the strength in the EPS line, and we're pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance as well as all key supporting metrics considering this dynamic environment. And importantly, both Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare are delivering against their respective commitments. Taking into account the environment, we're being prudent with this attractive full year EPS outlook of at least $2.40, representing over 13% growth near the high end of our long-term average annual EPS growth rate range of 10% to 14%. No problem, Dave. So as it relates to the second half MCR guidance, I think your question was in a year-over-year context. Really, three factors that I'd highlight, if you're looking at it relative to the back half of '23, you may recall from our first quarter earnings release, we discussed that the 2024 seasonality would be more similar to pre-pandemic norms with the MCR increasing as the year unfolded, in part driven by our individual exchange business metal tier mix, which is skewed more bronze this year. Additionally, we had some favorable stop loss utilization in the fourth quarter of 2023 that we are anticipating will normalize in 2024 and our year-to-date experience is consistent with that expectation. And then finally, there is one additional business day in the third quarter of this year, which has some elevation in the MCR in the third quarter specifically for that. So all those factors combined to generate a higher second half MCR year-over-year. But again, we remain comfortable and confident with the full year MCR guidance range that we provided here. As it relates to the pricing environment, and I'll comment specifically on our U.S. employer business, as a reminder, this is a book that's nearly 85% ASO or self-funded. So therefore, we have earnings levers that go well beyond a pure risk-based MCR, but that said, our U.S. employer book is currently operating from a position of strength as we've been performing within target margin ranges. And we remain disciplined with our own pricing strategy in the current environment. We continue to price to our best estimate of forward-looking cost trends. To your point, I don't need additional margin recapture at the book level. We are seeing the impact of inflation work its way through our provider contracts. As these contracts renew, we continue to expect elevated levels of utilization through 2024. So when you put all those pieces together, our all-in pricing trend for 2024, slightly higher than what we had assumed a year ago for the corresponding 2023 pricing cycle. And we're confident in our ability to secure appropriate pricing for 2025 and beyond. So a long answer to your long question. Sure. So as it relates to the fees and other revenue line in Evernorth, which is up 14% quarter-over-quarter, I think about a number of different areas contributing to the strong performance. contributions from our Evernorth Care businesses are reflected here. So think of EviCore, MDLIVE, our behavioral health business. And then additionally, to the core of your question, we are seeing continued growth in service-based solutions within the pharmacy benefit services business where clients are electing more fee-based orientations with us. So finally, the other contributor to this is the cross enterprise leverage that we're driving with Cigna Healthcare results in revenue from Cigna Healthcare showing up in fees and other revenue in Evernorth and then being eliminated at the corporate level. So all of those contribute to that strong growth in the fees and other revenue line."

            "name": "David Cordani",
            "content": "Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the second quarter, we again delivered strong performance as we continue to build on our momentum. Today, I'll discuss our performance for the quarter and key strategic drivers of our growth, demonstrate how the strength and durable nature of our model is fueling our success. Then Brian will review additional details on our results and our outlook for the rest of the year, and we'll move to your questions. So let's get started. For the second quarter, I'm pleased to report that the Cigna Group delivered total revenue of $60.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $6.72. We achieved these positive overall results in a dynamic environment, and I'm proud of our team for continuing to focus on those we serve, ensuring that they get care of the need, to get their medications at an affordable cost and they get the support they need in order to make the best decisions about their health and vitality. All of this requires a relentless focus on innovation, disciplined execution and a passionate commitment to our mission. During the quarter, our Evernorth Health Service businesses demonstrated continued strength with our market-leading specialty and pharmacy benefit services capabilities. Within Evernorth, I'll start with our accelerated growth specialty and care businesses, which provides specialty drugs for the treatment of complex and rare diseases, distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals as well as clinical programs to help clients improve health and vitality. We saw strong growth in the quarter with adjusted income growing 12% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand for our services while we also continue to invest in broadening our offerings and expanding our reach. In Accredo, our specialty business, our growth continues to be fueled by secular tailwinds as well as Accredo's differentiated strength which makes us the market leader in the space. Biosimilars, for example, represent a force of change and a substantial opportunity for continued growth and impact. At the end of June, we began dispensing our interchangeable biosimilar for Humira. Our program has zero dollar out-of-pocket cost for patients, saving them on average $3,500 per year. To deliver these savings, we have agreements in place with multiple manufacturers that will produce biosimilars for Evernorth pharmaceutical distributor, Quallent Pharmaceuticals. Now the biosimilar opportunity goes well beyond Humira. By 2030, we expect an additional $100 million of annual specialty drug spend in the U.S. will be subject to biosimilar and generic competition. And Accredo is well positioned to deliver differentiated value for our clients, customers and patients. In our care services businesses, we are continuing to grow and expand in key areas of increased demand, including behavioral health, virtual and home care. For example, in summer, we further expanded Evernorth behavioral care group to an additional seven states. We are seeing positive patient outcomes from our unique clinician matching capabilities based on individual needs and preferences with fully 84% of patients experiencing clinically significant reductions in the depression and anxiety symptoms. Now shifting to Express Scripts, our foundational pharmacy benefit services businesses, we are seeing continued strong client demand given our breadth of clinical and supply chain expertise as well as our proven partnership orientation. This quarter, Express Scripts built on a long track record of innovating for those we serve with continued enhancements and new solutions. For example, given the high cost of GLP-1 drugs, we're continuing to see meaningful interest from our clients in EnCircleRx, now with more than 2 million lives already enrolled. Our program starts with our longitudinal data to target patients who will most benefit from these medications and we provide patients with resources to make lasting changes to help maximize the effectiveness of these medications, both in the short and long-term. Another example of our innovation orientation is a recent announcement of Express Scripts oncology benefit services, which will be available in 2025. Our new solution helps patients navigate the challenges of cancer care by providing a single oncology benefit, integrating pharmacy, medical and behavioral health treatments. Our patient centered approach will help to ensure the earliest possible detection guide individuals to high-quality providers and coordinate care across clinical teams. Now moving to Cigna Healthcare, our health benefits platform, we continue to deliver solutions that create value and better outcomes for clients and customers, coupled with highly competitive total cost of care. Similar to others in the industry and as we've anticipated, we are seeing increased utilization in our book of business. I would note that our results are largely in line with the elevated levels in our planning and pricing assumptions. Our U.S. employer foundational growth business continues to perform in line with our expectations. Over this year, I've met with hundreds of clients across the U.S. and globally. And while the needs of every client are unique, there are a few consistent themes across every discussion. First, continued focus on affordability, particularly in light medications like GLP-1 and gene therapies coming to market. Next, an increased need of improved access and importantly, coordination of behavioral health services. Third is mounting point solution fatigue. And fourth, the opportunity and need for leverage of our longitudinal data and clinical programs to help keep people healthy and vital. Our solutions continue to resonate well given our highly consultative approach to help clients choose the right set of solutions, our proven capabilities to support their workforce and our innovative programs that help to keep costs down. As a result, we are further gaining share and continue to see outsized opportunities, for example, in our Select segment. Another capability of our U.S. employer business to deliver integrated and tailored benefits for our clients and customers, our modular solutions that incorporate innovative services from Evernorth, including Behavioral health, virtual care and pharmacy. Our Pathwell suite of solution, which continues to drive exceptional value is a prime example. Pathwell specialty is another way we are reducing costs associated with specialty drug therapies, while also providing improved care and clinical outcomes for patients. With our Accredo nurses, nearly 50% of our Pathwell specialty patients, who've transitioned their site of care, now receive treatment in the comfort and convenience of their home. We are pleased with how the market continues to recognize the value we are delivering through solutions like Pathwell. Turning to our Medicare Advantage business. We continue to make great progress regarding the sale of this business, and I'm pleased that we remain on track to close in the first quarter of 2025 as planned. Next, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the current environment surrounding pharmacy benefit managers and the relative landscape. At the heart of this debate is the cost of pharmaceuticals. As we previously discussed, a key force of change in health care is the surge of pharmacological innovation. For context, prescription drug coverage is the most frequently used care benefit. And on average, it used 15x per year per person resulting in billions of dollars -- billions of prescriptions per year annually in the United States. Today, and for the foreseeable future, and most meaningful advances extending and improving quality of life will come through gene therapies, breakthrough and treatments for cancers and other conditions as well as personalized medicines. In the U.S., for example, there are already more than 20 gene therapy and cell therapies available. However, there are nearly 1,000 more in the pipeline. Additionally, as we know, GLP-1s are growing rapidly, helping to treat diseases and complications that stem from obesity and diabetes. This class of drug is on tap to be the #1 pharmacy benefit trend driver for plans of all sizes this year. And the impact will grow with some forecasting nearly 10% of the U.S. population using GLP-1s in the next 10 years or sooner. The applications rippling from these fast-growing pharmaceutical trends across the entire health care system are undeniable. And one of the biggest unanswered questions is how could society afford this continued trajectory? Our role is to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as pharmacies to ensure that individuals are able to access pharmacological innovations at a fair and affordable price. In fact, pharmacy benefit companies are the only part of the drug supply chain who work to drive cost down. To underscore this, new drugs coming to market with unsustainable prices in 2023, were up $300,000 on a median basis, up over 35% over 2022. And last year, median brand drug price increases were greater than 5% more than the rate of inflation. Let me repeat this. Last year, the median annual price for new drugs coming to market was $300,000, up 35% over 2022. Meanwhile, in 2023, Express Scripts change in pace and cost sharing was relatively flat on average. Express Scripts patients with employer sponsored drug coverage pay, on average, $15 out of pocket for a 30 day supply. And for clients, Express Scripts delivered more than $38 billion in savings annually. Stepping back, our industry negotiations to drive these results can at times generate friction in the system. Friction that is spilled into and now has reached tightened levels in the political arena and media with industry winners and losers being declared at every report and every headline. We believe that the facts and results and outcomes delivered to our clients, customers and patients will rule the day. However, the environment calls on us to be more proactive. This means ensuring that what we do and the value we bring is more widely and better understood. And we continue to evolve our model to address legitimate pain points and opportunities. For example, in 2023, 1% of the patients in the United States experienced out-of-pocket costs above $2,000 a year. From our point of view, that's too many. We accept the responsibility to accelerate innovation to make medications more affordable, while continuing to improve health outcomes in finding solutions for every person we serve. Make no doubt our team will continue to lean into the challenge for the benefit of our patients, clients and the health care ecosystem and we are proud of the work that our team does every day and the role we play and the results we're able to achieve. Now let me pause and summarize before transitioning to Brian. When you combine our compelling growth potential and strong execution focus, we have confidence in our ability to meet our 2024 and long-term growth targets. We have a proven track record of delivering differentiated value for those we serve by innovating new solutions like in EnCircleRx and our Pathwell suite as well as expanding meaningful partnerships. As a result, in the second quarter, we delivered on our financial commitment with adjusted EPS of $6.72, and we remain on track to deliver our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $28.40 for 2024. Further, our company has attractive sustainable growth opportunities over the long-term, and we remain on track to deliver average annual adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% and building on our track record of achieving 13% adjusted EPS growth over the last decade, all while we generate cumulative operating cash flow of $60 billion over the next five years, while continuing to meaningfully invest capital for the benefit of shareholders. We also continue to make strategic investments in strengthening our capabilities in our foundational and accelerated growth business and remain focusing on harnessing the breadth of our capabilities of our organization to meet the evolving needs of those we serve. Overall, our strong performance through the first half of the year reflects the balance in our company portfolio and the significant value creation that positions us for sustained and differentiated growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. I appreciate the call out. First and foremost, let me reiterate we're proud of the work we do daily, and I'm greatly appreciative of our team that gets up everyday serving our patients and customers through employer relationships, health plane relationships, governmental entity relationships and increasingly through partnerships and collaborations to health care professionals. Second, we will and need to continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve, whether that's through the likes of ClearCareRx, our patient insurance program, our EnCircle program, our independent pharmacy program, all of which are first in the space. Now specific to your question, we challenged ourselves to be much more aggressive and complete relative to communication and engagement in support of our clients, be they employers or health buying customers collaborate even more deeply and intensely with the independent pharmacies and subsegmenting the independent pharmacists who are truly independent and rural working on the hill, of course. And then lastly, more aggressively leveraging credible third-party independent analysis of what our industry does and specifically what we do on behalf of those we serve in a fact-based incredible way. So you should expect to see us a bit more complete and aggressive ensuring that we're amplifying that. But make no doubt, we also need to continue to innovate as we have, and we will continue to innovate for the benefit of those we serve. Sure. So first, if you think about some of the solutions we identified both in today's call and in prior conversations, you can think about our digital health formulary, as a way that we connect capabilities and work to connect them seamlessly. You can think about the way the Encircle program is designed. It's designed to have actually coordination and continuity that is patient-centric the oncology program that we will roll out in 2025 is another example of taking specific care need or episode of care and redesigning the pathway to care in a much more coordinated basis, staying focused on the patient and the health care professional. The Cigna Behavioral Group offering that I referenced has much more continuity and coordination of the care experience, starting from the access to the medical professional, the matching and the coordination and there'll be new offerings. You can think about all those as largely having been built organically as we continue to invest back in the organization. To the core question through acquisition, you could think about that as well, you never roll it out largely not fueled through acquisition, although there could be episodic coordination of point solutions. And then I would graph in the middle, I'd remind you that we operate the Cigna Ventures organization where we have a now meaningful track record of partnering with organizations where they are, by definition, almost point solutions and helping collaboratively to co-innovate with them as we go forward. So stepping back, largely organically driven proven track record and the acceleration of new innovations that are coming to market for the benefit of those we serve to meet that demand. Andrew, it's David. Let me comment briefly on the PDP macro environment and then ask Eric to walk through our capabilities and our proven track record of supporting our clients relative to their PDP offerings. As you step back, it was clear that the Inflation Reduction Act as it was designed and the ultimate implementation of it was going to cause PDP premiums to rise meaningfully. And most likely, that was going to create some meaningful disruption for seniors. Now as the bids have gone in, CMS has assessed those bids and has drawn apparently some of the similar conclusions relative to the acceleration of the bids and the acceleration of the premiums required given the design features. And after reviewing those has created a short-term window for some bid adjustments that we and like others are going through that on an accelerated basis. So that disruption was designed from the Inflation Reduction Act in the marketplace is reacting to that. Mok Eric to talk more specifically to our capabilities and how we work and supportive in many cases, our health plan clients in their PDP book of business to ensure we deliver great quality and overall affordability. Eric? It's David. Let me start. You have a lot in your question and appreciate it, given the importance of the space. First, just to reiterate, the Specialty and Care part of the portfolio represents really 30% of our enterprise today. And we're quite excited about the growth potential for that business. We see the product business portfolio as a provision of care business that leverages in many cases, and we're talking about the specialty services. As noted, we had strong growth in the second quarter of 12% and as we discussed for quite some time, the breadth of our capabilities position us well relative to changes in the marketplace, more specifically the biosimilar opportunity. Now you have multiple questions here that I'll ask Eric to peel back a little bit relative to the more specific opportunities we see both in terms of our core business through Accredo as well as through CuraScript as we're expanding our capabilities in our portfolio. Eric? It's David. As we discussed back in 2023, as the year was unfolding, just by way of context, we were very mindful of the potential for some softening of the employer marketplace. And then to your point, in group trends softening a little bit. And when we state of quite close to monitoring it, it didn't really manifests itself in any material way, given employers we're still working to get to a full level of employment. For 2024, we've taken a similar cautious curious monitoring approach and built a little bit of consideration relative to softening. And by and large, we have not seen that to date. So the membership headlines that we've delivered represent good fundamental strength as Brian noted previously, the change in our membership is largely driven by our as expected, dampening of the marketplace, as you would call it, our individual exchange business. But we remain closely monitoring any dampening tied to the economy and thus far haven't seen anything material to call out there. Looking ahead, we expect the use of these medications to continue to grow. And that is part of the growth algorithm for Evernorth overall. Stepping away from GLP-1 specifically, we see broader growth opportunity in specialty with continued growth, both through new therapies through biosimilars coming to market as well as us continuing to expand our relationships whether that's through our CuraScript, specialty distributor or through other direct opportunities. So overall, growth across a number of different fronts within Evernorth that we're pleased to be in a position to deliver. Brian, do you want to pick up the second part of Lance's question? First, let me thank you all for your engagement today, your time and your questions. I just want to highlight a few headline points. With our momentum, we are confident that we will deliver on our EPS outlook of at least $28.40 for 2024, which represents over a 13% growth rate from 2023. Additionally, before we close, I want to recognize and express appreciation to our 70,000 co-workers across the globe. It's their continued focus, dedication and commitment to support our clients, our customers, our patients and our partners that enable us to deliver on our commitments, including those to you, our shareholders. We're proud of what we've achieved, and we're excited about the opportunities that stand as we look ahead. And as always, we look forward to our future discussions. Have a great day. Thanks."

            "content": "Lisa, it's Eric. I'll start then maybe invite David to add some additional comments on the end here. But overall, our foundational pharmacy benefit services business, Express Scripts is off to a really good start for 2025. We've got strong new sales and our 2025 retention rate is going to be consistent with three years and the mid-90s or better. Stepping back a little bit, Evernorth overall is -- continues to be well positioned to grow. The specialty business is also positioned for strong growth with significant growth driven by our pharmacy benefits clients electing to use our specialty capabilities as well as strong growth in services sold directly to health systems and other health plans. So overall, we are quite excited about the strength of the solutions and how they continue to resonate with the market overall. The themes or specific programs that I would point to come back to areas that help to make the value of the dollar spent on medicine is more effective, right? So programs like our EnCircleRx program that helps to effectively manage weight loss medication GLP-1 or our most recent oncology benefit offering that David mentioned a bit ago in his prepared remarks. So targeted specific types of programs that work really well with the broader suite of benefit offerings continue to resonate really well in that scenario we continue to invest in. David, do you want to take a bit on the broader environment comment? Evernorth and Express Scripts specifically has a long history of supporting health plans to offer Medicare Part D plans. We've got a great track record of a treatment and strong stars outcomes for them and supporting our plans and their offerings and helping them with the tools to manage formularies and model the impacts of changes for example. We're continuing to make investments to help ensure our plans are well positioned with the continued evolution of Part D coverage. We even with the most recent round of changes from the IRA like the administrative requirements associated with the copay smoothing just as one example. This continues to be an important part of the Evernorth and Express Scripts business that we're positioned to continue to help our plans succeed and thrive as they work through these changes. George, it's Eric. First, I'm going to comment on any specific negotiations with any pharmacies or things along those lines. But as you know, we've got a wide array of choices and options for our clients. That extends to how we've constructed our network as we look to balance access and affordability that best meets the needs of our clients and their patients. So we work to assemble a range of different network options under a range of different reimbursement types that match up with the needs for cost access and the associated trade-offs and touch there for our clients. So overall, that approach has served us well. We work to continue to innovate to bring new solutions to market. An example of a new solution there would be like late last year, we announced our ClearNetwork Solution. ClearNetwork provides a comprehensive simple solution in that, the pricing is based off of independent, externally created index and then it's got a simple margin that's shared between us and the pharmacy. So it's a new offering we put in the market last year that's generating interest. But again, overall, the portfolio of offerings that we continue to pull together resonates with our buyers and is part of the reason we've continued to grow the pharmacy benefits services, chassis nicely over the last few years. Thanks, David. So, just stepping back a little bit again as well. Biosimilars are really important opportunity to improve the affordability of these high-cost specialty medicines. And we're really well positioned to help to connect our clients and their customers with these therapies. Our approach here has been consistent in that we offer choice and value to best align with our clients' needs. And we're focused on getting to low net cost fuel and competition and aligning incentives for everyone involved. The patients, our clients, our plan sponsors and the pharma supply chain. As you've made reference to in your question through Quallent Pharmaceuticals, our private label distributor we contracted with multiple manufacturers for interchangeable biosimilar Humira, and this is available at no cost to patients and attractive cost to plan sponsors began shipping this product at the very end of June. So just a few weeks ago, we've already seen meaningful uptake in the last few weeks, consistent with our expectations. We expect the customer adoption to continue to grow over the balance of the year. And it's early, five weeks in, really or so, but we see biosimilars having about a 20% share of our book at this point after just shipping this product for the last five weeks. I've said to overall continue to see that this is a real opportunity for us to improve the affordability of health care for the benefit of our clients and our plan sponsors. Jessica, it's Eric. So I guess stepping back, our approach is focused on getting -- offering choice and value and getting to the lowest cost and best available solution from a patient perspective. So a couple of things I would note. First of all, our biosimilar offering is interchangeable. And so that facilitates an easier election if a patient chooses to choose a biosimilar, it's an easier process by being interchangeable, so that would be one thing I would note as a differentiator for us. More broadly, we're here to facilitate and ensure patients have access to the medicines that they need. So if the Skyrizi or Rinvoq will be in a position to fulfill that as well. But overall, we're working to make sure that we've got the right access to all of the medication. As we look ahead, ensuring we've got on a fully developed portfolio of all of the available biosimilar offerings will be important, and we'll continue to be in a position to lead here. It's Eric. So let me start and just talk a little bit about the Encircle and then I'll ask Brian to talk a little bit more about the numerical dimensions of things. So within the Encircle program, we've got over 2 million covered lives at this point. So that's growing nicely. Stepping back a little bit in terms of just looking at the coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss indications overall in the Express Scripts business, we've now got essentially 50% or so of plan sponsors covering for weight loss indications. So we've seen continued incremental growth there. The underlying utilization levels also continue to grow nicely. We've seen growth there, consistent with what you might have seen from an industry growth perspective or things along those lines."

        "content": "Kevin Fischbeck: All right. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be hosting The Cigna Group. Presenting today, we have Brian Evanko, who is the CFO of the company as well as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. We also have Hasan Riaz and Ralph Giacobbe for the company as well in the audience. So I think we should jump right into Q&A. I guess maybe take us -- one of the things that we're trying to figure out here at the conference is just kind of the backdrop for utilization. There's a lot of moving pieces and seems like some degree, different points of view about where we are in the utilization perspective. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing utilization, I guess, first in the core commercial book but then also any color on the Medicare Advantage side as well?\nBrian Evanko: Sure, Kevin. And thanks to you and Bank of America for hosting us here this week. As it relates to utilization, in 2023 across the board, we saw strong levels of utilization in our Cigna Healthcare health plan book, which is something we had priced for, guided for and included in our projections. And so as a result of that, you would have seen we had a strong year in Cigna Healthcare in 2023. The MCR performance was strong. The revenue growth was strong, in spite of what were elevated levels of utilization compared to 2020, 2021, 2022. So '23 was a stronger year of utilization. As we stepped into '24, we assumed those strong levels of utilization would continue through the entire year. So our pricing anticipated that, our guidance anticipated that and our projections did as well. So we are pleased with our first quarter results coming in better than expectations in Cigna Healthcare, where the MCR was better than we had projected and also the income was ahead of expectations, which again we come back to the firm pricing that we've had in the market, 2024 reflecting that utilization, is consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. So far, the second quarter is largely in line with what we had expected coming out of the first quarter, which again is persistently high utilization levels relative to what we had in '23. In the first quarter, we had strong levels of inpatient utilization, a little bit of decelerating outpatient and surgery utilization, but still at high levels in absolute terms. So that's broadly how I would think about the picture we're seeing at The Cigna group.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. And any different color on the Medicare Advantage side versus the commercial side?\nBrian Evanko: The Medicare Advantage book for us and granted we only have about 600,000 lives, so it may not be representative of the nation, has been broadly in line with our projections. Strong levels of utilization, '23 persisted through the first quarter of '24. So I wouldn't call it out as a significant outlier relative to our commercial employer experience.\nKevin Fischbeck: And I guess let's talk about the commercial side for a minute. I mean, you're one of the few companies that really talks about commercial as a growth business. And to your credit, you have been growing commercial well. I mean, but what is the opportunity that you guys see in the marketplace overall? What type of growth can you think you can deliver in commercial?\nBrian Evanko: Yes, if you step back and think about the company in total, we've got three scaled growth platforms. We've got Cigna Healthcare, which is our health plan business. That's about 40% of our income. And our commercial employer business is the cornerstone in Cigna Healthcare. We've got our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services platform, which is about 30% of the company, which we expect to grow 8% to 12% per year on average. And then we have our Pharmacy Benefits Services business in Evernorth, that's about 30% of the company that we expect low- to mid-single-digit type growth on an ongoing basis. So three large scaled platforms. You asked specifically about the commercial employer business that's in Cigna Healthcare, which again is our health plan business. We've had a long track record of success here and part of it's the focus and the expertise that we've built up over time. But the opportunity we have going forward for disproportionately high growth is in the under 500 employer size segment, what we call the Select segment. So you can think of this employers who have between 50 and 500 employees. Today, we have about 7% market share. That's up from it was 5% just five years ago. So our share has been gradually building and we see the opportunity for that to eventually get into the double-digits from share standpoint, which is where our over 500 market share is today in the commercial employer space. We see that as a significant opportunity going forward. The reason we've been successful in that space is both improved affordability at a local market level, but also a very consultative model, that we've employed with employers from the standpoint of understanding how health benefits can be a weapon for them relative to talent attraction and retention and the fact that we're agnostic to funding arrangements. So we've for a long time had ASO or self-funded arrangements in the down market segment, which some of our competitors have been reluctant to do because it's lower revenue, even though it's very attractive from a profitability standpoint. So that's the subsegment within commercial employer that we're most excited about growth going forward.\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes, I guess in Q1 when I looked at your commercial membership, the membership was down pretty much in every segment except for I guess the Select business. So what happened there? Why weren't we seeing better membership trends when the economy is doing relatively well? And then how should we think about the rest of the year?\nBrian Evanko: Yes, the Select segment, I'll come back to the core of the question, the Select segment, you can think of as having more rolling renewal dates. So because these are smaller employers, they're -- it's not as concentrated on January 1st. So we tend to see intra-year growth, in that sub-segment specifically, so the under-500 Select segment. So we'll see throughout the year growth, in terms of sequential lives into 2024. As it relates to your point on the larger segments, if you look at our middle markets and national accounts, we did have some self-funded fee based clients that were lost for 1124. We knew about that because from the standpoint of the pricing environment, we didn't chase the pricing. So not material to our income, but they did create a dent to the lives on 1124. Now that's on the heels of a couple of years of really strong growth. If you go back and look at where we were at the end of '21, our commercial employer book now is much bigger, 2 million, 3 million lives bigger. So it's we've had a lot of growth. But in this specific time period, we had a couple of known employer losses, Kevin.\nKevin Fischbeck: And so then does that mean that the market's getting more competitive in that marketplace or is this just digesting recent growth?\nBrian Evanko: Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as more competitive in general because these are only -- there were two significant fee based clients. So out of the 100s that we serve in that space, I wouldn't necessarily conclude it's more competitive. We're broadly seeing rational pricing from our competitors. But here and there, you'll see a situation, where the pricing is a bit aggressive.\nKevin Fischbeck: And so as far as the rest of the year goes, do you expect membership to kind of trend up from here as the year goes on, is that?\nBrian Evanko: We do. In the employer business, we expect there to be intra-year growth in the lives such that the full-year commercial employer book, year-end '24 versus year-end '23 should be flat to potentially up a bit.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. And then you guys are getting out of the Medicare Advantage business and you don't have a Medicaid business. Can you just talk about your views on the government business? Like why isn't that part of your portfolio strategy today? And it seems like almost every company has a diversified portfolio. Aren't there benefits of having that?\nBrian Evanko: There's a few different questions in there, so maybe I'll try to go deliberately through this to make sure the audience understands all the pieces in our thought process. So to your point, we're in the process of divesting our Medicare businesses as we speak to HCSC on track for early 2025 closing date of that. We've completed the DOJ review process. We got through the federal antitrust review already, so a couple of key milestones have already been met. Again, on track to deliver that divestiture in the first quarter or early part of 2025. Stepping back, though, why would we divest the business, I think is more where you were going with the question. We continue to see the Medicare subsector of the U.S. healthcare space as an attractive part of the U.S. healthcare market. So this was not a verdict about Medicare not being an attractive subsector. But for us, relative to where The Cigna Group is positioned, our strengths, our existing assets and where we can create the most value, we concluded that given its relatively small size in our portfolio, the amount of human capital and financial investment that would be required to scale it to a level that's significant for our company was too tall of a task and that it was best in someone else's hands. So that's what led to the decision to divest the business. So this was not a verdict about the Medicare market. It was relative to the size of our company and the things that we're prioritizing and focusing in. So I talked about specialty pharmacy earlier, our commercial employer business and the strength in our Pharmacy Benefits Services platforms. Those are getting disproportionate investment resources and we have a sustained right to win in each of them. Now, stepping back from that, our Evernorth Health Services business serves a lot of Medicare lives today. We serve a lot of Medicaid lives today, particularly with the win of Centene that has now gone effective, January 1st into our book. So we now serve 20 million or so so customers of Centene across Medicaid, Medicare and across the entire Evernorth portfolio. About 30% of all the customers we serve there are government sponsored: Medicaid, Medicare, DoD. So between our Pharmacy Benefits Services, specialty pharmacy, we serve a lot of Medicare, Medicaid, government lives, but through the services chassis as opposed to the health plan chassis. So in the long run, not having a health plan presence presents an opportunity for us strategically, something we could consider. It's not necessarily in the near-term where we're going to be focused, but it's an opportunity in the long-term for us to consider.\nKevin Fischbeck: Is that true for Medicaid as well as Medicare or do you have a different view about those programs?\nBrian Evanko: Similarly to Medicare, after the divestiture, we won't have any health plan presence in Cigna Healthcare. And as we go through our strategic reviews of any decision that we make, we'll assess Medicare, Medicaid and other lines where we're not active. So I wouldn't say we have a stronger view of one versus the other in terms of the relative attractiveness. Ultimately, it'll come back to, as we think about the criteria for where we invest or the criteria for M&A, each of the specific situations would need to be -- need to be carefully reviewed. We have concluded that we don't intend to organically enter Medicaid or Medicare. So if we are in those lines in the health plan business, it would be through some sort of acquisition down the line.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Can we talk a little bit about Evernorth then for a minute? You guys have kind of broken out that PBM business separately from the special two business. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to do that and why you think that's important for investors to understand?\nBrian Evanko: Sure. Yes, so starting in the first quarter, we divided the Evernorth business into two operating segments or subsegments. And again, stepping back, Evernorth is a health services platform for Cigna. It's about 60% of our income. And then Cigna Healthcare is the health plan, about 40%. So the 60% we divided into the two components. And part of this was we had a lot of questions coming in from investors to help us understand the pieces better. But also part of it is we wanted to make sure, we really put a spotlight on the Specialty and Care Services platform, which can you think of each of them as approximately equal today in terms of their contribution, 30% of the total company's income from both of those two operating segments. We found many people were taking our specialty pharmacy business and grouping it with the rest of our Pharmacy Benefits Services business and just thinking of that as a prescription drug oriented business. Yes, the two have very different growth profiles going forward. So the Specialty and Care Services business, $400 billion addressable market, it'll grow high-single-digits for the foreseeable future and we're the leader in that space. And we've expected 8% to 12% annual income growth out of that operating segment on a go forward basis and we've delivered that historically. However, we don't feel like everyone understands or appreciates the power of that business today, because historically, when it was lumped together with the rest of Evernorth, it was easy to say that's a big PBM. Yet, the reality is the specialty pharmacy business is really a heavy duty clinical care delivery model in a really attractive, highly growing addressable market. And so we wanted to put a spotlight on that for investors and allow you all to see the fact that that's going to be a very high growth business for the company and ideally think of it from a valuation standpoint differently than what the rest of Evernorth is, which is our Pharmacy Benefits Services platform, which we expect to grow 2% to 4% going forward. So it'll still grow and still has secular tailwinds, but not to the 8% to 12% growth rate of the Specialty and Care Services platform. So that's why we decided to go down that route, Kevin. We have a lot of questions and we wanted to put a spotlight on the high growth subsegment that we have within Evernorth.\nKevin Fischbeck: And I guess maybe to that point, I think since this was the first quarter where we could look at it, it's optically looked a little bit strange when the PBM business grew so much off the Centene contract, but the specialty business didn't seem to get the same lift. Can you talk about why specialty didn't get the same bump that PBM did?\nBrian Evanko: Sure, yes. And you're right. We had the benefit of the Centene contract onboarding in the Pharmacy Benefits Services operating segment. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter growth, it's very high in excess of 40% in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. Now, the Specialty and Care Services still grew 12% year-over-year, so nothing to sneeze at in that regard. But to your point, the Centene recognition, if you will in terms of where the financial show up is largely in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. So we have our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy as one of the specialty pharmacy options for Centene customers, but it's not exclusive. It's one of the options. So to the extent that a Centene customer fills a script at our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, we recognize it in that subsegment. But the Lion's share of the relationship is in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform today.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. And when you think about that 8% to 12% growth algorithm, like how should we think about it? What are the key drivers to that?\nBrian Evanko: The most significant driver of that is the core secular growth in the specialty pharmacy market. And what I mean by that is looking back over the past decade or so, much of the innovation in health care has been in medical devices. Now we're starting to see pharmaceutical innovation not even in the early innings we're starting to get in the middle innings of pharmaceutical innovation over the next decade really being the next wave of health care. And the specialty pharmacy market in particular will see a lot of that. So whether it's gene therapies, Alzheimer's drugs, we're seeing right now the effect of GLP-1s starting to ramp, as you all know. Those are all examples of drug innovation that will drive high secular growth in that $400 billion specialty pharmacy market. And our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy today, we have depending on which measure you use in the 20% market share range, something along those lines. We have a scaled business in a high growing subsector with a lot of clinical experts, because these are high cost drugs. Often, they require temperature control or they require specific administration in a person's house or in a physician's office. So these are high cost drugs. This is not going down to your local drugstore and picking up a generic. They're complicated specialty drugs and we're really well positioned. So that's the primary driver of the 8% to 12% growth within there. The two others that I would highlight are we have a Distribution business for specialty pharmacy as well called CuraScript. It's been growing double-digits for many years. And we have an opportunity to see that grow, at an even faster rate on a go forward basis as more biosimilars are brought to market and more competition for high cost branded drugs enters the markets, we got an opportunity there. And then our Behavioral Health business, we have an opportunity for outsized growth there as well. Today, that's a relatively small part of the company, but there's a tremendous amount of demand for mental health right now both from our Cigna Healthcare customers, but also our external and affiliated clients that Evernorth serves. So all those things taken together lead to the 8% to 12% expectation.\nKevin Fischbeck: That at last one, so the first two were actually kind of specialty drug driven the last one, that's a medical management overlay, not a pharmaceutical?\nBrian Evanko: Correct. Yes. So from the standpoint of trying to keep things simple, only having two operating segments in Evernorth, the specialty and care services includes primarily specialty pharmaceutical, but we have some health care services in there as well things like behavioral health, things like our MDLive Virtual Care, things like our EviCore medical benefits management.\nKevin Fischbeck: And so it seems like everyone is talking about adding more of these services and these carve out benefits. I mean, what you -- how would you characterize the competitive environment today for these types of things like behavioral? It seems like, again, Elevance is doing it, United has been doing it, you're doing it like how do you win in that market?\nBrian Evanko: I think to this point, it's important to sub segment the employer space a bit more. I think your question is probably geared to the employer market, if I heard you right there. So the under 500 market that I was referencing earlier, we have outsized growth opportunity, what we call the select segment within Cigna Healthcare. Generally speaking, those employers are buying the full suite of solutions from us. They're not going through procurement for mental health separately from their medical benefits, separately from their prescription drug. They're generally buying the full suite of solutions from us. That's a function of generally, small HR departments. They want simplicity as opposed to having to go through complicated procurements and having to manage multiple partners. As you go upmarket, into the over 500 space and then eventually up into the largest employers, there tends to be more of the a la carte or multi-partner procurements. And so, that tends to be the case -- that's been the case for a long time. That's still the case. We're seeing a little bit of -- we use the term point solution fatigue where some of our largest clients I'd spend a lot of time with them in my Cigna Healthcare role have said, I've over time invested in some of these smaller point solutions, and they're not really paying back the way that I thought they would. So I'm looking for a more integrated solution, which presents an opportunity for us and some of our large scale competitors to see some consolidation from the point solution vendors. But broadly speaking, down market, we have everything in if we sell to the client. Up market, it's a bit more fragmented today with some opportunity for consolidation.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. Can you talk a little bit about, the PBM environment? You guys just won a large contract. Anything to highlight there as far as over the next year or two that anything you have up for re-procurement or any larger contracts that might be coming to market?\nBrian Evanko: The Centene contract that was just effective 1,124, far and away bigger than anything else that's in the kind of short to intermediate horizon for us. And for '25, we'd expect based on where we sit here in the middle of May, mid-90s or better retention on our PBM book of business, based on where things stand and a few opportunities for new business coming in as well. That's all factored into the forward-looking 2% to 4% average annual growth algorithm for the Pharmacy Benefits Services business, but not anything anywhere near as sizable in the '25 cycle that's we had with Centene.\nKevin Fischbeck: And as far as the Centene contract, I guess last year was a drag, you should prepare for it. This year it's talking more break even and next year you should be at target margins. Is that are you still on track for that dynamic?\nBrian Evanko: We are on track for that dynamic. So we don't intend to every quarter talk about the financial performance of Centene. But that broad picture you just painted is consistent with our latest expectations. '25, we should be at run rate profitability on the contract. And the installation went great. So, we still have regular dialogue with Centene. They've been pleased from everything we've heard in terms of the operational performance, which was not an easy thing to do to bring 20 million new customers over into our environment. We're really pleased with the performance from the team.\nKevin Fischbeck: All right. Great. Can you talk a little bit about, just going back to the Health Plan business, the exchanges? You guys pulled back noticeably on the exchanges in a couple of states. Where are the margins today and how do you view the exchanges going forward?\nBrian Evanko: Sure. So the exchanges are within Cigna Healthcare for us, and you can think of it as this year about a $4 billion book of business from a premium standpoint. So within Cigna Healthcare, that represents under 10% of the total, but it's an area we see growth opportunity on a go forward basis. Now, we had to do some repositioning in '24, because '23 in two of our largest states with the benefit of hindsight, we underpriced the business in two of those states. And so we went through, a new product positioning as well as a repricing exercise in two of those states, which led to a reduction in membership year-to-date, as we expected. So the good news for us is we've delivered '24 where we needed to from the standpoint of fewer customers, but more profitable. As we went through the repricing that I made reference to, our '24 expectations are that the book itself will run slightly below our target margins, and our target margins are 4% to 6% on that business, so we expect to be slightly below that. That's what's incorporated in our guidance. The first quarter and the April experience is consistent with that expectation.\nKevin Fischbeck: Is that would you expect to be at target next year [indiscernible] repricing?\nBrian Evanko: Barring any unforeseen events, that will be our expectation.\nKevin Fischbeck: I think you guys have a longer term view that that business will grow, is it 10% to 15%?\nBrian Evanko: Yes. So inherent in our -- in Cigna Healthcare, we expect average annual income growth of 7% to 10%. Within that, we expect the individual exchanges to grow 10% to 15%. So the weighted effect of 10% to 15% versus the other components gets to 7% to 10% at the total Cigna Healthcare level. Part of that for us is addressable market expansion, since we're only in about a dozen states. So we have new states we can get into. Some of the existing geographies, our market share is lower, so there's opportunity there. And ultimately, that $4 billion of premium we see growing in time. Not that the entire company, of course, isn't predicated on that business performing, but we see it as an important part of the health care system.\nKevin Fischbeck: Is that the only part of your commercial business that was kind of under target? Are you generally speaking back to target margin and commercial outside of exchanges?\nBrian Evanko: Yes. So Cigna Healthcare, if you think of the components, the U.S. Employer business essentially at target margins, the International Health business essentially at target margins, the individual exchange a little bit below as we just talked about. And then our Medicare business, which we're in the process of divesting currently weighed down by SG&A, so it's below targets. Although the medical care ratios are not out of line with where we would expect.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay. It's interesting. It feels to me like Cigna is in a pretty good spot right now. When I think about next year, there's not really any obvious headwinds that I can see to your business. So next year you're going to have trends going to remain high, unit costs seem to be driving commercial trend and that's probably going to be high again next year. So that's good for revenue growth. You've got the Centene contract ramping up. It sounds like the RFP pipeline is going well on the PBM side. So it seems like everything's kind of going well in your favor. Is there anything we should be thinking about from a headwind perspective that, is an offset or anything that keeps you up at night as far as next year's growth goes?\nBrian Evanko: I hate to say there are no headwinds, but there are no known headwinds that are sizable that I would highlight, and I broadly agree with the framing that you provided there. And actually, two months ago on our Investor Day, you all may have noticed we increased the ceiling of our EPS growth algorithm on a go forward basis. It was 10% to 13% for a long time. We increased it to 10% to 14%, because we see the next several years being opportunities for strong rates of growth, despite it being a pretty disrupted environment that we're operating within. So whether that's -- the forces you described or the drug innovation that I made reference to, all those things contribute to our businesses being really well positioned for the next few years and not a specific one, two, three headwinds that I would call out as we step into '25. Of course, we always have to respect the fact that medical cost utilization could be higher than expectations. And of course, we're always going to be investing in operating expense or making investments in strategic capabilities that could weigh on operating expenses in any given time period. But broadly speaking, don't see any notable one time headwinds.\nKevin Fischbeck: Yes. And then, you talked a bit about the share repo that you're doing this year. You guys are in the process of doing the first $5 billion. What's the appetite or ability to do it to continue share repo on the back half of the year? And your good debt to cap is in Q1 was 44%. You guys usually talk about 40% as the target. How does that play into how you think about share repo and the timing?\nBrian Evanko: Yes. So we've continued to see our shares as a great use of our deployable capital, which is one of the reasons we've done so much share repurchase the last few years. And in '24, we've committed to the majority of our discretionary cash flow going for share repurchase. We're on track to deliver against the commitment we made, which is at least $5 million by the end of the first half of '24, so at least $5 billion to share repurchase. So we've we initiated a $3.2 billion ASR in February that will complete by the end of this month. And then we'll do some open market repurchase to achieve that goal by the end of June. So we're fortunate to have the cash generation that allows us the flexibility to do this sort of repurchase. And as you think about the back half of the year, even after you remove CapEx and you remove shareholder dividends, there's still call it, $3 billion or so of fungible cash that will be available for deployment between either some debt repayment to the extent we de-lever a bit or to the extent we see a strategic M&A opportunity. So we see those buckets as a bit fungible in the back half of the year, but we continue to see share repurchase as a very attractive lever for the company. To your point on debt, we were a little bit elevated in the first quarter from the timing of our debt issuance, which was part -- in part to fund the ASR. We also had, a write off of one of our assets that temporarily elevated the debt to cap. Over time, we're committed to a 40% debt to cap ratio. That's what we've aligned with our rating agencies on. And so the times we'll be above that. We were at 40% at the end of the year. So we'll de-lever down to that level at some point.\nKevin Fischbeck: And I guess when you think about -- you guys talk about 65% of your cash flow either going to M&A or share repo. And I appreciate, viewing your own stock as attractive. We do too. But if you think about M&A, one of the pushbacks that I have on Cigna's strategic capital deployment, it just seems like that there should be something out there that could kind of push the company forward. But since you bought Express Scripts, you've raised more money in asset sales than you've deployed on acquisitions. And so it feels like everyone around you is kind of more aggressive on deploying capital. So what are your thoughts about, I don't want to say it's an arms race, but like -- are you missing out on anything? Is there anything that you look at today and say, yes, it would be better to have this or that?\nBrian Evanko: Yes, we see M&A as an important part of our capital deployment strategy, so full stop. And even though, to your point, there haven't been as many high dollar, high profile acquisitions since we acquired Express Scripts, it's a constant area of review and focus for us strategically. So to your point, 60% to 65% of our capital available for deployment we see as fungible between M&A and repurchase, but we're not going to sit on cash either. So if there's not an attractive M&A prospect, we're going to use the repurchase lever because we view our stock as a very good investment, with where we sit today. Now strategic M&A for us falls into a few different categories. There's where can we improve our competitive position and our competitive advantage in our existing businesses. So I went through the different components of the company earlier. And then there's where can we expand our addressable market, our reach, which could be in Cigna Healthcare. We talked about a few of the lines where we don't have a presence or we won't have a presence in the future or it could be in Evernorth where we have more opportunities for services, particularly health services. So those are examples of areas that we're constantly looking at. But importantly, every asset needs to be viewed individually and we put it through the lens of does it strategically push the company forward, is it financially attractive, meaning accretive over time and meeting return on capital expectations, And can we get it done, both from the standpoint of having the right counterparty and getting through antitrust.\nKevin Fischbeck: I guess I understand getting into new markets or getting to new geographies. What does it mean, say, to improve your competitive positioning? Like what does that mean?\nBrian Evanko: So in the three large scaled assets I made reference to Cigna Healthcare, Specialty and Care Services and Pharmacy Benefits Services, there are examples of ways where we can further extend our advantage into subsectors. So, in Cigna Healthcare, we have certain geographies where we're less competitive. In the Specialty and Care Services business, we're a little more nascent as it relates to serving health systems and hospitals. Those are examples of within already large scale businesses where there could be an advantage to build.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, I think that is all we have time for. Thank you very much.\nBrian Evanko: Thanks Kevin. I appreciate the time.\nEnd of Q&A:",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Evanko",
            "content": "Sure, Kevin. And thanks to you and Bank of America for hosting us here this week. As it relates to utilization, in 2023 across the board, we saw strong levels of utilization in our Cigna Healthcare health plan book, which is something we had priced for, guided for and included in our projections. And so as a result of that, you would have seen we had a strong year in Cigna Healthcare in 2023. The MCR performance was strong. The revenue growth was strong, in spite of what were elevated levels of utilization compared to 2020, 2021, 2022. So '23 was a stronger year of utilization. As we stepped into '24, we assumed those strong levels of utilization would continue through the entire year. So our pricing anticipated that, our guidance anticipated that and our projections did as well. So we are pleased with our first quarter results coming in better than expectations in Cigna Healthcare, where the MCR was better than we had projected and also the income was ahead of expectations, which again we come back to the firm pricing that we've had in the market, 2024 reflecting that utilization, is consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. So far, the second quarter is largely in line with what we had expected coming out of the first quarter, which again is persistently high utilization levels relative to what we had in '23. In the first quarter, we had strong levels of inpatient utilization, a little bit of decelerating outpatient and surgery utilization, but still at high levels in absolute terms. So that's broadly how I would think about the picture we're seeing at The Cigna group. The Medicare Advantage book for us and granted we only have about 600,000 lives, so it may not be representative of the nation, has been broadly in line with our projections. Strong levels of utilization, '23 persisted through the first quarter of '24. So I wouldn't call it out as a significant outlier relative to our commercial employer experience. Yes, if you step back and think about the company in total, we've got three scaled growth platforms. We've got Cigna Healthcare, which is our health plan business. That's about 40% of our income. And our commercial employer business is the cornerstone in Cigna Healthcare. We've got our Evernorth Specialty and Care Services platform, which is about 30% of the company, which we expect to grow 8% to 12% per year on average. And then we have our Pharmacy Benefits Services business in Evernorth, that's about 30% of the company that we expect low- to mid-single-digit type growth on an ongoing basis. So three large scaled platforms. You asked specifically about the commercial employer business that's in Cigna Healthcare, which again is our health plan business. We've had a long track record of success here and part of it's the focus and the expertise that we've built up over time. But the opportunity we have going forward for disproportionately high growth is in the under 500 employer size segment, what we call the Select segment. So you can think of this employers who have between 50 and 500 employees. Today, we have about 7% market share. That's up from it was 5% just five years ago. So our share has been gradually building and we see the opportunity for that to eventually get into the double-digits from share standpoint, which is where our over 500 market share is today in the commercial employer space. We see that as a significant opportunity going forward. The reason we've been successful in that space is both improved affordability at a local market level, but also a very consultative model, that we've employed with employers from the standpoint of understanding how health benefits can be a weapon for them relative to talent attraction and retention and the fact that we're agnostic to funding arrangements. So we've for a long time had ASO or self-funded arrangements in the down market segment, which some of our competitors have been reluctant to do because it's lower revenue, even though it's very attractive from a profitability standpoint. So that's the subsegment within commercial employer that we're most excited about growth going forward. Yes, the Select segment, I'll come back to the core of the question, the Select segment, you can think of as having more rolling renewal dates. So because these are smaller employers, they're -- it's not as concentrated on January 1st. So we tend to see intra-year growth, in that sub-segment specifically, so the under-500 Select segment. So we'll see throughout the year growth, in terms of sequential lives into 2024. As it relates to your point on the larger segments, if you look at our middle markets and national accounts, we did have some self-funded fee based clients that were lost for 1124. We knew about that because from the standpoint of the pricing environment, we didn't chase the pricing. So not material to our income, but they did create a dent to the lives on 1124. Now that's on the heels of a couple of years of really strong growth. If you go back and look at where we were at the end of '21, our commercial employer book now is much bigger, 2 million, 3 million lives bigger. So it's we've had a lot of growth. But in this specific time period, we had a couple of known employer losses, Kevin. Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as more competitive in general because these are only -- there were two significant fee based clients. So out of the 100s that we serve in that space, I wouldn't necessarily conclude it's more competitive. We're broadly seeing rational pricing from our competitors. But here and there, you'll see a situation, where the pricing is a bit aggressive. We do. In the employer business, we expect there to be intra-year growth in the lives such that the full-year commercial employer book, year-end '24 versus year-end '23 should be flat to potentially up a bit. There's a few different questions in there, so maybe I'll try to go deliberately through this to make sure the audience understands all the pieces in our thought process. So to your point, we're in the process of divesting our Medicare businesses as we speak to HCSC on track for early 2025 closing date of that. We've completed the DOJ review process. We got through the federal antitrust review already, so a couple of key milestones have already been met. Again, on track to deliver that divestiture in the first quarter or early part of 2025. Stepping back, though, why would we divest the business, I think is more where you were going with the question. We continue to see the Medicare subsector of the U.S. healthcare space as an attractive part of the U.S. healthcare market. So this was not a verdict about Medicare not being an attractive subsector. But for us, relative to where The Cigna Group is positioned, our strengths, our existing assets and where we can create the most value, we concluded that given its relatively small size in our portfolio, the amount of human capital and financial investment that would be required to scale it to a level that's significant for our company was too tall of a task and that it was best in someone else's hands. So that's what led to the decision to divest the business. So this was not a verdict about the Medicare market. It was relative to the size of our company and the things that we're prioritizing and focusing in. So I talked about specialty pharmacy earlier, our commercial employer business and the strength in our Pharmacy Benefits Services platforms. Those are getting disproportionate investment resources and we have a sustained right to win in each of them. Now, stepping back from that, our Evernorth Health Services business serves a lot of Medicare lives today. We serve a lot of Medicaid lives today, particularly with the win of Centene that has now gone effective, January 1st into our book. So we now serve 20 million or so so customers of Centene across Medicaid, Medicare and across the entire Evernorth portfolio. About 30% of all the customers we serve there are government sponsored: Medicaid, Medicare, DoD. So between our Pharmacy Benefits Services, specialty pharmacy, we serve a lot of Medicare, Medicaid, government lives, but through the services chassis as opposed to the health plan chassis. So in the long run, not having a health plan presence presents an opportunity for us strategically, something we could consider. It's not necessarily in the near-term where we're going to be focused, but it's an opportunity in the long-term for us to consider. Similarly to Medicare, after the divestiture, we won't have any health plan presence in Cigna Healthcare. And as we go through our strategic reviews of any decision that we make, we'll assess Medicare, Medicaid and other lines where we're not active. So I wouldn't say we have a stronger view of one versus the other in terms of the relative attractiveness. Ultimately, it'll come back to, as we think about the criteria for where we invest or the criteria for M&A, each of the specific situations would need to be -- need to be carefully reviewed. We have concluded that we don't intend to organically enter Medicaid or Medicare. So if we are in those lines in the health plan business, it would be through some sort of acquisition down the line. Sure. Yes, so starting in the first quarter, we divided the Evernorth business into two operating segments or subsegments. And again, stepping back, Evernorth is a health services platform for Cigna. It's about 60% of our income. And then Cigna Healthcare is the health plan, about 40%. So the 60% we divided into the two components. And part of this was we had a lot of questions coming in from investors to help us understand the pieces better. But also part of it is we wanted to make sure, we really put a spotlight on the Specialty and Care Services platform, which can you think of each of them as approximately equal today in terms of their contribution, 30% of the total company's income from both of those two operating segments. We found many people were taking our specialty pharmacy business and grouping it with the rest of our Pharmacy Benefits Services business and just thinking of that as a prescription drug oriented business. Yes, the two have very different growth profiles going forward. So the Specialty and Care Services business, $400 billion addressable market, it'll grow high-single-digits for the foreseeable future and we're the leader in that space. And we've expected 8% to 12% annual income growth out of that operating segment on a go forward basis and we've delivered that historically. However, we don't feel like everyone understands or appreciates the power of that business today, because historically, when it was lumped together with the rest of Evernorth, it was easy to say that's a big PBM. Yet, the reality is the specialty pharmacy business is really a heavy duty clinical care delivery model in a really attractive, highly growing addressable market. And so we wanted to put a spotlight on that for investors and allow you all to see the fact that that's going to be a very high growth business for the company and ideally think of it from a valuation standpoint differently than what the rest of Evernorth is, which is our Pharmacy Benefits Services platform, which we expect to grow 2% to 4% going forward. So it'll still grow and still has secular tailwinds, but not to the 8% to 12% growth rate of the Specialty and Care Services platform. So that's why we decided to go down that route, Kevin. We have a lot of questions and we wanted to put a spotlight on the high growth subsegment that we have within Evernorth. Sure, yes. And you're right. We had the benefit of the Centene contract onboarding in the Pharmacy Benefits Services operating segment. So if you look at the quarter-over-quarter growth, it's very high in excess of 40% in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. Now, the Specialty and Care Services still grew 12% year-over-year, so nothing to sneeze at in that regard. But to your point, the Centene recognition, if you will in terms of where the financial show up is largely in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform. So we have our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy as one of the specialty pharmacy options for Centene customers, but it's not exclusive. It's one of the options. So to the extent that a Centene customer fills a script at our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy, we recognize it in that subsegment. But the Lion's share of the relationship is in the Pharmacy Benefits Services platform today. The most significant driver of that is the core secular growth in the specialty pharmacy market. And what I mean by that is looking back over the past decade or so, much of the innovation in health care has been in medical devices. Now we're starting to see pharmaceutical innovation not even in the early innings we're starting to get in the middle innings of pharmaceutical innovation over the next decade really being the next wave of health care. And the specialty pharmacy market in particular will see a lot of that. So whether it's gene therapies, Alzheimer's drugs, we're seeing right now the effect of GLP-1s starting to ramp, as you all know. Those are all examples of drug innovation that will drive high secular growth in that $400 billion specialty pharmacy market. And our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy today, we have depending on which measure you use in the 20% market share range, something along those lines. We have a scaled business in a high growing subsector with a lot of clinical experts, because these are high cost drugs. Often, they require temperature control or they require specific administration in a person's house or in a physician's office. So these are high cost drugs. This is not going down to your local drugstore and picking up a generic. They're complicated specialty drugs and we're really well positioned. So that's the primary driver of the 8% to 12% growth within there. The two others that I would highlight are we have a Distribution business for specialty pharmacy as well called CuraScript. It's been growing double-digits for many years. And we have an opportunity to see that grow, at an even faster rate on a go forward basis as more biosimilars are brought to market and more competition for high cost branded drugs enters the markets, we got an opportunity there. And then our Behavioral Health business, we have an opportunity for outsized growth there as well. Today, that's a relatively small part of the company, but there's a tremendous amount of demand for mental health right now both from our Cigna Healthcare customers, but also our external and affiliated clients that Evernorth serves. So all those things taken together lead to the 8% to 12% expectation. Correct. Yes. So from the standpoint of trying to keep things simple, only having two operating segments in Evernorth, the specialty and care services includes primarily specialty pharmaceutical, but we have some health care services in there as well things like behavioral health, things like our MDLive Virtual Care, things like our EviCore medical benefits management. I think to this point, it's important to sub segment the employer space a bit more. I think your question is probably geared to the employer market, if I heard you right there. So the under 500 market that I was referencing earlier, we have outsized growth opportunity, what we call the select segment within Cigna Healthcare. Generally speaking, those employers are buying the full suite of solutions from us. They're not going through procurement for mental health separately from their medical benefits, separately from their prescription drug. They're generally buying the full suite of solutions from us. That's a function of generally, small HR departments. They want simplicity as opposed to having to go through complicated procurements and having to manage multiple partners. As you go upmarket, into the over 500 space and then eventually up into the largest employers, there tends to be more of the a la carte or multi-partner procurements. And so, that tends to be the case -- that's been the case for a long time. That's still the case. We're seeing a little bit of -- we use the term point solution fatigue where some of our largest clients I'd spend a lot of time with them in my Cigna Healthcare role have said, I've over time invested in some of these smaller point solutions, and they're not really paying back the way that I thought they would. So I'm looking for a more integrated solution, which presents an opportunity for us and some of our large scale competitors to see some consolidation from the point solution vendors. But broadly speaking, down market, we have everything in if we sell to the client. Up market, it's a bit more fragmented today with some opportunity for consolidation. The Centene contract that was just effective 1,124, far and away bigger than anything else that's in the kind of short to intermediate horizon for us. And for '25, we'd expect based on where we sit here in the middle of May, mid-90s or better retention on our PBM book of business, based on where things stand and a few opportunities for new business coming in as well. That's all factored into the forward-looking 2% to 4% average annual growth algorithm for the Pharmacy Benefits Services business, but not anything anywhere near as sizable in the '25 cycle that's we had with Centene. We are on track for that dynamic. So we don't intend to every quarter talk about the financial performance of Centene. But that broad picture you just painted is consistent with our latest expectations. '25, we should be at run rate profitability on the contract. And the installation went great. So, we still have regular dialogue with Centene. They've been pleased from everything we've heard in terms of the operational performance, which was not an easy thing to do to bring 20 million new customers over into our environment. We're really pleased with the performance from the team. Sure. So the exchanges are within Cigna Healthcare for us, and you can think of it as this year about a $4 billion book of business from a premium standpoint. So within Cigna Healthcare, that represents under 10% of the total, but it's an area we see growth opportunity on a go forward basis. Now, we had to do some repositioning in '24, because '23 in two of our largest states with the benefit of hindsight, we underpriced the business in two of those states. And so we went through, a new product positioning as well as a repricing exercise in two of those states, which led to a reduction in membership year-to-date, as we expected. So the good news for us is we've delivered '24 where we needed to from the standpoint of fewer customers, but more profitable. As we went through the repricing that I made reference to, our '24 expectations are that the book itself will run slightly below our target margins, and our target margins are 4% to 6% on that business, so we expect to be slightly below that. That's what's incorporated in our guidance. The first quarter and the April experience is consistent with that expectation. Barring any unforeseen events, that will be our expectation. Yes. So inherent in our -- in Cigna Healthcare, we expect average annual income growth of 7% to 10%. Within that, we expect the individual exchanges to grow 10% to 15%. So the weighted effect of 10% to 15% versus the other components gets to 7% to 10% at the total Cigna Healthcare level. Part of that for us is addressable market expansion, since we're only in about a dozen states. So we have new states we can get into. Some of the existing geographies, our market share is lower, so there's opportunity there. And ultimately, that $4 billion of premium we see growing in time. Not that the entire company, of course, isn't predicated on that business performing, but we see it as an important part of the health care system. Yes. So Cigna Healthcare, if you think of the components, the U.S. Employer business essentially at target margins, the International Health business essentially at target margins, the individual exchange a little bit below as we just talked about. And then our Medicare business, which we're in the process of divesting currently weighed down by SG&A, so it's below targets. Although the medical care ratios are not out of line with where we would expect. I hate to say there are no headwinds, but there are no known headwinds that are sizable that I would highlight, and I broadly agree with the framing that you provided there. And actually, two months ago on our Investor Day, you all may have noticed we increased the ceiling of our EPS growth algorithm on a go forward basis. It was 10% to 13% for a long time. We increased it to 10% to 14%, because we see the next several years being opportunities for strong rates of growth, despite it being a pretty disrupted environment that we're operating within. So whether that's -- the forces you described or the drug innovation that I made reference to, all those things contribute to our businesses being really well positioned for the next few years and not a specific one, two, three headwinds that I would call out as we step into '25. Of course, we always have to respect the fact that medical cost utilization could be higher than expectations. And of course, we're always going to be investing in operating expense or making investments in strategic capabilities that could weigh on operating expenses in any given time period. But broadly speaking, don't see any notable one time headwinds. Yes. So we've continued to see our shares as a great use of our deployable capital, which is one of the reasons we've done so much share repurchase the last few years. And in '24, we've committed to the majority of our discretionary cash flow going for share repurchase. We're on track to deliver against the commitment we made, which is at least $5 million by the end of the first half of '24, so at least $5 billion to share repurchase. So we've we initiated a $3.2 billion ASR in February that will complete by the end of this month. And then we'll do some open market repurchase to achieve that goal by the end of June. So we're fortunate to have the cash generation that allows us the flexibility to do this sort of repurchase. And as you think about the back half of the year, even after you remove CapEx and you remove shareholder dividends, there's still call it, $3 billion or so of fungible cash that will be available for deployment between either some debt repayment to the extent we de-lever a bit or to the extent we see a strategic M&A opportunity. So we see those buckets as a bit fungible in the back half of the year, but we continue to see share repurchase as a very attractive lever for the company. To your point on debt, we were a little bit elevated in the first quarter from the timing of our debt issuance, which was part -- in part to fund the ASR. We also had, a write off of one of our assets that temporarily elevated the debt to cap. Over time, we're committed to a 40% debt to cap ratio. That's what we've aligned with our rating agencies on. And so the times we'll be above that. We were at 40% at the end of the year. So we'll de-lever down to that level at some point. Yes, we see M&A as an important part of our capital deployment strategy, so full stop. And even though, to your point, there haven't been as many high dollar, high profile acquisitions since we acquired Express Scripts, it's a constant area of review and focus for us strategically. So to your point, 60% to 65% of our capital available for deployment we see as fungible between M&A and repurchase, but we're not going to sit on cash either. So if there's not an attractive M&A prospect, we're going to use the repurchase lever because we view our stock as a very good investment, with where we sit today. Now strategic M&A for us falls into a few different categories. There's where can we improve our competitive position and our competitive advantage in our existing businesses. So I went through the different components of the company earlier. And then there's where can we expand our addressable market, our reach, which could be in Cigna Healthcare.

So those are examples of areas that we're constantly looking at. But importantly, every asset needs to be viewed individually and we put it through the lens of does it strategically push the company forward, is it financially attractive, meaning accretive over time and meeting return on capital expectations, And can we get it done, both from the standpoint of having the right counterparty and getting through antitrust. So in the three large scaled assets I made reference to Cigna Healthcare, Specialty and Care Services and Pharmacy Benefits Services, there are examples of ways where we can further extend our advantage into subsectors. So, in Cigna Healthcare, we have certain geographies where we're less competitive. In the Specialty and Care Services business, we're a little more nascent as it relates to serving health systems and hospitals. Those are examples of within already large scale businesses where there could be an advantage to build. Thanks Kevin. I appreciate the time."
